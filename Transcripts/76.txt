TITLE: Client "L" Therapy Session Audio Recording, March 20, 2013: Client is concerned about his wife; she is experiencing intense emotional swings and near constant thoughts of suicide.
DESCRIPTION: Client is concerned about his wife; she is experiencing intense emotional swings and near constant thoughts of suicide.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in. [Do you want some water?] (ph).
CLIENT: (Pause), Hi. (Pause), (door closes), (pause). Need help?
THERAPIST: Thank you, thank you. (Pause).
CLIENT: So I'm not sure where we are this week. I guess left off you suggested that it would be you could see how it would be easy for me to be disappointed often, (pause), which I think is probably right, but (pause), yeah, I think that's right. [00:01:07]
THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:01:49], (pause).
CLIENT: So there's that, (pause), Tanya's been doing some tutoring, so she's found a couple of people that want her as a tutor, and she's doing that. That's good. I feel like she's also really struggling with the job search, in the emotions management portions of it.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: (Pause), [inaudible at 00:02:52] have been getting harder for her over the last week, and (pause), if it gets too much harder, we're going to be in not a good place, so I don't know where that's going.
THERAPIST: And how do you mean?
CLIENT: (Pause), I think she's starting to have suicidal thoughts again, so I think that if it gets too much harder, she's going to spend most of her time in suicidal thoughts. And while she's survived that several times, that's not a place that I want to be or I want her to be because that would [inaudible ","P1-N400231":"at 00:03:39].
THERAPIST: What to do? What you should do?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I mean how what should I do? What should she do? What does she need to do? What can I help her do? What yeah.
THERAPIST: (Pause), yeah, (pause). It feels like something needs to be done?
CLIENT: (Pause), (crying), it feels like whatever strategy's being taken to manage, (pause), the whole thing is not quite coping, so yeah, I think something needs to be done. [00:07:10]
THERAPIST: What do you mean not quite coping?
CLIENT: So (pause), I feel like the (pause), the emotion management is not keeping up with the feelings.
THERAPIST: Okay, so?
CLIENT: So, so (pause), she is starting to get overwhelmed by her own feelings of inadequacy and failure, and whatever and whatever. And so yeah, I think something needs to change.
THERAPIST: I am.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I don't think anything's changing. I mean over time the hope is that Tanya that these conflicts will be less disruptive to her life. I imagine they're always going to be with her, that they're there with the illness (ph).
CLIENT: (Sniffs), I think what I'm trying to say is that things are changing for the worse. And if they can change for the worse, they can change for the better at the same rate, or they ought to be able to or they should at least be able to stay the same, if they're getting ...
THERAPIST: But what feels like it's getting worse? I mean it sounds like Tanya's doing better in many respects.
CLIENT: (Pause), I feel like she has been doing better and is starting to do worse again. (Pause), so her memory has started to be more whole from the ACT, and that's a really good thing. She's started to apply for jobs. She's been applying for jobs for several weeks now. (Pause). [00:11:15].
THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?
CLIENT: (Pause), I was thinking about different ways to interpret what you were saying. One way to interpret it is that this is not going away. There is no obvious solution to this. (Pause), (sigh), (pause), or there's not solution to this or something like that.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I think that's true too. I mean I guess I was when you were saying things were getting worse and you described what worse was, I was like well, actually it sounds like things are staying the same. I mean things are getting worse relative to a week ago. But -
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:16:14]
THERAPIST: In the grand scheme of things, things are basically the same.
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: Whereas Tanya is -
CLIENT: Okay. Okay.
THERAPIST: You know, dangling on suicidal thoughts. Moving away and toward them at times, but there.
CLIENT: Sure. You know that's right. Over the course of the time I've been seeing you, it's not any worse. But yeah, relative to last week and the week before, it's worse. That's concerning when it looked like things were getting a little better.
THERAPIST: Well yeah. So many thoughts I feel like there's a couple of different conversations we could have.
CLIENT: (Laughs).
THERAPIST: That we should have but I guess, what is your vision for what you think would be possible for Tanya, or what you want, which also may be two different issues. [00:17:18]
CLIENT: I think it's probably two different issues.
THERAPIST: Well than you can feel free to go with either one.
CLIENT: (Pause), you know, what I want really is to have Tanya back. To have her be healthy and be able to live in the world again, to, (pause), have fulfilling work and enjoy life, and to be a partner to me, and (pause), that's what I really want.
THERAPIST: Well it seems like it's not clear where there are limits that you're hitting up on, or are they virtual or real.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (Pause).
THERAPIST: Something that I thought about after, you know, what we talked about last week, are sort of limits in terms of what people do, do, creating organizations or structures or whatever, that are far from my deal. Are they virtual limits that can be worked through? Or are those just sort of the ","P1-N4008B1":"limits of human nature -
CLIENT: (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: That people -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Tend to sort of look at their feet rather than around the world. How do I make a living and take care of my family versus how do I do things that are noble and are those is that just virtual limits that people could push beyond them if they wanted to. Or is it just endemic to human nature?
CLIENT: (Pause), yeah, I don't know the answer to that either, but it does tie in here doesn't it? [00:20:30]
THERAPIST: It does.
CLIENT: And I tend to think again that people are very powerful. that not in every moment can we break through those virtual limits, so they become real in some sense. But (pause), with sustained vision and effort, I think we can break through many of those virtual limits. And so if they were real ","P1-N400991":"boundaries, they I don't think they could be as frustrating for [a minute] (ph).
THERAPIST: Right, but it brings us back to the question of what's real or not.
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: Are they real or are they virtual?
CLIENT: You know you're right. That is a very begging (ph) question.
THERAPIST: That very much begs the question.
CLIENT: (Pause), yeah, just I really don't know. I it's one of these things. I feel like it's related to that, (pause), discussion we had about powerlessness. You said well no, it's a feeling. [00:21:45]
THERAPIST: It's so interesting, and I think you're right. And the question is, does it make it so? Or does it acknowledge something that's already there? I was thinking, if I told you here I tied a string to a 747 and I said pull this -
CLIENT: (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: A hundred yards. Now you're saying I'm powerless to do so. Is that making something real that wasn't already? Or are you just pointing out the obvious?
CLIENT: Fair enough.
THERAPIST: What's interesting about that example is there's a competition, I think in New Hampshire, where teams of people get together and pull I think it's 737s, and see how far you can pull it.
CLIENT: (Laughs).
THERAPIST: Or actually it's not that. In a given amount of time or no, no, no in a given amount of time, how far you can pull it something like that. So actually you can, if there's enough people maybe this goes to your point. If there's enough people you can actually you can pull a 737. They ","P1-N400B51":"use FED EX planes for this competition. [00:22:53]
CLIENT: (Laughs).
THERAPIST: They call it a bizarre. But anyway ...
CLIENT: That's pretty cool though.
THERAPIST: It is very cool. You know, it's fun. It's a very good so this is not a serious professional sport. It's kind of a good sport -
CLIENT: (Laughs).
THERAPIST: Kind of a funny thing to do.
CLIENT: Yeah, (pause), yeah I feel like that's a good story. It gets, (pause), gets pretty far into the question. It is one of those questions that I don't have really good direct answers to, because stories are, (pause), a decent way of gesturing at it.
THERAPIST: Right. It depends on what the question is.
CLIENT: Exactly.
THERAPIST: The question is can this be moved versus can you personally, on your own move right. It depends on how the situation is framed.
CLIENT: Right. Well even, can you personally, on your own, what does that mean? If I go and I ask enough people and I get them together to pull it, have I done that? Have I moved it on my own? [00:24:58]
THERAPIST: This is a very far reaching and bold statement. But my first I'm not totally going (ph) into, but I'll put it out there. My first thought was, whatever amount of control you want over Tanya's illness, I guarantee you'll always have less than that.
CLIENT: (Laughs), (pause), you know, which I think is fine and with it comes the harder to accept whatever amount of control I want Tanya to have over her illness, she will always have less than that, I think might come with that. I'm not sure. [00:26:17]
THERAPIST: Well one interesting thing is that you there are two separate questions. They're equally important, but they're separate that I think sometimes get confused in your mind, because of how you think about it.
CLIENT: I probably still was just trying to get a grip on the question. (Pause), (sniffs), (pause), I'm still not sure I have a very good grip on it, so I don't want to go away from it. But I'm going to tell this short story because I think it might help.
THERAPIST: What do you mean?
CLIENT: There is no way in which I could do anything on that strip. I can't interfere in any way, but I helped him find the reserves and strength that he had, and use them. So does that sound just as tangled up?
THERAPIST: Actually it's an interesting analogy for its similarities and its dissimilarities. Because in that case, I'm sure he wanted it as much for himself, or more so, than you wanted it for him. That's the very issue at hand with Tanya. [00:31:12]
CLIENT: Hmm, (pause), so what you're saying is if Tanya doesn't want it, I can't help her?
THERAPIST: Yeah. You can't make her want it. You can communicate her responsibility to you, but that's still her wanting to keep the responsibility to you and a commitment to you.
CLIENT: (Sniff).
CLIENT: Yeah, I'm really not sure where that leaves me though. (Pause), yeah, at that moment that she wants to kill herself, (pause), there's nothing left. (Pause), which isn't really a revelation, but I think sheds some light on, (pause), why I'm concerned about it getting worse. [00:34:08]
THERAPIST: Well maybe on these days where she's doing slightly better, you have the illusion of control, so you want to sort of you get in there and work it as best as you can, until you feel like it's slipping away? But I think that it still is an illusion.
CLIENT: (Pause), control's kind of a slippery word. Do you have synonyms that fit you?
THERAPIST: I don't know. I like that word so much. It's -
CLIENT: (Laughs).
THERAPIST: Very difficult well, yeah. Let me hear more. Maybe I can find a synonym. (Pause), the power to affect change. [00:35:15]
CLIENT: Okay, okay.
THERAPIST: What didn't you like about control?
CLIENT: I don't want to control Tanya.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: If I were controlling her, like if I had control over her in kind of the, (pause), yeah that, I don't want that. That's not, (pause), (sniff), it's tied up in the wow, (ph) you know, world of controlling spouses and that's tied up in the, (pause), feminist ideals of oppression of women, ","P1-N4010D1":"so control is complicated in that way. Okay? [00:36:28]
THERAPIST: But her sort of will is that she doesn't want to have control. So therein lies the dilemma.
CLIENT: Can you say that again?
THERAPIST: She doesn't want the control. She's not wanting to take control of her life. She doesn't want that. Or at least that's not what she's doing.
CLIENT: Are you telling me what you think or are you telling me what I think right now?
THERAPIST: No I actually am feeling like I'm pointing out objective reality.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: She's feeling I mean this gets into much deeper issues about what's illness and what's motivation, or what's but I mean there's she's not interested in having control over her life. I mean she's not that she's totally not interested in it, but it's not -
CLIENT: It's coming and going.
THERAPIST: It comes and goes. It's far more of a consistent interest to you than for her. There are far other things that are of interest to her than having control over her life that often does not take a very high priority. So that's what I mean by that. [00:38:40]
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, but you know it -
THERAPIST: I'm deeply sympathetic to it. I'm just saying -
CLIENT: (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: Is that when you say, well all I want is this, but you want control over that. You want control over Tanya taking control, if that makes sense. Maybe control isn't the right word.
CLIENT: But it's I think I get the point, I think. Again, I want her to want to be alive. I want her to want to have yeah, no, that's right. Because, yeah I think this really runs back into the real and virtual boundaries that the, (pause), the virtual boundaries are as real as you let them be, ","P1-N4012D1":"if they're virtual.
THERAPIST: Or as Freud really said, "Most mental illness is an illness of motivation. It's an illness of will."
CLIENT: (Pause), I mean I don't know whether it's true or not, but it certainly is a, (pause), is a fairly compelling description of what's happened to her over the last couple of years. She just had the will to keep fighting beaten out of her.
THERAPIST: (Pause), by whom?
CLIENT: (Sigh), yeah that's a really interesting question. I don't know. (Pause), you know, there's a sense in which it was her department at the school. There's a sense in which at the end of the day, (pause) by herself, I think. [00:40:52]
THERAPIST: Well and it's sort of one version of it is to what extent are you a victim of your circumstance versus responsible for your life? A victim of circumstance you let the circumstances be it an abusive childhood, or just a victim of having an illness, or however you define it. [00:42:06]
CLIENT: Right. (Pause), and I think you're always both. I mean, (pause), the circumstances are what they are. They I was born to the parents I was born to. That's never going to change. I have no control over that. I never will.
THERAPIST: I will say on a very practical level that has important emotional implications, or important sort of psychological factors for you is but sort of, I guess in some ways is advice. But sort of assessing Tanya's state on a day-to-day or even week-to-week basis, I think is not going to be productive ","P1-N401451":"for you.
CLIENT: (Laughs).
THERAPIST: I think it's going to drive you crazy is maybe to make a little bit of sense.
CLIENT: (Laughs).
THERAPIST: Because when there's a particular and this is not my professional context but literally just kind of making you feel like you're banging your head against a wall. Because it comes with it a particular kind of either micromanagement or desire for management, and it's like you're holding ","P1-N4014F1":"on to something so tightly, and your hand is cramping. [00:44:23]
CLIENT: (Pause), (sniff), (pause), you made me think of the management styles of a couple of the professors at Illinois. One of them comes in and talks with the students every day all of the students every day.
THERAPIST: That's something interesting for you to bring into your week this week, maybe your [inaudible at 00:46:22] thinking. It's a very interesting analogy, where you went with that. We do need to stop for today.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I will see you next week.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay, take care.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Okay. Bye.
