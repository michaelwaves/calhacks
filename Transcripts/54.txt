DESCRIPTION: Client discusses his plans to go away for the weekend with his girlfriend and is feeling apathetic about their relationship. Client believes that that they are incompatible in many ways and that he will never be able to satisfy her need for attention.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.
CLIENT: How are you?
THERAPIST: Good, thank you.
CLIENT: Warm out there today.
THERAPIST: Yeah, it is.
CLIENT: I just get used to fall, and then…
THERAPIST: And it’s summer again.
CLIENT: Yeah, jeez.
THERAPIST: What a week. It’s been a fun week.
CLIENT: Yeah?
THERAPIST: Crazy. Yeah, talking to Google was an interesting experience. That was… it was good actually. They seem much more likely to negotiate than I thought, so I’m optimistic. But I’m still cautious, because I think there’s a lot more negotiation that has to happen around ","P1-N4001F1":"what… the job I’ll be doing and what that looks like and what my future looks like there, because I told… I met with my boss. [0:01:04] And that went really well. She’s a cool chick. We’ve always gotten along really well on a bunch of different levels. But then I did that, ","P1-N4001F2":"and then I met with my boss’s boss—who I’ve had issues with in the past—on Sunday. And it was different because I could tell, based on what she had said and based on what he had said, he was really doing his best not to come across as desperate. But in his own way he was like, ","P1-N4001F3":"please come back. Please come back and (inaudible at 0:01:33). So that’s… it’s a nice feeling to feel wanted like that, which is good because that’s different than what I left with, right? When I left, I didn’t feel like anyone gave a shit. And it’s good to have that… ","P1-N4001F4":"the tables turned there and feel like, hey, you actually… what you did here was really important. And it took us eight months, but we really do appreciate that a whole lot, and we want you back to do more of that. [0:01:56]
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: And I think that’s more of… that’s the nature of the business, though. Software is a little bit more cyclical than… it’s not like steady state. It’d be like being an accountant around tax time. There’s seven, eight months out of the year where an accountant’s ","P1-N400271":"not slammed. And then there’s probably two or three where they’re totally slammed and then another however many, another two months or so where it’s somewhere in between. Software’s like this. And this being the first release of this size at this company I think is part of what’s ","P1-N400272":"caused a lot of growing pains. For example, from the time that we said… from the time that the CEO said, flip the switch… so the time that we flipped the switch was a matter of minutes. And in that span of time the engineering team changed three quarters of the code that powers the entire ","P1-N400273":"thing. [0:05:56] So lots of things got changed, and no one’s exactly sure what got changed?
THERAPIST: About her (inaudible at 0:11:08)?
CLIENT: The… I mean, I think the relationship. It’s just kind of, eeeeehhh (sp?). Like, yeah, we’re going to Baltimore, that should be fun. But I’m not…I don’t know, it’s like not… I’m not… it’s not even that I’m not excited. It’s ","P1-N400331":"like I’m almost indifferent. You know, like, eeeeehhh (sp?), okay, this is it. And it… and I think it’s just… it’s… I don’t know. I don’t know what causes it, but I think it’s probably a couple of things. First, so she’s unpacking her stuff ","P1-N400332":"at my apartment. She’s like, well, let’s make this the last time. It’s like, okay, yeah, sure. I don’t ever plan on it being… I don’t think about these things like, okay, you’re going to unpack your stuff, and then in two weeks you’re going to have to ","P1-N400333":"pack it back up. But then there’s part of me that’s like…
THERAPIST: Is she moving in?
CLIENT: No, she just put her toiletries and all that. [0:11:57] And it’s like, well, hold on. That really just… that comment rubbed me the wrong way. And then… since then it’s just been like, I don’t know. Like, I don’t about this (chuckling). And it’s weird, ","P1-N400371":"because that comment’s probably in and of itself not that big a deal. But then it’s like, what’s this coming from? I feel like I should be more excited about this person who I’m with and who I think I love. And I’m not. And it’s just like, I don’t know. I was ","P1-N400372":"really glad that I didn’t… like, I got home, and I was like, yeah, I’m going to bed. I’m tired. And she was out with her friends, and I was like, great, I don’t have to talk to her. Like, I was excited about not having to talk to her. And I’m going to Baltimore with ","P1-N400373":"her to meet… to visit some of her friends who just had a baby. And I know them, and they’re cool people. But it’s like, I don’t really want to do this.
THERAPIST: Well, what happens when you’re in it, and what happens when you’re not in it that makes you want to go back to it?
CLIENT: I don’t… well, when I’m in it, it feels really good for a little while. And then it just… it feels like it burns out, and then we kind of just grate on each other? [0:14:03] So it becomes like this tension-filled thing? And then when I’m out of it I don’t ","P1-N4003D1":"know. I don’t know quite what it is that I miss when I’m not in it. I think it’s more I’m lonely than anything. I don’t actually know if it’s that I miss her or if it’s that I just miss having a partner in crime on things (pause), which is probably… yeah, ","P1-N4003D2":"maybe that, because, I mean, it’s shitty. It’s shitty being alone. I’ve been in relationships pretty much my whole life. I was in a nine-year relationship, and then I was single for a while. And then I was with Melanie, and then on and off kind of for the past, I don’t know, ","P1-N4003D3":"six months. And then it’s like, I just… I don’t like feeling lonely at times.
THERAPIST: What would you need to have change for you to want to be… stay in it?
CLIENT: I don’t know. I’d like to see… I’d like to have it feel good, I guess, as ambiguous as that is. The clinginess, it would be nice to not have to deal with that? It’d be nice to be excited to see my girlfriend instead of like, yeah, it’s my girlfriend. [0:21:03] ","P1-N4004B1":"I’d like that, you know? I don’t feel like I have that right now.
THERAPIST: It sounds like soccer. You don’t want to feel obligated to people…
CLIENT: Uh-huh.
THERAPIST: That sort of have these expectations that you be in places that you don’t want to be.
CLIENT: Well, I think the thing about soccer is, it’s a big commitment. And practice, sure, no problem. I mean, when you think about… during the summer… so this is when there’s no soccer, I would play touch soccer twice a week and work out with the team once a week. That’s ","P1-N400531":"three nights a week during the summer when we don’t have soccer. That’s fine, totally happy to make that happen, do that all summer. Come to practice, practice twice a week. Leave work early to go to practice. Miss meetings, reschedule my life around being able to get to these two practices. ","P1-N400532":"And then you’re going to lecture me about how I can’t make it to a banquet when essentially my entire summer, summer tournaments, the whole shebang…? You’re going to give me shit? [0:22:01] Well, what about the guys who weren’t at any of that? Oh, they can make the… ","P1-N400533":"so they’re a better soccer buy because they did that.
THERAPIST: Well, that’s how you described Melanie…
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess so, yeah. You’re smart, (inaudible at 0:2317) you’re good.
THERAPIST: That you fear (crosstalk). The demands placed on you, they just… the ante keeps…
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Once you meet one level, you fear that there’s just going to be another level.
CLIENT: Yeah, well, I think with the soccer thing is… that feels like what it is, right? There’s no effective way to say no. And then it’s like, well, they want me to be the fundraising chair. It’s like, I guess? I mean, no, I don’t really want to do that, but it’s ","P1-N400611":"like, at some point you have to draw the line. And the bitch of it is that I really do enjoy playing soccer. I do, but at some point I need to have a life outside of soccer. [0:23:57] And that’s not… it’s a thing that I do. It’s not who I am. And it’s at the point now where ","P1-N400612":"it’s like I’m scheduling my life around Tuesday, Thursday practice, which is fine. But give me my fucking weekend. My one… (Chuckling) this is my one weekend. But yeah, I think… and maybe I bring that on myself because of who I am?
THERAPIST: What in particular?
CLIENT: The whole… because I was thinking about going to make wine on Saturday morning. And we had talked at one point about going to make wine. And she’s like, well… and that started to be an issue. And she’s like, well, you’ve got to come up to the beach. I was like, ","P1-N400691":"well, I’m going to go make wine, and then we can go up to the beach… I’ll head out to the beach. And she’s like, well, I wanted to do that with you, blah, blah blah. And it was getting really heated. I was like, well, what the fuck? I wanted to have a threesome with you, and ","P1-N400692":"you went off and did that. And it was… and in my mind at that moment they were completely equitable things, going up to Vermont and making wine, her having a threesome. And that was the absolute correct response at the time because… in my mind, right? I want to do this, you want to do that. ","P1-N400693":"I’ve never done this before. I’ve never done that before. You’ve never done either of these things. Things to do together, now we’re going to do them apart. [Fuck off] (ph), you know? And that… I think that that… (Pause) That… I don’t even know if that’s ","P1-N400694":"fair. I don’t know if that’s bad, but it felt really… it felt good to say that and to just let it out. [0:28:04] It was like… I won’t say cathartic because [if it were cathartic] (ph) there’s like that release that comes with it? I don’t know if it was that, ","P1-N400695":"but (pause) it felt… it was just, like, yeah. In my mind these things are equitable, and you fucked that one up, not me. And now… it’s very petty.
THERAPIST: Didn’t take long this time.
CLIENT: No, no, it didn’t. I think… I mean, I feel like it’s… I’m going to give it some time just to see. But to your question, what changes? I don’t know if anything changes. It’s more just for myself to say that I gave it time. Just because I know doesn’t ","P1-N4006F1":"mean that I’m 100% certain. Could go to Baltimore, have a great weekend, and then we kind of come out of that, way up here, and we’re running high. And maybe we can kind of carry that. [0:29:58]
THERAPIST: Well, the issues aren’t going to change though.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean, that’s not going to change, I mean, unless you, I guess, directly address them.
CLIENT: Yeah, well, that’s kind of the same thing she said, so… the therapist. You guys are all on the same wavelength. Well, she was like… I mean, she just… she made the same point. She was like… I’m looking forward to going to Baltimore, she’s looking forward ","P1-N400771":"to going to Baltimore. It’s going… it’ll be… I’m sure it’ll be a great vacation. But then it’s like… but then what? Nothing has changed, right, between us. It’s still the same thing. So what then? Do we just try to muscle through it? I don’t ","P1-N400772":"know. I can even… I wish I could at least quantify the issues that… so you could talk through them, like, okay, great. She’s clingy. I definitely need more space than she does. She’s probably more social than I am. She thinks I’m immature. I think she’s kind of a ","P1-N400773":"stiff. I’m certainly… I’m… I know I can be a pain in the ass sometimes and, yeah, immature in some regards? [0:31:04] Yeah, absolutely. But…
THERAPIST: How does…? Do you know what she means by that?
CLIENT: Well, just the whole drinking thing. She thinks that’s really immature. She thinks that my friends are immature. I don’t… in her mind adult life is having a dinner party. And I totally love to do that. I live in a studio. My apartment’s smaller than this room. I could ","P1-N4007B1":"fit four people in there, maybe, comfortably, and certainly not for dinner. So it’s like, I can’t do those sorts of things. Having a fast car, I’ve always had fast cars. I’m never not going to have fast cars. That to her is immature. It’s like, well, why don’t you ","P1-N4007B2":"just get something boring and adult-like, like a Toyota Camry because it’s reliable? And it’s like, well, because I don’t want a Toyota Camry, and I can buy whatever car I want because it’s my money. [0:31:55] So don’t try to weigh in on those things? You know, like that. ","P1-N4007B3":"I’m trying to think of what else. Like, I like to play video games sometimes. And it’s not like I play video games addictively, but sometimes a new video game’ll come out, I’ll play it for a while. Maybe the new Grand Theft Auto when that comes out I’ll get it and play ","P1-N4007B4":"it. Well, that’s immature.
THERAPIST: So you don’t feel she’s accepting of you. She can be judgmental?
CLIENT: I’ve told her before… the way that I say that is, it’s like you don’t get me. Like, I like… and this is another thing. And I’ve never really known how much weight to put on it, and I don’t know if I ever will. I suppose I’ll know when I know. But ","P1-N4007F1":"her interests and my interests are very… there’s very little overlap in the Venn diagram, right? She likes to read People magazine and watch sort of mindless TV. I like… or doesn’t care… she doesn’t care about science fiction, or she has trouble… she falls asleep ","P1-N4007F2":"all the time at movies. [That was always something] (ph), like, I love to watch movies, all different kinds, not only science fiction. [0:32:56] I love Star Wars, Game of Thrones, all of that. I read like a… I mean, I make it through Jared Diamond. So that’s not exactly an easy task for ","P1-N4007F3":"everyone. And it’s like… that’s like… I love that, and I feel like that’s part of how… I mean, we talked a little bit about wanderlust. That’s part of how I satiate that, right? You just… you could read a book and go somewhere else. You can do something ","P1-N4007F4":"else, you can learn about something else. And you don’t actually have to leave anywhere. And that’s why I love books. I’m just a voracious reader. Her, not so much. I bought her a couple books, never anything.
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like it’s sort of a theme, you think she needs too much.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, no, that’s a good… but, now, I’m wondering, am I putting that on myself? [0:38:00] Or is that coming from her? Or is it a combination thereof? Because I could see… I can see where… from… for her, I’m the anomalous thing in her life, right? ","P1-N4008B1":"If you look at relationship history in men, it’s been bad relationships across the board. And I’ve been fortunate. All my girlfriends, it’s been good until it wasn’t good any more, but then we kind of went our separate ways, and that was that. With… but with her, she’s ","P1-N4008B2":"never had a guy that treated her really well or… whatever I’ve done I think I treat her well. But she’s never had a guy like this before, and I think she’s simultaneously afraid to lose it, but at the same point she wants to lock it down quickly because she’s older. So ","P1-N4008B3":"biological clock is ticking. But that also could be me projecting that onto her because that’s, I don’t know, what I want to see. [0:38:56] But she certainly isn’t… one of my buddies, he’s 25. He dates a 37-year-old. And she’s just totally chill, super mellow every ","P1-N4008B4":"time she’s out with us. It’s no big deal if we’re drinking out of… whatever we’re drinking out of, it’s not an issue. There’s no snide comments or anything like that. And I’m sure he doesn’t bitch at her, or she doesn’t bitch at him once they’re ","P1-N4008B5":"away from everybody else about how that was… she seems like she legitimately has a good time.
THERAPIST: Make yourself feel better because otherwise you’d feel bad?
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it’s shitty no matter what. But doing… I’ve done this to her… like, last time we broke up was on her birthday. And that was… we were supposed to go to San Diego the following week. We were supposed to actually go to San Diego. Her birthday was the ","P1-N400931":"beginning of June, and the next week in June… or we’d had dinner for her birthday the third or second week of June? And her birthday was on a Wednesday, and the following Tuesday we were supposed to go to San Diego. [0:43:00] It was like, you’re not going to San Diego. Get the hell ","P1-N400932":"out of my apartment, kind of thing. And that… I mean, that pissed her off a lot because she’s like, what the…? Really? I was like, yeah, really. Go (chuckling). (Pause) But I would feel really shitty doing that again. I mean, I feel shitty enough having to do this, but doing it before ","P1-N400933":"we go on a trip again is probably… that’s a new level of dickishness. I can tolerate a trip to Baltimore. I have fun in Baltimore. And we’ll have… like I said, we’ll have a good time while we’re there. And then coming back we can see how it is, and it will feel the ","P1-N400934":"same, and then I’ll know. I’ll know then that it’s okay, time to call it and just go from there. (Pause) But yeah, just doing it before would just be… that would be bad. I would not feel good about myself. I would feel really bad about myself and what I did. [0:44:01] Because ","P1-N400935":"I know that that would… it’s just not… to do that once to somebody’s pretty low. But to do it again is pretty fucking bad, I think. She’s booked this trip to Baltimore. Her friends are excited to see us. Let’s just go through with it.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you’re talking yourself into (ph) something.
CLIENT: Yeah, probably. I mean, it’s… I just… I can’t… (Pause) I’m not heartless enough to do it before we leave, you know? That just doesn’t… and I need the vacation. There’s that, too. That’s probably a big chunk of it. (Pause) Yeah. I should ","P1-N400971":"have known better this time. I should have. It’s actually absurd to think about this, because I think about other people who… you know, you’re on the outside of this, and you’re looking at it. [0:45:00] And you go, what the hell are they doing? Any… I look at my friends ","P1-N400972":"who’ve broken up and got back together, and you’re like, why are you doing that? You have so many other… (Yawning) excuse me… so many other people out there. What are you doing? And they kind of keep doing this, and then eventually there’s something that finally pssssshhh ","P1-N400973":"(sp?). And I feel like I’m not one of those people for the first time. It’s [not like] (ph), coming back, coming back (inaudible at 0:45:24). At some point I imagine we’ll eventually hit the psssshhh (sp?) inflection (ph) point and kind of go our separate way.
THERAPIST: Well, I look forward to continuing to talk about it next week.
CLIENT: (Chuckling) Yeah, oh yeah.
THERAPIST: We do need to stop. So next week was the one time that I have this time booked…
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I think I had mentioned that a month ago.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So just for next week, I have… I could do… what is this, three…? I have a 2:50 time.
CLIENT: Let me check my…
THERAPIST: Will you be able to do that?
CLIENT: Let me check my calendar, what it looks like.
THERAPIST: Okay. And it’s just for next week, otherwise…
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, I got this one on my calendar as a recurring… day… week… (Pause) [0:46:05] Hmm. (Pause) 2:50? Yeah, I can do 2:50 next week.
THERAPIST: Oh, great. Okay, so I’ll put you in for 2:50 for next week, and then we’ll go back to 3:40.
CLIENT: Yeah, sounds good.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Two… I’m just putting it on there.
THERAPIST: Sure. (Pause)
CLIENT: That will actually work out well (ph). Cool, thank you.
THERAPIST: Great.
CLIENT: For this event only. Right. Cool, we’re in there.
THERAPIST: Okay, very good.
CLIENT: All right, awesome. Thank you so much.
THERAPIST: So I’ll see you next week, okay. Take care.
CLIENT: Yeah, thank you. (Pause) Have a good one.
THERAPIST: Okay, bye bye.
