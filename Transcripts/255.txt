TITLE: Client "S" Therapy Session Audio Recording, November 02, 2012: Client is doing better with her schooling and passion, but is still confused over her current relationship.
DESCRIPTION: Client is doing better with her schooling and passion, but is still confused over her current relationship.
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in.
CLIENT: Hi. (pause) [00:03:00] It's hot and cold. (chuckling) (pause) OK, so last time I was thinking. So you very nicely described what happiness will mean... should mean to me. [00:04:03] I was just wondering, can I be happy if I don't become successful? If I don't... yea. I don't think so.
THERAPIST: I'm sorry?
CLIENT: I don't think so is my answer. Yea. (chuckling) (pause) I have compromised enough like lowered my expectations since last year and stuff but... and I... but recently in my workshop, I submitted some work and my professor, she really loved it and encouraged me to revise it. [00:05:14]
THERAPIST: (sneezes) Excuse me.
CLIENT: Oh, bless you. [00:09:02]
THERAPIST: Thanks.
CLIENT: If I could derive my self-worth from something. A place other than my passion but I cannot. It's all I have. I mean, I couldn't say, "Oh, it's good that I'm a nice person most of the time. I'm sensitive and..." But that doesn't add up my ambition. (pause) [00:10:00] I guess I'm trying to learn ","P1-N400231":"what he tried to teach me or tried to explain to tell me. But I'm not sure how to... I'm not willing to give up my neurosis that produces the ambition and the drive to achieve that ambition. But I also don't want to kill myself being in pursuit of that.
THERAPIST: Do you work a lot now?
CLIENT: Yea. Way more than I was but I didn't much in the summer when I was in Nepal. And then when I came back, I was crazy busy with the job. [00:11:01] So I didn't. So now, yea, because I have deadlines and my own... I'd like to finish my own project. So...
THERAPIST: Do you feel that ambition only comes from neurosis?
CLIENT: No. I don't know. It was just something he and I were talking about. I think it was his words that neurotic people are the ones who actually do something when he said that. Like when I said, "Do you..." This is weird. He saw our relation was bad. He wanted to make sure that I wasn't falling ","P1-N4002B1":"for him and I wanted to tell him, "Look, I'm not because I see your negative points which were A, you're not ambitious; and B, you live in Cheshire." (chuckling) And he said that (inaudible at 00:11:52) that neurotic people who are ambitious. [00:12:02] But what did you mean by that ambition only comes from...
THERAPIST: I wasn't sure if that's what you were saying. I didn't know if you were saying, "Well, but if I feel better about myself, I'm not going to be ambitious because..."
CLIENT: Perhaps, yea. Actually, yea.
THERAPIST: That's what I was wondering...
CLIENT: Yea.
THERAPIST: ...when you were saying that.
CLIENT: Yea. It feels... I do use that and abuse it, I guess, also. (chuckling) If I feel very good about the comments, right? I mean, that's exactly what happened (inaudible at 00:12:42). I really don't want that to happen ever again. It was horrible. All that thing... all that... all the prizes and ","P1-N400371":"the praises of these eminent artists went straight to my head. [00:13:00]
THERAPIST: I'm more curious about how you're thinking about it.
CLIENT: Yea. So did I do a good job explaining? (chuckling)
THERAPIST: Do you think you're seeking my approval?
CLIENT: I just feel a little lost without road marks or something. (chuckling) So I see your comments as helping me along.
THERAPIST: A way to orient you?
CLIENT: Yea. [00:17:01] But yea, definitely approval would be nice. I don't know why approval. (chuckling)
THERAPIST: Well, in a sense I hope to give you something better than that which is sort of understanding what all these things mean to you.
CLIENT: That would be very nice.
THERAPIST: At least different. I certainly don't want to communicate I don't approve of you but different maybe and hopefully better.
CLIENT: That would be nice. (pause)
THERAPIST: And to help you sort of know your experience more and feel confident that that can guide you.
CLIENT: Yea. (pause)
THERAPIST: Like when you ask whether... what did you... you asked if something would make you happy and then, "Am I miserable for this reason?"
CLIENT: Yes. [00:18:01]
THERAPIST: You're a better... you're an expert on your experience in a way that I can't be.
CLIENT: Yea. (pause) Yea. These... I still don't trust my judgment, I guess, with myself because it can be harsh and unrealistic and stuff. So... (pause) I guess my question was more about like I want to be happy. (chuckling) And I wonder if having contingencies in happiness is not a good idea, et cetera. ","P1-N4005D1":"(pause) And that's all. And I know I am... from past experience, I feel like I know that success is a contingency for happiness for me. [00:19:02]
THERAPIST: (phone ringing) Sorry about that. (pause)
CLIENT: Yea, because I feel not being generous makes my life very difficult. [00:23:02] Like this normally concern that I've taken this apartment that... and I'm not even living there. So like three, four days a week, I'm here at Chris's (sp?). I feel really bad about wasting that money. And then I ","P1-N400631":"feel bad that I failed at living by myself but not... I don't know if that's... because I'm fine if I'm there. And I'm fine. I can work or be by myself. It's not that I don't... that I hate being by myself. It's just like sometimes the idea frightens me or I like the square so much or the thought of ","P1-N400632":"Arlington makes me sad. (chuckling) [00:24:08] (pause)
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: Because everything is there. He loves me, check. He's got a good job, check. (chuckling) He wants me in his life, check. (chuckling) We've been together for so long, check. (chuckling)
THERAPIST: You're worried that you'll have a more constricted life with him and then it'll be too constrictive. It's both organizing and structuring on the positive side. But the flip side of that is you feel like it's too structured and too limiting.
CLIENT: Yea. I don't know. It just feels... I mean, it's not as bad as it was when I was breaking up with my first boyfriend but... yea. But it's terrible. This is not terrible. [00:29:02] But I'm afraid that terrible. I'm afraid that this might turn into that. But I don't know. I'm so confused. (pause) ","P1-N400731":"I don't know what I want. (pause) And right now we see each other and I try to make it fun. And then tell myself, "This is fun. This is fun. This is fun. This is fun." And then at some point, I do start getting engaged. That word that is so important to me. It's something he's saying and then I forget ","P1-N400732":"that I'm saying, telling myself this is fun. (chuckling) But then yea, I pop right back because, again, he's very cerebral and he's maybe telling me that there is... like (inaudible at 00:29:57), "There's no difference between the bourgeoisie and the capitalist."
THERAPIST: You mention taking advantage of in a couple of ways. [00:34:08] You were worrying about taking advantage of him. Your feelings, at least in the past, that he was taking advantage of you.
CLIENT: Yea. (pause) I don't... a part of it... I just... like say the... yea, I mean, what I said, right, that I had to work and I felt that if I didn't have to work if I didn't have to support my mom and him I would have been able to focus on my passion. So I was mad at him that he wasn't more... ","P1-N4007F1":"that he didn't take sort of the steps to make sure he would be able to pay his share of the rent throughout. [00:35:05]
THERAPIST: Yea, I was going to ask you what led you to do that.
CLIENT: Yea. Just feel like emotion... not I don't have any feelings of love and tenderness but just feeling very unconfident about my work because at that time I didn't really know what I was doing and what I wanted to work on. But now it's a bit more concrete. I mean, at least the work is concrete. ","P1-N400871":"So I don't know if my confidence has increased or not. (chuckling) Probably not but at least I know what I'm doing so that makes it a little easier to have boundaries. (pause) [00:38:00] But yea, going forward I don't know. I feel like there's every danger of me turning to it again and not... if I don't ","P1-N400872":"have something concrete that I'm working on.
THERAPIST: [Too much?] (ph)
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: Something without any structure.
CLIENT: Something without a backbone. (chuckling) And you can imagine how awful that feeling must be being next to someone who's all structure, right? (chuckling) Who's like I don't know with the whole structure thing plant cell or cells. (chuckling) And he just being... I don't know. A whole ","P1-N4008F1":"bunch amoeba although they are cells, too. (chuckling) (pause) [00:39:00]
THERAPIST: Well, it's not only about him and your long relationship with him and his... your investment in him. But it's like, what kind of life you want to live? What values do you want to live by? What are the pros and cons of each?
CLIENT: Yea, exactly, yea. And what I can do for myself and what I cannot. (pause)
THERAPIST: It seems like you associate him with a proper kind of life. This is the life you should lead. It's proper. It's morally sound.
CLIENT: Yea.
THERAPIST: It's respectable.
CLIENT: Yea, absolutely, yea.
THERAPIST: And then there's a life that you imagine that's expansive and more exciting.
CLIENT: Yea. But also perhaps obscure and I should say that it has its bonds (ph) that are not very attractive to me at all. [00:41:08]
THERAPIST: Like what?
CLIENT: Like he doesn't... Victor (sp?) doesn't go out. He's like a caveman. (chuckling) He doesn't... like with Chris (sp?), I mean, that even just this week we had like social events three times and two very significant ones. Our very good friend just published her book and we were at the book launch ","P1-N400A51":"and all the people I like were there. These are young professors at Brown, Yale and all of that. That, for me, is glamour. That, for me, is like... that's important. That's the life I want to live. [00:42:02] I want to be at book launches and I want to be... yea. But that kind of a thing, I don't know ","P1-N400A52":"if Victor (sp?) doesn't do that.
THERAPIST: It's so interesting when I said like that part of you really wants to live in an expansive, exciting life. And you think, oh, well that's Victor (sp?).
CLIENT: Yea. (chuckling)
THERAPIST: And then he doesn't go out. He's a caveman which actually doesn't really sound like an expansive, exciting life at all.
CLIENT: (chuckling) Well, in his mind I feel like he is expansive. Like...
THERAPIST: Lots of people feel certain ways about themselves. That doesn't mean you have to agree. I'm not saying there aren't ways in which he... there certainly seems like there are ways in which he's expansive. Probably more so there are ways in which you get in touch with your more expansive side with him.
CLIENT: Yea. [00:43:02]
THERAPIST: But you see these as such separate worlds.
CLIENT: Yea. I mean, is it expansive to be at a book launch? Is that what you're saying?
THERAPIST: I actually was commenting on this. It sounds like you felt that way.
CLIENT: Well, not expansive. Because then again I should say I associate that word with Victor (sp?). (chuckling) I just felt like what I'm saying that was that would be lacking unless I drag him to such things. Yea. But I don't know. Can I live without them? Maybe.
THERAPIST: I just don't understand how you associate like someone who's imagining more exciting and expansive who wouldn't want to go to book launches.
CLIENT: Yea. But there's like... like one time... like the first... after the first time we were together, he said...
THERAPIST: But I'm not talking about him. [00:44:03] Victor (sp?) probably wouldn't but he's not the only person in the world who could offer you something like that.
CLIENT: But that's the only person I know. How can I say this man out there who I might meet, if he's expansive, he would do X? I mean is that how I should think?
THERAPIST: Well, it just... I don't know. But the way you're thinking about it is very concrete. And your mind is not simply concrete.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Like you're associating here are the attributes. Here's a person who has these attributes. So everything he is, is associated.
CLIENT: Yea, I have very strong associations.
THERAPIST: An exciting person doesn't go to book clubs because or book launches, I put clubs, sorry, book launches because Victor (sp?) doesn't do that.
CLIENT: No, no, no. That's not what I mean. No, no, no. [00:45:02] Is that... I think I might have not communicated properly. I meant to say that... so he brings certain... he has certain qualities and Chris (sp?) has certain... not qualities but because of being with him, I do these things. And book ","P1-N400CD1":"launches would not come under this column.
THERAPIST: Well, that's why, I guess, I'm questioning.
CLIENT: Well, they might. Yea, they might. I mean, they could. (chuckling) I am confused though. I'm really confused. I just meant that giving up Chris (sp?) might mean giving these things up. Giving up book launches, giving up being seen in our little community. (chuckling) And I'm beginning to see ","P1-N400D11":"it's a really small community and some people know everyone so... not everyone knows everyone. [00:46:04] But there are a lot of people who know everyone. And breaking up with Chris (sp?) and going out with someone else in the community would not be... (chuckling) I really couldn't do that. (pause)
THERAPIST: So we're going to need to stop for today. I'll see you on Monday.
CLIENT: All right.
THERAPIST: OK?
CLIENT: 10:15.
THERAPIST: 10:15 Monday, exactly. OK. Have a good weekend, OK?
CLIENT: You too.
THERAPIST: Take care.
CLIENT: Bye.
