TITLE: Client "D" Therapy Session Audio Recording, March 25, 2014: Client attributes her recent feelings of lowness and tiredness to her menstrual cycle.
DESCRIPTION: Client attributes her recent feelings of lowness and tiredness to her menstrual cycle.
THERAPIST: By appointment right now.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in. I got your message.
CLIENT: Sorry, I was (inaudible at 00:06:13) on the way here.
THERAPIST: I’m sorry?
CLIENT: I was just delayed on the way. (pause) I guess on the way, like I was just thinking I was talking about how I’m so I got my period yesterday and I realized that for a few years beforehand I’ve been feeling unusually low; just unhappy. [00:07:27]
THERAPIST: Feel free to tell me whatever you need to tell me.
CLIENT: Sorry, I know it’s just me. I hate bodily fluid stuff. But I’ve always had really, really heavy periods when I was a kid and very painful. And I don’t really know why it took so long to realize that I just had to take the doctor’s advice and go on the pill. [00:15:21]
THERAPIST: Beforehand and dating to?
CLIENT: High school. It was (pause) I can’t remember whether it was grade 11 or 12, but I went on the pill in the first place, and I was very nervous about it. I’m not really sure what I thought would happen, but I think it was because it was a birth control pill and I thought that somehow ","P1-N4004D1":"it meant that I was somehow having sex even when I didn’t have a boyfriend or anything, right. [Laughing]
THERAPIST: In the end.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: At the epilogue?
CLIENT: [Crying] I was sort of just remembering about that e-mail and I was laughing and (inaudible at 00:25:46) about how can I can I write something bad and turn to Page 8? [Laughing] What am I supposed to do here? (pause)
THERAPIST: I mean I don’t know much about the (inaudible at 00:27:27) of these things. Do you know when your period comes back again if there’s sort of a hormonal surge or some sort of hormonal shift? I would imagine there is.
CLIENT: I think there is. I know so little about it. I’m not as bad as a bunch would probably know more actually about the science behind it since that’s what my husband does right now because I know as much about science as about that.
THERAPIST: I guess I’m saying that in part because I don’t want you to be alarmed. It sounds like you’re like oh, my gosh, I feel like my personality has changed overnight and not for the better. And I sort of you know clearly forgetting your period back there is some sort of emotion. ","P1-N400751":"I really don’t know much about it.
CLIENT: Yes, that’s why I’ve been sort of (pause) you know on the one hand I’ve been trying to tell myself that like it’s (pause) I don’t know if it’s just taking something to control the hormones, also control that, then that’s probably what’s going on. [00:29:20]
THERAPIST: Well it’s not like you’re looking at it too much it’s that you’re worrying. You’re very worried.
CLIENT: Yes. It’s like part of it is, is it me or is it just like, you know, when you pick back the scab that’s what’s really there, or something like that. [00:30:08]
THERAPIST: You do have this fear that, you know, pulling back a few layers and there’s going to be like there’s this crazy person there.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)
THERAPIST: And when you’re not feeling good or right it’s like you’re just that feeling intensifies.
CLIENT: Yeah. I was reading (pause) and I don’t get a chance, it’s funny, I guess I’m an academic who reads. I don’t get a chance to read very much. But (pause) it’s a very few people I read who write today. One mostly writes in the niche field of knitting humor, but she ","P1-N400871":"just came out with a book that only mentions knitting a few times instead of being knitting. [00:31:23]
THERAPIST: Where’d you go?
CLIENT: I was just thinking about how (pause) I was just sort of trailing through other times when I’ve been either (pause) some kind of (pause) mostly I was thinking about when I gave birth to Genevieve how (pause) after that when I was staying and I was so (pause) I guess in a way I’m ","P1-N400931":"sort of still puzzling over how I didn’t react to it at the time. How I didn’t do anything about it. [00:37:00]
THERAPIST: Well the problem for you sometime is the conclusions that you draw from the feelings you’re having like oh, I must be crazy. The one like Kathleen, the one like Laura; that you don’t allow yourself the feels that you start to judge them and put them in categories, and usually ","P1-N400A51":"not very favorable ones at that. [00:43:09]
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) You know it reminds of (pause) I was with her once in the grocery store and she was acting sort of very chipper. And she asked me, am I acting unnaturally chipper, because I’m trying to make because I don’t feel happy and I’m trying to make myself be happy ","P1-N400A71":"by acting happy.
THERAPIST: Well that’s not a good way to think.
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Where do you think the two of you get that from; those thoughts?
CLIENT: (pause) I don’t know. I think wanting to send them to me and I think I kind of get it from Leah because we’re definitely I mean I definitely (pause) have we’re very close to stressing she’s definitely more active of the two of us.
THERAPIST: Dominant. [00:46:00]
CLIENT: Dominant [Laughing]. And I talked a lot about everything and, you know, so (pause) I’ve always had lots of (pause) I mean thinking just very recently, before we had our kids, she all of a sudden felt like she I think it’s a very common and I’ve noticed it in a lot of my ","P1-N400B71":"friends. You know I’ve been meeting for ages.
THERAPIST: Pressure.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Typical. No need to apologize. No need to apologize. You did nothing wrong.
CLIENT: I don’t know whether it’s the American thing or is that the whatever, but I think yes, I know I need to (pause) sorry.
THERAPIST: That’s okay. It’s okay. We’re going to be okay. You’re having a tough day. You’re having a tough week. I imagine there’s something hormonal. And like I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I might Google it and find out when you get your period ","P1-N400C51":"back after, you know, being pregnant, whether there’s I can’t imagine there’s not a shift in hormones. [00:48:02]
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Take care.
