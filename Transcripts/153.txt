DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her desire to progress in her relationship and life, but is not sure if her boyfriend is the best fit for her. Client is tired of his laziness and wish he would be willing to be more assertive for her and their relationship.
THERAPIST: Hi.
CLIENT: I know where to start.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: [Theoretic?]. But I think I-it's less stress this week, even though all our company didn't get paid. Seven hundred people in my facility didn't get paid our paychecks the other week. And everybody else has gotten paid, but my check for some reason has not gone through. I got paid half. So I'm ","P1-N400131":"still working on that. But normally I'd be really stressed out about that, but it hasn't really bothered me as much. I got a convenience check from like the government, and then they after that sent me like information saying that I owed them. Like I had a debt with the government again, and it was ","P1-N400132":"like a threatening letter. It's frustrating, but I'm like used to it by now, the way they treat their employees. So that was going on this week. Hopefully I get paid not like in a huge sum of money where they take all the taxes out. I'm hoping I can get paid before I get my real check this week. So ","P1-N400133":"that's frustrating. [4:00]
THERAPIST: Do you feel calmer?
CLIENT: Yeah. I went and I saw the therapist, and like everything that I was so dramatic about has been better, a lot better. It's like the Prozac kinda kicked in like two weeks after she prescribed it. [6:00]
THERAPIST: Oh, so you saw Dr. Levin recently?
CLIENT: Yeah, I saw her on Thursday. I won't have to see her for like six more months. And I take the Klonopin supplement at night. Like I'm kinda now being able to sleep without like nightmares, which is nice. But I still like get really emotional with my period. And it was supposed to help with that, ","P1-N4001D1":"but it doesn't. Like I'm just, you know, irritable and like emotional the night before I get it, and everything is just really dramatic for me. I like pick fights with Steve when I have it, like right before my period.
THERAPIST: What is it like spending time with this guy? [8:00]
CLIENT: He helps me in school. He kind of like can relate to the fact that I feel bad at school because he's, you know, veered off in a couple directions. And we talk about our relationships, he talks about his relationship, I talk about my relationship. I kind of get the other side of things, you know. ","P1-N400231":"Like he talks about some relationship he's in, and this girl is very like emotional, and he's told her that like it's not going to last, like we're just-this is just for right now. And he's been very honest with her, and she gets upset. And I tell him that like you can't do that. Like she-if you're ","P1-N400232":"treating her like you're her boyfriend and you're doing things that like a boyfriend would do instead of like it just being a physical relationship you're leading her on.
THERAPIST: Do you feel differently about Steve?
CLIENT: Do I?
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: I did for like a day. But since he's like been, you know, he's been doing really nice things, and-like he-the other day like I was like, "Can you please pick me up some tampons?" and he said no. And I asked him again, I was like, "Will you please pick me up some tampons, I forgot again," and ","P1-N4002D1":"he actually did it. And I was like, wow, that took a moment to do that, I give him credit for trying. And he was like, the first time he said he thought I was just trying to like prove something. Which I wasn't. He thought I was just trying to like dig at him and pick a fight. And I was like, "No, I ","P1-N4002D2":"was just asking you to do me a favor, because I would do that for you." But like this morning after we had like our tiff, I went out and I like fished with him, and he was like very affectionate and very like responsive to the fact that I was like doing something he liked to do. So. [10:45]
THERAPIST: And how do you feel he's reacting to it? [12:00]
CLIENT: I don't know. I think he's like giving a little more. Like he's more affectionate, and he's more like trying to like speak with me about stuff when I have things to talk about. It's still like the same thing though. Like he's tired, it's late. It stinks, he works six out of the seven days. But ","P1-N400331":"I want more from him. And I told him, if he can't give me more then like this is never going to work. He thinks I'm rubbing it in his face. Instead of like taking it as like honesty, he thinks I'm rubbing it in his face.
THERAPIST: Rubbing what?
CLIENT: The fact that like if things don't change I'm going to leave. He thinks I'm rubbing it in his face. Which is not-I don't know, I don't feel like I'm doing that. I'm just being honest.
THERAPIST: Do you think he feels worried?
CLIENT: No. I don't think much worries him.
THERAPIST: Hm. You don't think he's worried about your leaving?
CLIENT: No. He's told me that. He said that he thinks that I would never leave him pretty much, he has no fear of that. I'm like, okay. And he thinks like if we argue-like it seems like we do this-like we use this "I'm going to leave you" to kind of control the other one to like be the way we want them ","P1-N4003F1":"to. But I'm not doing that anymore. Like I'm very honest about I will leave you. And that's fine, I have a place to go. Like I will pay for the rent or whatever until like our lease is up, but I don't have to live with him. You know.
THERAPIST: You don't. [14:30]
CLIENT: Yeah, that feels good. Yeah. I don't know, we'll see if that worries him or not. I've seen a change this week, that's all. I want-I told him like I'm going to look into like what they have for like GED classes like at night or after school, you know, so he can kind of feel better about himself, ","P1-N400431":"like he's making a difference. And he thinks he can't be-he can't do that. But with his schedule he's like-he could do that, he could do a morning class, or he could do an evening class.
THERAPIST: When does he work, from when to when?
CLIENT: It's all different. That's why I think he could schedule around it if he really wanted to tell his like manager like, "I have classes today so you're going to have to schedule me at night." Or, "I have class this night, schedule me in the morning." I'm sure they'll do that. I mean, he has an ","P1-N400471":"educate-he dropped out his senior year. Like he has education up to his senior year, it shouldn't be that difficult. So. His mother has tried, she's tried to pay for classes, and he hasn't gone through with it. I don't know. We'll see. I still have some sort of hope. I'm just taking it-instead of like-I ","P1-N400472":"think it's like when I feel like we're doing good it's like, "Oh, this is great, it's gonna work." But it's not going to be good every day, and I'm not going to get overly excited then overly disappointed if things aren't going the right way. So. [16:30]
THERAPIST: Sort of my floating thought is, well, there's always some time for fun.
CLIENT: I guess. I don't know, I'm just not that type of person that like goes out to like clubs. Like I'll go to the bar with like a girlfriend, but I don't go out out.
THERAPIST: Well, I'm not suggesting you should go out out, I'm just more, you know, questioning the idea of you can't-you don't have time to have fun.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I've been having a little more fun than I have had all year. Like on Halloween I went out with two of my friends at separate times, that was fun. And like just being more social is fun for me, without him. I used to bring him along, and now like he even says he wants to hang out ","P1-N400511":"with some of his guy friends and stuff. And he told me he felt like he couldn't do that. And I said to him, "I've never in my life like told you you could not hang out with your friends." I was like, "I've been pushing you to go out, so you can't blame that on me." I'm like, that's ridiculous for him ","P1-N400512":"to say that. Like he's trying to blame things on me I feel like. So I don't know. I'm like, "If I can go out with people so can you." [19:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah, did you ask her?
CLIENT: She said since like I'm going to therapy that I should be able to work out. That like I'm just going through a depression and that I should be able to like function without it. I was like, I don't know.
THERAPIST: It sounds like they confused you.
CLIENT: Yeah. Since I see like people on medication for like depression for the rest of their life.
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like she felt that something could get better in terms of how you feel about yourself and feel about your life circumstances such that the medication might not be needed. Does that seem possible? [20:00]
CLIENT: Yeah, but I think I'm like-well, I have like anxiety like naturally, I have generalized anxiety. It gets worse because of my circumstances, but I've had it my whole life, like since I was a little kid. So I don't know how that gets better, I guess with like control, or other coping mechanisms. ","P1-N4005F1":"Which I did. And I think like I didn't learn the right coping mechanisms, I don't know, to deal with it. So.
THERAPIST: Well, I'll certainly touch base with you-with her I mean. You know, I'm sympathetic to what you're saying then, to some things are more kind of ingrained, environment that got deeply ingrained, or just your biology or genetics that got ingrained. So it seems reasonable that you think that ","P1-N400611":"you'd be on it for more than a year. I'd like to contact her and, you know, get her thinking about it.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it gives me hope. Like that's nice, like if I ever wanted to have a child I don't-you know, be on medication and trying to get pregnant.
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: Because there's, you know, there's side effects to that, you know. Or she even said it herself.
THERAPIST: Yeah. They're pretty-they're class C.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Paxil isn't, but the other ones are class C.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: There's not really been that much determined about birth defects. There's been very low correlation. Almost everything's class C these days.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: In Europe most of the registries have found no-sometimes in the U.S. the registries have found some low correlation, but they haven't been replicated in any other country. So-
CLIENT: She actually agreed I think though. [22:00]
THERAPIST: Sorry?
CLIENT: She actually agreed with me, that she wouldn't want me on.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, different people feel differently, it's a very controversial area.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But, I mean, thousands and thousands of women are on anti-depressants when they're pregnant.
CLIENT: Oh really?
THERAPIST: Oh yeah. It's very common. You know, the thought is if you absolutely can do without it fine, but if it's important for your health, if you're at all unstable, that's a much greater risk to the child than the medication.
CLIENT: Right. That's what I meant. Like the hormones alone that would just be very difficult.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I know that like my sister in law, I think she's suffering from post-partum right now, and the doctor gave her something but she's not taking it. So I'm just trying to watch her. She never really wanted-she told me she never wanted to get pregnant. She didn't think she was going to get pregnant. ","P1-N4008F1":"She told my brother yes, but really didn't think she was going to get pregnant anyway. And I was like, "Oh, that's great." Like that poor kid. So he's like already-like they're planning daycare, they're planning like-she wants to go back to work. She's already like throwing the baby to like my mother ","P1-N4008F2":"and stuff. So like my brother, she really doesn't want her-she wants to have a social life and then go back to work. I'm like, oh, that's really sad. And my god, if that was my kid, you know, that's what I want, is to like have a family and have a kid.
THERAPIST: And you feel like she's abandoning her kid?
CLIENT: I don't know. That's what my mother says, that's what she sees. And that's what like her-she has a sister that lives there for now, that's what the sister's saying, that she'll like go and sleep and give the kid to my brother after he gets home from work, and be like, "All right, he's yours ","P1-N400931":"now." And that's what she joked about, she joked about it, like she was just the incubator when she gave my brother a child. I was like, "You really need to take it seriously." Hopefully she'll be able to fall into it when like he's a little older. But doesn't that-the bonding start like right when they're infants?
THERAPIST: Yes. Yeah.
CLIENT: Is that really crucial? Like-
THERAPIST: Who knows.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It's impossible to study it, you'd have to have cameras in all women's-and maybe, you know, a sample size of thousands of people who would have to be willing to have cameras to observe them, and you can't possibly know. [25:00]
CLIENT: I just remember like in psychology that I studied that, that like you really have to bond when you're an infant. I don't know. Just like the different fundamentals. And then like self-soothing. Like they don't want him like to cry. Like he's always like there and she's not, and they can't sleep ","P1-N4009F1":"so they won't put the baby down to try to self-sooth himself. So they never get sleep. Any time they put the baby-put him down he'll start screaming. So I'm like, that would be frustrating.
THERAPIST: Frustrating for?
CLIENT: The mother. And the child then really. He never is calm, it's just crying and [groggy? 25:52] all the time.
THERAPIST: Mm, hm mm. [26:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. So they're both exhausted. And you know, they're going to do daycare for a little bit, but I think like me and my mother are going to start babysitting for him. So that will be fun.
THERAPIST: I'm wondering-I was thinking about your mind going to babies.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And mothering.
CLIENT: Yeah, I've wanted a kid for a while.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: But it's definitely not the right time.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: For me and Steve. And I just thought like I'd have a life together by now. So that's frustrating. But I'll get there. I think Steve would be a good father. So that's a plus. And he thinks he'd be a good father too. And he's-we talk about children. But he wants to like establish himself before ","P1-N400B71":"that. And I don't think he'd ever like establish himself like within four years. So that's like one thing that makes me like upset about the relationship. You know. [pause] [fighting tears] Part of me is like torn. Because I feel like if me and Steve broke up, it like took me forever to get over my ","P1-N400B72":"ex before him. Like I get so attached. Like I felt like I couldn't date for a long time. And I'm almost 30. And I want to be able to have like a family and children, and I just feel like that's impossible.
THERAPIST: Do you worry about time passing? [28:50]
CLIENT: I'm trying not to anymore. I know like-I think all women think about that. Like my best friend thinks about that. She says, "Why are you wasting your time if you're not happy?" And like, "We're not getting any younger." I'm like, "I don't know." She's wasting her time too in her relationship. ","P1-N400BB1":"I'm just trying to tell myself that like it doesn't matter. Like you can meet somebody within the year, if you guys are right for each other, right? What do you think?
THERAPIST: You've asked me a couple times today what I think when you have a particular idea of what's right.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I wonder why.
CLIENT: Well, it's nice to see how everybody's point of view. Everybody is different.
THERAPIST: It seemed like some of the points of view I expressed though you didn't like.
CLIENT: That you've expressed?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: No, that's not true.
THERAPIST: You don't think so?
CLIENT: Uh uh.
THERAPIST: It seemed like you didn't like my perspective on medication and pregnancy. [30:00]
CLIENT: Oh, no, I did. It was nice-it actually was nice to hear that. It's just-I was just-I thought it was funny, the difference of opinions.
THERAPIST: Mm hm. And people do have different opinions.
CLIENT: Yeah. It actually made me feel better, because I feel like I would need medication.
THERAPIST: It's really not uncommon for women to be on anti-depressants during pregnancy. There's one, I think it's Paxil, that's considered actually dangerous [inaudible].
CLIENT: That's nice.
THERAPIST: But do I think it's possible to meet someone within a year and feel they're right for you? Of course. It's completely possible. You feel-I mean, on the one hand you're in a better place in terms of how you feel about the relationship and feeling like more settled in terms of seeing how things ","P1-N400DD1":"play out. But then what creeps in, time and the passage of time and the things that you'll want for yourself in life. And then you start to feel worried about that, that you don't want to sit idly by and let too much time go by, and so that makes you anxious.
CLIENT: Yeah. Definitely. And I'm only giving, I don't know, like until our lease is up.
THERAPIST: When is that?
CLIENT: Next August. So.
THERAPIST: Like ten months.
CLIENT: Mm hm. And that's it.
THERAPIST: That's a while.
CLIENT: Yeah. It's doable. I just feel like I want to like make the right decision [unclear 31:51], you know? Like where I'm not just making an impulsive decision because I'm upset. I want to make sure I'm making the right decision. I mean, like I want to be with somebody that's happy too. Like if he's ","P1-N400EB1":"not happy, and he's not willing to like change so he's happier, like this is never going to work. We'll see, he's trying to work on things. And I'm trying to work on myself. So if this-if we're in the same situation in ten more months like then it's just not worth it. Because we've been together for ","P1-N400EB2":"like-known each other for like 11 years, and we've been together this will be our fifth year, and I think we've been happy for one.
THERAPIST: When was the one? [33:00]
CLIENT: Before his dad died. We were happy. And we didn't argue. We didn't live together. He was in a better job, he was happy in his job, made good money. And we had a lot more time for each other. And then his father died, he stopped going to work, stopped paying his bills, started hanging out with ","P1-N400EF1":"the wrong people again. And he lost his car, got arrested. And then we've fought ever since. And like I just don't get that he doesn't see that he's changed so much, like within that year. And I was trying to be like a supportive person. [And those things? 34:01] really bring you down too, you know. ","P1-N400EF2":"Like he [unclear], even in this relationship [that we've been through?]. And like I thought he was a very caring person that I could tell anything to. And he's so like closed up, so closed-minded. He thinks one way. He thinks about like, "Well, why couldn't you just do this?" He never thinks about like ","P1-N400EF3":"how I like things. I think even sex, like it's always like how he wants to have sex. Like he doesn't even think about like what would turn me on, he just thinks about himself. And I think that's-like it doesn't work in a relationship. I'm sorry. [35:15]
THERAPIST: It sounds like he made some pretty bad decisions at the very least. [38:00]
CLIENT: Yes he does. And he told me, he's like, "I've always had to struggle. I'll always have to struggle. I don't mind struggling." And I'm like, "Yeah, you're struggling because you make bad decisions." And then he'll say, "Don't rub it in my face, that makes me feel bad. Do you want me to feel bad?" ","P1-N400F71":"I'm like, "I can't even talk to you." This is how our conversations go. And then he asks me to ask one of my friends that have been married for a long time, or somebody that they knew, he said, "Do me a favor and ask somebody at work that's been married for a long time and see if they have different ","P1-N400F72":"lives and if they like have different interests." And then I was like, "Why?" And I was like, "I'm not trying to spend every day with you, we never see each other. I just want quality time. Like just one good day." And he's like, "Well, it seems like you want me to be around all the time." And I'm like, ","P1-N400F73":""That's where I disagree. That's where I feel like we are not communicating and seeing-" Like that's just what I don't want in a relationship. I want somebody that wants to spend their free time, you know. And like I can't believe he-and then he said I took it the wrong way. How would you take that statement?
THERAPIST: You're unhappy in this relationship. [40:00]
CLIENT: [pause] [crying] I know. [pause] I just thought he'd want to change for us. And he is little steps at a time, but it's just taking too long, you know. And I shouldn't like marry somebody that-you know, that I'm going to be unhappy with for the rest of my life. So until our lease is up, like ","P1-N400FB1":"I just-I don't know right now.
THERAPIST: Ten months is a long time to wait.
CLIENT: Financially it works out. Because he does like give me half of the rent. I can't break my lease. And I don't want to make a decision right now. Like I just, I don't know. And that stinks. I'm just afraid.
THERAPIST: Of?
CLIENT: I don't know, making the wrong decision.
THERAPIST: What would the wrong decision look like? How would it be wrong, or how would you know it was wrong?
CLIENT: If I like walk away from this relationship, and the fact that like we could have worked things out, I would be really upset.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: Because I really love him. I just wish he like could understand like what I'm going through. [42:00]
THERAPIST: Well, how do you understand what the two of you need to do to work it out?
CLIENT: I know that I need to be less emotional, and less like, I don't know, forward with him, because he takes it the wrong way. He thinks like I'm attacking him, but I'm just being honest. And I just-I don't like not being honest, that's just me. So I have to say things different to him, and like ","P1-N4010F1":"in a more positive way. And then he needs to just be more like-he needs to work on his self and find a direction, and he needs to be happier, and then I see us like working out. But if he's just going to stay in his nest like he's always done it's not going to work. And I think like those are changes ","P1-N4010F2":"that can be made, like that's possible. Right?
THERAPIST: Anything in theory is possible.
CLIENT: Well-
THERAPIST: I mean, but can he? Like-
CLIENT: -I'm just saying like if it wasn't possible, if I believed that it couldn't happen, I don't think that I would stay with him. I hate the fact that like there's a possibility that we could work through this, and then walking away from it. You know. And having like a regret. Like I just feel like ","P1-N401171":"I can [live with? 43:53] therapy, try to control my emotions so I can speak with him better, and be more positive and a happier person, and he needs to work on his self too. [44:00]
THERAPIST: Well, your piece is completely possible, because it's within your control. What he will or won't do, as you know, who knows. I don't know.
CLIENT: I don't either.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: That's what makes it hard. Like if he cheated on me, if he got somebody else pregnant, if he's on drugs, if he was abusive, like I would be gone. The fact that it's like financial and everything, it's hard for me.
THERAPIST: Well, you want him to be more responsible, not only in the relationship but just for his own good. I mean, take more charge of his life and be more proactive-
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: -and engaged. That's what you really question about him.
CLIENT: I'd be really hurt if he did that, if we broke up and he did all those things after this relationship.
THERAPIST: You'd be hurt because you-because...
CLIENT: Because I was like, why couldn't you do that when you were with me? You know? I take offense to that.
THERAPIST: Hm. Like he was intentionally withholding something? I see. Why would he do that?
CLIENT: I don't know. And sometimes I think he has like an evil side to him. He does things like intentionally. He has like two different sides to him. He's the nicest person, but if you piss him off, like he's wicked, he's really mean. And spiteful. And then he thinks that we can move on after that. ","P1-N4012F1":"Like if we have a fight like that I don't move on. And that's when he wants us to just move on and not talk about it, because it makes it worse to talk about it. I don't know. After you hurt me, if we don't talk about it and resolve it, I'm never going to be able to move on. Like, I'm never going to ","P1-N4012F2":"be able to trust you. So that's about it. But all I can do is work on myself and figure out things, and it's going to take time. And yeah, this relationship is like very difficult.
THERAPIST: Mm hm. And you feel very confused, both about what's going to happen, but also just about how you feel and what you should do. And in a sense you're confused about how best to take care of yourself to sort of give this time and see what evolves. Or is it the best way to make a decision and ","P1-N401311":"so that you can sort of, you know, open up your opportunities for pursuing what it is that you want in terms of marriage and a family. [47:00]
CLIENT: Yeah, that's-it's hard. I don't know-
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: -[how to pursue it?].
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: I think that's just going to take time.
THERAPIST: Mm hm, mm hm. Okay Marlene, we're going to need to stop for today, okay.
CLIENT: All right.
THERAPIST: When was the week that you couldn't come?
CLIENT: Uh, the 12th, right? Is that our next [unclear]?
THERAPIST: That's next week.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Are you wanting to find another time, or are you wanting to skip that?
CLIENT: I think I just would be-you know, just skip that one. Is that okay?
THERAPIST: Yeah, okay.
CLIENT: Because I'm going to-
THERAPIST: Okay, scratch the 12th.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. Very good. So then I'll see you in two weeks.
CLIENT: Okay. And then there's like the holidays.
THERAPIST: Oh, thank you. I'm around. I mean, I'm not [overtalk] that week.
CLIENT: Just like holidays where like if it's on a Thanksgiving or New Years Eve or something like that I probably won't be able to.
THERAPIST: Well, we'll be meeting on Tuesday, and Thanksgiving's on a Thursday. Are you concerned about the Tuesday? [48:00]
CLIENT: Um, nope. I'll have to look. I am concerned more like when it comes to I think New Years Eve.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, well I think that the Tuesday afternoon is Christmas Eve and New Years.
CLIENT: Yeah, and then [unclear].
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Because [unclear] we have Christmas off they might want me to work.
THERAPIST: Okay. Okay, that's at the end of next month, so you can just let me know. But I'll be here through Wednesday of Thanksgiving weekend, because Thanksgiving isn't until Thursday, so I'll be here that Tuesday.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay. So then I will see you in two weeks.
CLIENT: All right.
THERAPIST: Okay, thank you.
CLIENT: Thank you. Have a nice day.
THERAPIST: Thanks.
