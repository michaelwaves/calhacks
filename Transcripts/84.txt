DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the events leading up a recent altercation with her boyfriend and how it conjured up her issues with trust and abandonment.
THERAPIST: This is so just in case, but they know that I'm supposed to be here, so I'll put it there and they'll take care of it.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I just wanted to talk about one of our scheduling books -
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So I'm here in the office next week, but I'm not going to be here during our time. I have to step out for about a two-hour window, but I can see you at a different time if you want to put a different time.
CLIENT: Okay. Well, I may or may not be here anyway, so I will let you know, I guess on Thursday. I might play (inaudible at 00:00:33) or something, but I'm not sure, so I'll just let you know.
THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah, you had mentioned that.
CLIENT: I'm trying to think. So, well, I think now that we're sort of close to the whole court date on Friday is where my mind is really focusing on. Having conversations with my boyfriend, and just talking, and feeling a little bit better about being able to talk to him, and actually a lot less reserved ","P1-N400191":"than I have been for the last year. [00:01:11]
THERAPIST: What do you think made you concerned about that in particular?
CLIENT: I just his resentment?
THERAPIST: Um-hm.
CLIENT: It's not that he blames me for it, but at the same time, I feel like sometimes I blame myself for I know I've had issues, and I know I've had problems. I'm not very good when I drink, and I'm not always the most pleasant person. I do say things that I shouldn't say, and I think it's a lot ","P1-N400291":"of whatever feelings I'm harboring or I have inside of me, that's when, for whatever reason, I find the opportunity to say them, and in the past, it has caused some tension between us, and we've had arguments before. It's never escalated to this point, and now I almost feel guilt and blame for I've ","P1-N400292":"had all these warning signs that I'm not okay to drink, and I always think, okay, well, I'll just have one or two and then I'll be fine, but then it just goes from there, and I don't stop, but I function. [00:08:13]
THERAPIST: I'm sorry, the decision to?
CLIENT: To not drink so much, and to just yeah, basically just that decision alone. My mom basically, when she was up here, she said, "I know you were drinking, and you have to promise me that you won't anymore," and I was sort of was like, "Yeah, I promise," whatever, but the more I think about it, ","P1-N400331":"I'm just like I don't want to because I don't want to have any more issues, and I don't want to feel like what am I'm going to say or what am I'm going to do if I do have a couple of drinks, and it's too much. [00:11:19]
THERAPIST: What did you say to him that concerns you?
CLIENT: We were having my previous boyfriend who I moved here for -it's sort of like is something that had happened, something that's never happened between him and I, so it's kind of, I guess, from prior things. So long story short, I guess, the boyfriend that I had before, I never trusted him. I ","P1-N400371":"never trusted him as far as I could throw him. And I always knew I need to get out of this, I need to get out of this, but then I just stayed because I felt like, oh, well, now I'm just determined to stay. [00:12:13]
THERAPIST: I was asking what -
CLIENT: Oh, you asked me why is it that I felt like I was (crosstalk).
THERAPIST: No, no, no. Well, what you said to him that you felt so bad about.
CLIENT: I think just saying that in general, and just the fact that how could I not remember. The not remembering part is what really frustrates me and bothers me because there will be a period of time where I'm just out of it and I don't remember, and then I snap back into it, and I'm like, this is ","P1-N4004D1":"just not okay. And it happens more often than not, and I don't really want to be that kind of person where I can't go out and enjoy having a drink or two because it goes too far, and then I say things that I would never actually say, but just because of whatever reason, I happen to say them. I mean, ","P1-N4004D2":"there have been many of times when he's said, "You said this or you said that," and the next day, I'm like, what? That doesn't even make sense, or I don't even feel that way. Why would I say that? And so now, I do feel this guilt about drinking too much and then saying things that I shouldn't say, and ","P1-N4004D3":"I don't want him to resent me for that. [00:22:53]
THERAPIST: Well, it seems like I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
CLIENT: That's it.
THERAPIST: It seems like part of your worry is ending up feeling like you felt with your mother. You're always doing something wrong, feeling badly, feeling guilty.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I do feel like I do have that insecurity that I am doing something wrong. And I know that there are times when I react to a certain way and I say things that I shouldn't necessarily be saying, and I should be conveying if I am feeling a certain way about something. Having a few ","P1-N400571":"drinks and then saying it in an inappropriate manner whereas just being able to talk about it before it's actually still inside stewing in there and then it comes out the wrong way, I would much rather be able to feel comfortable enough to say it and get it out and over with, and that way it doesn't ","P1-N400572":"end up in the wrong situation, I guess, and I think that's what I end up doing. [00:25:41]
THERAPIST: Because I was going to ask why it is hard for you to say what's bothering you.
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess a lot of the times I feel like if I say, well, this is bothering me, is it going to end up or am I'm going to be told that I'm ridiculous because I've heard that many of times, and even Kevin has said it to me, like, "You're being ridiculous." And I have recently said to him, ","P1-N4005D1":""The reason why I get afraid of saying stuff to you is because I don't want to hear why I'm upset is because I'm just ridiculous." And we've talked about that, and he corrected the way he reacts to things, but I'm still just not fully comfortable saying whatever, and fearing, okay, well, if I say this, ","P1-N4005D2":"are you going to leave, or are you going to make fun of me. Are you going to judge me, anything like that as to why sometimes I don't like saying stuff to people. [00:27:48]
THERAPIST: That what you say won't be received, or will be ill-received? [00:28:43]
CLIENT: Yeah. And then it's sort of like sometimes I feel, too, if I talk or something is bothering me, it's sometimes it's like a catch-22. If something is bothering me, and it really is fairly insignificant, like maybe somebody said something and it irritated me because I feel like sometimes I'm ","P1-N400631":"on a hair trigger, but I don't know if that's just because I'm not completely happy with where I am right now, so sometimes everything just irritates me. And so when something bothers me, there are times when I need to mull it around in my head, and then I'm like, okay, well, this is really insignificant. ","P1-N400632":"It doesn't really matter. I probably don't really need to be irritated by it, or whatever. [00:29:45]
THERAPIST: Well, and when you feel that you're acting in any way like her, really worries you. It scares you.
CLIENT: Yeah. And then it starts to bother me even more, and then I just feel guilty, and then I feel angry at her, and resentful that, my god, now I'm acting like you and I'm ruining relationships that I shouldn't be ruining, and I'm getting angry at things that are just so insignificant and silly. ","P1-N4006B1":"And I have no reason to be.
THERAPIST: Well, I was thinking that when you just said resentment, and that's how you started, that I wonder whether you worry your boyfriend Kevin will feel towards you that you feel toward your mother. But you do feel resentful of some things about her. You're worried that he's going to feel that ","P1-N4006D1":"way about you.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I do because the more I think about it and the more I realize everything that's happening, I do feel resentful to her, and now I feel like is he going to start feeling the same way, and I'm fairly scared of that. I don't want him to feel that way towards me. I'm sure my mom doesn't ","P1-N4006F1":"want me to resent her. And I don't want him to blame me for things happening, even though I do feel like I take a lot of the blame for how our relationship has gone, and me putting up this wall of not feeling like I can talk to people, or say when things are bothering me, which has caused tension because ","P1-N4006F2":"then I just yell and, or say things at the wrong time when I've had too much to drink, or something along that line. [00:34:01]
THERAPIST: Well, it's a bad paring to be very worried about people leaving you and then also feeling like you have the ability to push people away.
CLIENT: Yeah, because I feel like it's this vicious cycle. I try to keep him closer, but the more I try to do that, the more it's hurting the situation. The night that we had our fight, I didn't want him to leave, and I was so afraid of him leaving, and then what if I let him leave and all he wanted ","P1-N400751":"to do was just go for a walk and leave, but because of my insecurities and people always leaving, or shutting me out, I was scared that yet again, he was going to, and that caused a whole situation that really didn't even need to happen. And I feel a little guilty that I haven't dealt with those feelings ","P1-N400752":"of abandonment for after 28 years of whatever. [00:36:31]
THERAPIST: Why not? Why shouldn't it?
CLIENT: Because it seemed pretty insignificant. I mean, it's fairly easy for me to go out. I mean, I needed a pair of black pants because I don't have any that fit anyway, so I mean, and I guess I was at the store and none of the pants were fitting correctly that I wanted. So it was a combination of ","P1-N4007F1":"that, too, and then feeling like I don't know what to wear to court on Friday, even though I shouldn't really be worried about what I'm wearing, but after asking people, they're like they aren't supposed to take into account what you wear, but they do. And no failing concern, like I don't want them ","P1-N4007F2":"to think that we're some just trashy people walking in in our jeans and t-shirts. I wanted to present ourselves as being fairly, I guess, normal people who this doesn't happen to all the time. [00:40:42]
THERAPIST: So you feel that you shouldn't feel infuriated about your mom feeling entitled to strip you of your free will and autonomy.
CLIENT: I mean, I guess I should. I guess I have every right to be angry and mad about it, but I don't know. At the time, it was like, okay, well, I'm getting angry because I can't find any pants, and I had been in the dressing room 15 times, and all of the pants at the store were, you know, one of ","P1-N400871":"them wasn't fitting right, and I was getting frustrated, and they were really busy. And then the more I started to think about it, I'm like, I'm just really getting mad because my mom took my clothes, and I shouldn't have to be out here spending three hours at the mall looking for something to wear ","P1-N400872":"when I have so many clothes, I mean, that I don't need to buy any more clothes. So then it was frustrating about that, and then it went more into the fact, like, she took my clothes and I didn't want her to, and she didn't need to sort of thing, so I talked myself out of being extremely angry, and it's ","P1-N400873":"fine, just relax. Just pick up a pair of pants. She'll send you the shirt. It'll be fine, and I kind of relaxed a little bit. It still made me angry. [00:45:09]
THERAPIST: It upsets you when you have really strong, intense feelings.
CLIENT: Yes. I feel like, I don't know, almost like I shouldn't have such strong and intense feelings, or maybe they're just not warranted, or something. I mean, I don't know if it's from making it known to whomever my mom that I have such strong feelings, and then being told, "Well, that's stupid. ","P1-N4008B1":"Why do you have those feelings?" I haven't really figured that out yet, but I do feel like I'm beating myself up a little bit when I have such strong and intense feelings. I'm not allowed to have them.
THERAPIST: You do. You do. You know, and we need to stop for today.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay? I'll see you on Thursday.
CLIENT: Yes, 1:20, right?
THERAPIST: Yep, you got it.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Have a good rest of the day.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Okay, take care. [00:46:17]
