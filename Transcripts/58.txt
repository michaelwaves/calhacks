DESCRIPTION: Client discusses his anger and anxiety over always feeling like he isn't allowed to express himself for sake of other people's feelings, especially his wife's feelings. He speaks openly about his strong feelings of love and attraction towards the therapist.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.
CLIENT: Good morning.
THERAPIST: Good morning.
CLIENT: Thank you for seeing me again.
THERAPIST: Sure, my pleasure.
CLIENT: I stopped, we talked toward the end of last time a lot about my feelings about you and about therapy. Sigh, sigh. In talking about it, I expected it to be very anxious after leaving, I’ll talk more about it in a moment, but because of that, I feel like I’ve been avoiding that subject ","P1-N400151":"for a long time. [00:01:08]
THERAPIST: Not so much, I don’t think.
CLIENT: So it’s a silly way of doing things, but it’s how we do it. As a result, though, there is never clear guidelines as to what to include in the application. General guidelines, but it’s not that helpful. The associated claim is always, well they’re getting multiple applications ","P1-N4001F1":"a day all the time so yours has to stand out. Well, it would be nice to have a, you know, some metric for what a good application looks like. So that is also anxiety-inducing, so I think that played into it some.
THERAPIST: So what do you think you’re feeling anxious about? [00:03:59]
CLIENT: [LONG SILENCE] It’s a, I spent a lot of time thinking about this while I was anxious. At some point, was anxious enough that it was difficult to do any work, so I really need to pay attention to this and handle it. [00:05:01]
THERAPIST: Too much, that’s the implication.
CLIENT: Yeah. At least, that’s how I feel right now. So certainly with anger, I’ve spent a lot of time like controlling how I express it, or attempting to control how much of it I have, I think. I’ve talked a lot about that, for a long time now, about how I can like put it away and ","P1-N400311":"then it’s not really gone, I’m just not facing it because I don’t feel like someone else can handle it. [00:09:18]
THERAPIST: So what about the feelings themselves make you anxious? Having them? The implications of them?
CLIENT: So I think there’s, I think there’s, having them makes me one kind of anxious and then talking about them another kind. I don’t know if they manifest any differently, but I think they are separate pieces. [00:11:08]
THERAPIST: Thank you.
CLIENT: Thank you for hearing that and responding that way. But I think one piece of anxiety is I was scared of facing that myself, and scared of telling you. [00:14:07]
THERAPIST: Well, thank you.
CLIENT: I don’t think I’ve ever had anybody respond with “Thank you” to that. You’re welcome.
THERAPIST: Is that a surprising response?
CLIENT: I can also talk more loudly, if -
THERAPIST: No, no, that’s OK. It was loud enough, so it was— [00:16:01]
CLIENT: And so I think last time we got close enough to those subjects to inspire a great deal of anxiety. I really appreciate you actually coaxing it out of me last session. It was important to me that it get said then, so I could start trying, and whatever you said at the end was very helpful for ","P1-N400511":"awhile, so thank you for that also. So the anxiety is still there, or is more there, you know, there’s anxiety about saying, there’s anxiety about if I just suppress it then I have control over it in some way. [00:17:06]
THERAPIST: How so?
CLIENT: Maybe you will find my feelings repulsive. I think, actually, the worst case for me would be if you found my feelings were repulsive, but also felt a sense of professionalism and said, “I will keep working with you and not tell you that I feel repulsive, or feel repulsed.”
THERAPIST: Sound pretty bad. It sounds like a bad case.
CLIENT: I feel like if you feel, felt repulsed and said, “I don’t want to see you any more, we can’t meet any more that that would be,” you know, that would hurt some, that would be hard, but I can deal with closure, things that end. I can have, for whatever reason, better tools ","P1-N4005B1":"to handle it, or feel it. [00:18:11]
THERAPIST: I can see why the first case is better than the second case.
CLIENT: Better than the second case? Or worse.
THERAPIST: The first case is better because at least there’s not a semblance of saying, “Goodbye,” versus sort of, I don’t know what I would describe the second case to be, kind of, extremely inauthentic encounter.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Seems yucky.
CLIENT: Yeah, but it also seems like, I think, I’m not saying I think it’s the correct choice, if that were the situation, but it’s a thing I could see a person doing. [00:19:11]
THERAPIST: I guess the reasonable reason was I wouldn’t want to hurt your feelings.
CLIENT: Yes, not that that’s yeah, again, that’s a correct choice, but—
THERAPIST: Well at least one way to think about it is your feelings about me mean something about you, and that we have the opportunity to talk about that. They don’t only mean something about you, but they certainly mean something about you.
CLIENT: Sure. [00:20:01]
THERAPIST: And I think about, there are two other things, well one other thing that comes to mind that has two facets to it. [00:20:58]
CLIENT: That makes sense, not in detail, like I don’t, yeah. So I think what I really need at this moment is reassurance. Are you OK? Are we OK? [00:22:52]
THERAPIST: Absolutely. I’m more than OK, because like this, I don’t know, like I feel this, like very good things are going to come out of this. Like I feel like I don’t know, I feel like this is, there are obviously, you know, a lot of limitations on the two of us as two people in ","P1-N4007D1":"the world, but there’s so much in terms of what it means about you and your growth and development and what you need in life that this is about.
CLIENT: Thank you. [LONG SILENCE].
THERAPIST: And it certainly speaks to the way you, in which you crave and feel unfulfilled, at least to some extent, being taken care of and nurtured and cared for by someone you respect and are drawn to and look up to. [00:25:11]
CLIENT: My sort of initial response of, “Who are you talking about in my life?” Sort of a variety of relationships that that describes in one way or another. [00:26:59]
THERAPIST: Well it depends on what, yes and no. I mean, I don’t specifically study historically a lot of cults, no. I certainly have ideas but I guess it also depends.
CLIENT: But you do have like professional, a professional understanding of the—
THERAPIST: The dynamics of it? Yeah, somewhat.
CLIENT: Right. I guess I don’t—
THERAPIST: Yes, somewhat, yes.
CLIENT: If it’s most of those, so you know, not like that I have read psych theory all that, but there are a number of psychiatrists or ‘ologists, both that write at least some about it. [00:30:03]
THERAPIST: What made you decide that, did something appear online or did you sort of seek out?
CLIENT: Oh, I sought it out, yeah.
THERAPIST: Oh, well is there something that brought it to mind this weekend in particular? [00:31:01]
CLIENT: No, or this is the thing that I started out by saying, I can’t trace it back, so I think I had told you some time ago that Dr. Jannis (sp?) talked about Tanya and I’s relationship as having lots of other people in the room, sort of suggesting that Tanya’s family background, ","P1-N400A31":"if they’re present in our relationship and her abusive high school relationship is very present, and I think he suggested for me, this organization’s also present. That was fine, I don’t object to that in any particular way.
THERAPIST: Well that was, one of the ways I was listening to it, I’m also just very curious about it, and it’s interesting that you thought about it this weekend, but it sort of addressed the second part of what I said, in terms of the extent to which your feelings grow out of the structure ","P1-N400B51":"of this relationship, irrespective of who I am as a person.
CLIENT: Yeah, and, and I heard that that’s where I think I said I agree in detail. I don’t have a clear hold on that. [00:37:04]
THERAPIST: Yeah, well I’m someone who meets people at often their most vulnerable time, and there’s definitely a power structure to it. Power structure’s—it’s a complicated power structure. It’s not only one direction. I mean, you’re, you know, to put it very ","P1-N400BB1":"crudely, my employer in some respects, right? So there’s—it’s not, so there’s some, you know, the power structure’s complicated. But there’s certainly the idea that you’re entrusting yourself, you know, in my care. And that I’m, and that there are ways ","P1-N400BB2":"in which it’s easy, easier certainly, to bracket my needs and who I am, to be attentive to you in ways that are not structures of other relationships to help bring that out. [00:38:00]
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, which I don’t feel like you do, and I’m very grateful for. But yeah, that has a common feature to people who either, it’s not quite clear to me, people who go to cults and keep going to cults because they’re still missing the same thing, or because they’ve ","P1-N400BF1":"been trained to be looking for that same thing. But it’s sort of an observation that it’s fairly common to go from one to another. [00:39:04]
THERAPIST: You do, because you see the dark side of them, which there are. I mean, the dark side is not to be ignored. The dark side is there when people in powers of authority are there to either treat the people over whom they have power as objects, or to actively exploit them, which are somewhat ","P1-N400C31":"different but you either just treat them as nonhumans or actively abuse them.
CLIENT: Yes, right, no that makes sense.
THERAPIST: And they probably relate. They even have both happen at the same time.
CLIENT: Sure, sure.
THERAPIST: But you’re very aware of how, and you know, the reality is that with most power structures, there’s good and bad. In a cult, the bad far outweighs the good. In a lot of power structures you could probably find features of deeply problematic, you know, aspects, like you know, in ","P1-N400CB1":"academic settings where you could certainly see those pieces of maybe more, hopefully the entire structure isn’t designed that way. [00:40:18]
CLIENT: I probably see cults as more balanced than you do.
THERAPIST: Maybe.
CLIENT: Because I’m also very aware of the good that is in them, particularly far away from the center.
THERAPIST: Well, certainly the power of feeling connected with whom you’re, especially if you’re away from the center and not as susceptible to the gravitational pull of the center, that on the edges, I imagine, it’s an extremely bonding experience.
CLIENT: That’s right, that’s right.
THERAPIST: And communal, and very—
CLIENT: They’re all people who share your values, right?
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: That’s always the way. [00:41:00]
THERAPIST: Absolutely. So yeah, I actually hope that maybe it is true, but I hope that it’s not true that they would, I hope that I would see the good in cults too.
CLIENT: Well you certainly saw it just fine when we talked about it, so I think I have more experience of it than you do.
THERAPIST: That’s probably true.
CLIENT: So that’s almost silly to say that, but—
THERAPIST: It happens to be true. But you think very deeply about, you know, the sort of the corrupting influences of power and then, but you know, the other side, somewhere, you know, by definition, someone who’s caring for you and taking care of you and ministering to you in a way that you’re ","P1-N400EB1":"not to them is a position of power, by definition.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And there’s something deeply appealing about that for all of us. [00:42:00]
CLIENT: Do you have that in your life? Is that too personal?
THERAPIST: That, and when you say that?
CLIENT: People speaking to your needs, ministering to you, taking care of you?
THERAPIST: I feel taken care of by the people in my life. I feel like it probably less, it feels less of a power imbalance than I think this particular situation, this structure of our relationships is.
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: If that—
CLIENT: No, it does. I would hope so, I think.
THERAPIST: Well I wanted to, you know, be that person, you know.
CLIENT: Good. I’m fine.
THERAPIST: I think it would be hard to do this work if I didn’t feel that way.
CLIENT: That makes sense.
THERAPIST: What were you, in asking that, do you have thoughts about like when you’re curious about it, you just wanted to know? [00:43:00]
CLIENT: Yeah, I care about you and I’m curious about you, and those overlap very heavily at that point, I think. Oh, so I started talking about drifting from cult to cult because I feel like there’s a not too, it’s not too bad an analogy to describe the U.S. military as a cult, it ","P1-N401091":"certainly treats people both as objects and you could argue, abuses them. It depends, and so I think it’s particularly interesting that my younger brother sort of sees that structure as fulfilling now. He wasn’t really a part of the cult, but he’s still like, (inaudible at 00:44:01) ","P1-N401092":"by my parents. [00:44:01]
THERAPIST: Is he still in high school or is he in college?
CLIENT: He’s in college. So is my other sibling.
THERAPIST: And your youngest is in the ROTC in college.
CLIENT: That’s right.
THERAPIST: I actually don’t think I even knew that.
CLIENT: Yeah, it’s the Junior ROTC. And so you can see how I might be particularly, OK—
THERAPIST: Wow, that’s—
CLIENT: Has a different impact on you when I put it at that age then, OK.
THERAPIST: Wow. I actually didn’t know that existed.
CLIENT: A little disturbing, isn’t it?
THERAPIST: Wow. Has that been, is that like a, like that’s not new, they’ve had the Junior ROTC program?
CLIENT: It’s existed for, I don’t know how long, actually, I think for a long time. [00:45:07]
THERAPIST: I was thinking, I mean I certainly have my own personal associations to the ROTC, and then I also thought about, you know how, for some people, joining the army or military can be extremely organizing and meaningful and provide some people who really feel like they’re completely lost ","P1-N401271":"in their life, addictions and so forth, a meaning and purpose much greater than them and where they feel very valuable, so I mean, I was just sort of, I’m actually making a counterargument in my own mind.
CLIENT: And for me, that’s part of the argument. So the thing that the cult gives you, so one interesting quote I read said something to the effect of, “The people who join cults are by and large just normal people. They tend to actually be, yes, they’re missing something, but they’re,” ","P1-N401291":"[00:46:13]
THERAPIST: Well this is very, I’m very important because it’s important to you and my helping you is very interesting too. We do need to stop for today, I will see you on Wednesday.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Okay, great.
CLIENT: I’m glad we will.
THERAPIST: Okay, take care.
CLIENT: You too.
