DESCRIPTION: Client discusses a life choice she made several years back that she believes had an impact on where she is in her life today. Client blames herself for this decision and wonders how things would be different.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.
CLIENT: I don't really feel like talking today. [pause]
THERAPIST: Why not?
CLIENT: I don't know, I just-I have too much on my mind, I'm at work, and run errands and not talk about crap. [chuckles] [pause] I guess I wanted to ask if-what you thought about last time the way that I looked at things, or the narrative that I have about like my breakdown and stuff from like two ","P1-N400151":"years, you know, like of not going to see Chris and going my separate way, which involved seeing other guys. Like what-if you could help me look at it differently. Or just look at it through different lenses, I don't know.
THERAPIST: Was that the first time that you had gone to see somebody else, and that you had cheated on him essentially, is that the first time? [4:50]
CLIENT: I think so, yeah, in seven years. I mean, Graham had come to D.C. a couple times and I'd gone and seen him for-like gone and had dinner together. And one time he tried to kiss me, but I was just totally like, "What the hell are you doing? You just had tea with me at my place and Chris was there." ","P1-N400191":"So I was totally like a proper girlfriend who, you know, threw birthday parties and was totally devoted. [chuckles]
THERAPIST: Is it something that you had thought about before?
CLIENT: No, not really. I was very sexually like inexperienced and happy to be that way, and like yeah. But just being with-just, you know, didn't really think much about the stuff, Chris and I didn't really question it or find it lacking or anything like that.
THERAPIST: So something really dramatically shifted in you.
CLIENT: I feel like it's also hormonal, it's not just psychological.
THERAPIST: How so?
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: How so?
CLIENT: I don't know, I'm getting older. [chuckles]
THERAPIST: But it sounds like that, I mean, there was a very-like, you know, after this happened you're going to go and see, was it-no, it wasn't Orny who you saw, Graham?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Who did you see, Graham?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So, I mean, maybe over time it's hormonal, but at that moment where you, you know, say, "I'm going to Graham's," I mean, that's-I guess I'm saying if it wasn't something that you had thought about previously it seems like a very big shift to already have it-all of a sudden have that on your ","P1-N400331":"mind and then go do it.
CLIENT: Well, it wasn't-okay, so it was a bit-slightly more gradual I guess. I need like a timeline in front of me now. Let's see. So I went part-time in September, October 2011, and yeah, I think it was like October 1st. I think I've told you about this, like the October Fest and the three girls [laughs] ","P1-N400351":"in my neighborhood, and me feeling like, "What the hell is that?" And like, "What is that all about?" [7:30]
THERAPIST: I don't remember the three girls part.
CLIENT: Yeah, I told you.
THERAPIST: I remember you sort of having a sexual awakening.
CLIENT: [laughs] It's not that, it's just like curiosity about what's with that side of things, you know. Just likeSo Chris had left in, I don't know, August-let's say August 15th. And, you know, I had gone part-time, which meant like I had to go and work three days a week? It was one day I was working ","P1-N4003D1":"from home and two days I was going to work. What a sweet deal. [chuckles] Yeah. And yeah, then October Fest was going on in my neighborhood in Hamden with all your collegiate-like three different women three different times in the night screaming. And this was trying to fall asleep, and I was just like-you ","P1-N4003D2":"know, there's a whole atmosphere.
THERAPIST: How do you mean it was kind of childish? [15:30]
CLIENT: Well, it wasn't-like we didn't have sex [or "wasn't like we didn't have sex?" unclear whether this means did or did not have sex], and we didn't really-neither of us were very adventurous or anything, so it was just-like, you know, it wasn't very intense, you know. I don't know like why you ","P1-N4004F1":"have to know that, I mean like sexual experience, but I guess I'm doing it. I'm looking at it critically, this whole thing. [sighs] I mean, I definitely, you know, loved him. I still love him. So like that was-that's how I looked it, you know, like it brings you closer a little bit. I haven't been in ","P1-N4004F2":"that moment for two or three years, two years. I don't really know, I can't really think like that anymore. But that's a big shift. [chuckles]
THERAPIST: When you say think of it what are you referring to?
CLIENT: Just this thing of not going to Chris, and going the other-opposite direction.
THERAPIST: That day.
CLIENT: Since then. I guess like going for lust instead of love, going for-and again, you'll be like these are your binaries and why you have them, but-I don't know if you will say that, but I'm just thinking.
THERAPIST: Well, one way of thinking about it which isn't that fancy is that you feel ambivalent about Chris, and you're not sure if you want somebody else.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It's not like you're saying, "I know Chris's for me, I love him. All I want to do is just be with him, he's what I want. Why am I going with these other guys?" That's a very different kind of why.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So there's that. And part of why you don't go to him is because you don't know if you want to be with him.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And the other part I think is that you're angry with him.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So you're going to-if he's not going to give you want then just turn to somebody else. [21:00]
CLIENT: And that's wrong, right?
THERAPIST: It depends on how you want to live your life.
CLIENT: How do I want to live my life?
THERAPIST: I don't know.
CLIENT: Yes you do. [chuckles]
THERAPIST: No, you wouldn't want to hear my-
CLIENT: Yes you do.
THERAPIST: Only you can tell that. I can't tell you how you're going to live your life or what you want from life.
CLIENT: I look-I mean, I've seen it in bits and pieces in other people. I'm scared to explore everything, and besides you can't explore everything. But you can kind of imbibe other people's principles and learn from them. Like I think I would like [to be] someone like my professor. [chuckles] I'm not ","P1-N4007F1":"like totally fascinated or infatuated with him because-yeah, I'm not. But I feel like he is kind of-he's-yeah, I want to be like him. [chuckles] In the sense that he is very smart, very articulate, and he's, you know, an established writer. But he looks at people and thinks about them and interacts ","P1-N4007F2":"with them in this very-in this way that is totally like... Yeah, I mean, I respect that approach a lot.
THERAPIST: Wait, I don't-Chris was saying this?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What was he responding to?
CLIENT: I don't know, I can't remember.
THERAPIST: He just woke up saying that?
CLIENT: No, no, no, we were having a conversation. I can't remember now. But we were talking about stuff. Yeah, I can't remember right now. [pause] I don't know. [pause] Should I keep trying to remember, or move on? [24:30]
THERAPIST: I don't know, it seems like kind of a dramatic thing to say, so it must have been an important conversation.
CLIENT: Well, we were talking-so we're doing a class assignment, and I was talking about that, and... [pause] I really can't remember. But it was in the context of something related. But yeah, so I just wonder like... um... [sighs] Like yeah, I'm wondering about whether that is the right approach for ","P1-N400911":"me, or that's how I want to live my life, to know people and see the good in them. Because I feel like I am very judgmental, and just-I see the negative sides in people and then I just focus on that more than the positive. And then I can't like get close to them, or whatever, you know. I value them ","P1-N400912":"less or-I don't know, or something. [pause] It's like quickly trying to evaluate, sort of like you're like in a supermarket and you're saying, "Oh yeah, that thing, that's that, and that thing has that qualities, and that one has that. Okay, so that one's an intellectual, this guy's an artist, that ","P1-N400913":"guy's a bohemian." So it's like, you know, all these categories, like name tags or categories that pop up in my head when I see things. [26:30]
THERAPIST: I would think so. Well, it depends on how you define trouble.
CLIENT: If you went through everyone you're just like-I don't know. [chuckles]
THERAPIST: Where were you going with that thought?
CLIENT: My bad thought. [laughs] The near slut. [laughs] So I don't know. We don't have to get that far. But I mean like-I don't know. That's what it feels like sometimes. Do you not forget who you are when you just keep running after other people? I guess you don't have to.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm not sure I understand the question. Do you forget who you are?
CLIENT: Really you don't.
THERAPIST: How would you forget who you are?
CLIENT: Yeah, I would. That's what I have to find out. I mean, earlier it was just me and Chris. Chris is, you know, who he is, he does this, this and this. And I was-I did this. [chuckles] Or tried to do this, you know, badly or whatever, unsuccessfully. But now-and then everyone else was-they had ","P1-N400A31":"their nice little categories, they're in the boxes.
THERAPIST: [sneezes] Excuse me.
CLIENT: Bless you.
THERAPIST: Thanks. [29:00]
CLIENT: Now I feel like some, you know, bomb has exploded and like all the categories and all the boxes, all the stuff is out of them. So I am in closer proximity with other people, other stuff. So in that sense things are not as neat, so there is that danger of me feeling lost a little bit, or homeless, ","P1-N400AB1":"or without my box, you know. But I mean-
THERAPIST: I didn't know your box wasn't [sic] that sturdy.
CLIENT: Yeah? You don't know, or-
THERAPIST: I don't think your box was that sturdy.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: This kind of box. Like aBecause it was always being, you know, broken down by other people's boxes.
CLIENT: Yeah?
THERAPIST: You felt like the box was very weak.
CLIENT: Hm.
THERAPIST: It's not like you had a nice comfortable safe category. You had a category that could be destroyed or questioned or-at any time. Demeaned, devalued.
CLIENT: By who?
THERAPIST: Well, by yourself, but what you perceive as other people. "Who are you? What are you doing here? You have no family." You know, "You don't have status in your world, you're just a silly writer."
CLIENT: Yeah. [pause] Yeah. [sighs] I don't know, I guess now the box feels more exploded, and I'm out there, and what do I do? I feel like my professor is giving me a raft, you know, to swim through this mess. Or not a mess, maybe it's a beautiful little river. [chuckles] And not to just like go like ","P1-N400C31":"this [some gesture], but to like open my eyes and poke around and like look at the things I'm passing by, and, you know, engage with them, and be like, "Okay, so you come from Chicago. Okay, tell me more. What has happened since the decline of the industry there?" You know, like, "What are your parents ","P1-N400C32":"like? What kind of childhood did you have? Where do you live now? What do you write about now?" I mean, this is the conversation that I was watching him have, you know, at a party. And I would never have done that, because I would be like, "Oh, okay then. Well, I don't know anything about it. Bye." ","P1-N400C33":"[chuckles] [32:00]
THERAPIST: So why would you have run away?
CLIENT: Because I would just feel so awkward about not know anything, and feeling like, okay, there is no point in having any discussion or conversation with this-I felt like again in a box. You know, he is in a box, I am in a box, and we're notBut, you know, I'm not in a box, I'm in a river, and ","P1-N400C71":"I have eyes, and I can, you know, use my senses to engage and interact. Not that being with Chris was like being in a box. I just perceived that it was like that. But when he says stuff like what he said today, like my judgment and my morals, I feel like that is a box. Is it a box?
THERAPIST: I have no idea what he was talking about or what you were talking about.
CLIENT: Or a lens?
THERAPIST: Sorry?
CLIENT: Or a lens maybe?
THERAPIST: I don't know-I mean, taking it out of context I don't know what that statement means.
CLIENT: I can't remember the context.
THERAPIST: I'm not blaming you, I'm just making a comment.
CLIENT: I'm thinking. I'm going to have to call him and ask him what he was saying. I don't know.
THERAPIST: Do you stay with him sometimes still?
CLIENT: Yeah. [chuckles] Is that weird? It is weird.
THERAPIST: Does it feel weird? [34:00]
CLIENT: Kind of... more stressful and, you know. But then like I'm fighting with myself obviously. And I don't want not to stay with him, because I feel like I get stuff out of it, you know, so... [long pause] I can't remember the context. [long pause] Was it a box, was it... Oh yeah, you said it wasn't ","P1-N400DF1":"a very sturdy box. But like, does being with Chris feel like a box? I guess it felt like a box, yeah. And when he says, you know, he has to have his judgments, then it feels like a box. Although maybe it's just a lens. It's not like he doesn't meet people, he does. I mean, he's a professor so obviously. ","P1-N400DF2":"[pause] And he continues to meet... Yeah, I don't know why I see a stark difference between him and maybe some other people. Maybe I see stark differences for my own convenience, it justifies things. I don't know. [pause] [37:30]
THERAPIST: Well, why do you think you do it?
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: Why do you think you do it?
CLIENT: I don't know.
THERAPIST: Well, on a-sort of a basic way of answering that question is because you want to.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know if I want [to]. [chuckles] I don't know. Sometimes I don't know. [pause] I guess I over think it and I'm like, "What the hell is this damn thing?" You know, like why do we do it? Why am I doing it, what does it mean? And does it get in the way of me doing other things and ","P1-N400ED1":"having other things? [long pause] Is it useful to think if I hadn't gone to Ohio, if I'd gone to Chris's instead, what would have happened? Where would I be today, how would I think?
THERAPIST: But that assumes that the event changed things, versus the way you are, the person you are who made that choice. It's not only Ohio it'sAnd since nothing changed, you continue to make choices like that. So you're responding to something inside you. I don't know why you think Ohio itself ","P1-N400EF1":"was the pivotal, I guess I don't understand. [41:00]
CLIENT: Yeah, I know, I see it as pivotal.
THERAPIST: Well, how was it pivotal? Like what did it change?
CLIENT: I feel like it opened like my thing of sleeping with other guys. [chuckles]
THERAPIST: Well, why wouldn't it just have happened in another circumstance?
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: The event didn't, you chose it. It was you who changed, the event didn't do anything.
CLIENT: Yeah. So if I had not gone to Ohio.
THERAPIST: But that's like saying if you had been a different person would things be different. You know, it's about you, it's not about the event, or even a choice in isolation.
CLIENT: Well, okay, so if I had-no, it's the same thing. [chuckles] So you're saying I should have-how else should I ask the question? What changed in me?
THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess what motivated you. Because saying what would have happened if I hadn't assumes that it's the event that defines it. Whereas you just continue to do similar things for months and months after, so it wasn't the event itself.
CLIENT: Yeah. But... But I mean, do I have-I don't know if my motivations are... I guess they were more like reactions, right. I was reacting to something.
THERAPIST: Perhaps. But then-but you're-I guess you continue to do similar things. So it's just not-it's not isolated.
CLIENT: Oh, I see.
THERAPIST: You know, it's-that's why I see it more as about who you are and not about the event. [43:00]
CLIENT: Hm. Who am I then? [chuckles] [pause]
THERAPIST: Well, I think you're very confused.
CLIENT: [chuckles] About what?
THERAPIST: About everything.
CLIENT: Hm. About what I want and stuff. [pause]
THERAPIST: Maybe this leads back to the beginning of the session where you said, "Oh, I just don't want to deal with this today."
CLIENT: Yeah. What do you mean, like I'm being facetious today, or [unclear 44:22].
THERAPIST: No, I don't think you're being facetious, but there's a way in which you just, "I don't really want to think about this."
CLIENT: I'm trying to think.
THERAPIST: I know you are.
CLIENT: [chuckles] Well. [pause] I guess... [sighs] I don't know. I know I'm confused, but what do I do with that? How do I untangle myself, and how do I sort out the confusion? [pause]
THERAPIST: My guess is-this is a little bit of an odd way of putting it, but in a sense you have to want to. I mean, you have to want to not live like this anymore. "I don't want to do this. I need to do something else."
CLIENT: Yeah. But I don't see it as like-there's no fire under my ass, you know, wanting to...
THERAPIST: Well, right.
CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like I have to like accept certain things about myself, such as the fact that I'm confused. And it'll take-it won't like-I'm not the sort of person who can snap and be like the next day be like, "Yeah, this is not for me," and change. So I can let-I mean, this will take a while, ","P1-N401291":"months, years. Hopefully not too long, but... [46:20]
THERAPIST: But I guess as we're talking I feel like there is a way-and not in all areas of your life for sure-but there's a way in which you can be quite passive in relationship to your life. Like sort of letting things happen, things happen, things unfold.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And not feeling like an agent in that. Like you make things happen, you make decisions.
CLIENT: That sounds like my mom.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Don't you think?
THERAPIST: That was my thought.
CLIENT: Well, I'd like to be active and an agent. I feel like that's-you know, stepping down the relationship in this weird way [chuckles] was taking agency, you know.
THERAPIST: I think that's true.
CLIENT: That's why I don't like to look at it in a completely negative light.
THERAPIST: Look at what in a negative light?
CLIENT: Stepping out of the relationship.
THERAPIST: I don't think you looked at it in a negative light at all actually.
CLIENT: Well, I do.
THERAPIST: Because I hear you talking about it in terms of feeling like you want to sort of grow or develop or explore, or feel like you have your own space where you can take care of yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So I maybe hear less about the negative light part.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I guess this week I've tried to look at it in a negative light. Something like, "Oh, what'll I do," you know. "What have I started?"
THERAPIST: What have you started, what do you mean?
CLIENT: With the Ohio thing, going to Ohio.
THERAPIST: You're seeing what you're doing now in relation to that?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I see. I guess I wasn't understanding that connection.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That you're walking away from something good?
CLIENT: Stable. Secure. The whole box thing. [chuckles]
THERAPIST: Well, we're going to need to stop for today.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: [inaudible] I will see you on Monday.
CLIENT: Yeah, see you. Have a good weekend.
THERAPIST: Thank you. Take care, Cecelia. [49:00]
