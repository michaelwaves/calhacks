DESCRIPTION: Client discusses how she feels about her current romantic relationship. Client also discusses her lack of success in her career and how it has an impact on her desire and self-esteem.
THERAPIST: What do you feel weird about? [00:02:21]
CLIENT: Just generally I feel kind of anxious and insecure and stuff. I don't really I feel like I'm going around in circles. (chuckle) I feel anxious to get what I want and like I don't know exactly how to get it I suppose. (pause) [00:03:38]
THERAPIST: What are the clouds? What are they made of?
CLIENT: I don't know. They're just I just meant them just like metaphorical.
THERAPIST: But there's some the clouds there's some meaning to them, something in your way, or something obscuring vision, or I don't know.
CLIENT: You know, I just feel like yeah, upset, to say the same things over and over again, so it is and then there's the burden of things to do and it's the issues and that just feels too much some some days. But I guess some days I feel more confident and nurtured and protected and encouraged, ","P1-N400171":"and then some days I don't, obviously (chuckle), so those days I feel more uncertain and it's a lot of work to feel, to not feel negative things, or maybe I don't even try and I just keep feeling them (chuckle). [00:06:18]
THERAPIST: Bless you.
CLIENT: Thank you. (pause) What do you think (chuckle)?
THERAPIST: About what? [00:12:39]
CLIENT: I don't know, it's like you could slap me or something, but snap me out of this coma that I feel like I'm in sometimes. Maybe it's (inaudible). Insecurity coma, like, food coma (inaudible). I cook so much.
THERAPIST: Yeah, food coma is usually when you eat too much, isn't that what?
CLIENT: Yeah, but I think it should be more in my case like insecurity coma. Other people come over, have eaten too much of other people and I'm like "Ah, I have nothing for myself, (inaudible)." I get very easily influenced on (inaudible). But then when I'm like, "OK, I'm going to work on my (inaudible)," ","P1-N400331":"and I have no idea how to do that. [00:13:37]
THERAPIST: Were you upset by Chris's (ph) saying again that he thinks you should break up?
CLIENT: Well, I just felt insecure. I mean, obviously, all this is brought on by my own doing, you know. It's not like he initiated. He wouldn't. He would never (chuckle), would be fine just coasting along. So, but I mean, I know that rationally, but you know, like still a little secure about, you know, ","P1-N400391":"money, well mostly money. [00:14:43]
THERAPIST: That was interesting. You said, "I think."
CLIENT: Yeah, well, like there's, you know, he's, you know, over the year it's hard to (inaudible) it's been so many years, but like, yeah, he's sharp the way he thinks. Obviously going to, certainly must have influenced me, but I'm also very like protective of, (inaudible) when I think about what I ","P1-N4003F1":"work, it's all, you know, my material. [00:15:38]
THERAPIST: Thrive more?
CLIENT: No, just ...
THERAPIST: Thrive relative to ...?
CLIENT: No, more relative to think, just (inaudible) and stay alive, and be happy and work and be successful. [00:18:42]
THERAPIST: Do you feel like you're thriving now? I guess that's what I was wondering.
CLIENT: I don't know. I thought I was. I thought I was, like I'm getting some momentum on my work, and like getting the piece accepted, but now this negative voice in my head is telling me, "You don't you just have to (inaudible)." That's what success (inaudible). I'm just like, "Don't say that." ","P1-N400511":"Because like they, even when they haven't met me, they said they liked the piece. Like they said all they liked the piece. [00:19:32]
THERAPIST: Well we started by, well I had asked about the issue of thriving.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yes, I mean, even this makes me feel kind of strong, I don't know how you felt when I was talking, but it's like it makes me feel resourceful, you know? Sure, there are negative connotations, but at least I'm doing something, you know, effective and aggressive maybe. I wasn't aggressive ","P1-N4005D1":"more, right? I pimp my web design skills. That was pretty aggressive. I was like, you can design your whole race on your own website. [00:22:36]
THERAPIST: It's your framing of it that's interesting. Yeah, you have pimping, people pimping themselves out.
CLIENT: (inaudible). See, do you have any other interpretation of asking for a blow job (chuckle)?
THERAPIST: Not in that case, no.
CLIENT: Yeah (chuckle).
THERAPIST: But you do see relationships and interactions as exploitative (sic) in many ways.
CLIENT: Yeah. Sure. As opposed to ...?
THERAPIST: That's my point. You just made my point.
CLIENT: Oh. You mean like mutual and like cooperative?
THERAPIST: Whatever bullshit.
CLIENT: No, I mean sure, there's room for positive kind of equal interactions (chuckle). [00:23:40]
THERAPIST: But the image of you being a flea on a dog which is Chris (ph) is you could sort of put that paradigm in a lot of plug it in in a lot of relationship a lot of how you feel in different relationships. I think at times your mother is a flea and you're the dog.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I think in the past you felt that Chris (ph) was the flea and you were the dog when he wasn't earning any money.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Like yeah. At other times I see that I helped him. But you're right. Like at those times, it's not that I'm thinking, "Oh, this is mutual and this is like beautiful." I'm actually thinking, does that have been helpful when he hasn't helped, and then other times, when I don't ","P1-N4007B1":"think like that, it's not like "Oh, it's mutual." It's again like OK, I've been the bloodsucker and he's been the provider. [00:24:40]
THERAPIST: I've been the bloodsucker and he's been sucked dry of his blood.
CLIENT: But he does look quite dry, so it doesn't help.
THERAPIST: So the question is, did you contribute to that?
CLIENT: I sometimes think that yes, I do it. But, you know, I think I don't think that's really true. If I think about it, instead of feeling about it. I do think that I mean, he's been quite capable of taking care of himself and if he weren't he wouldn't have gotten where he is right now. Me, on ","P1-N400851":"the other hand, I just feel before I think, you know? [00:25:36]
THERAPIST: You're not sure where your motivation should come from?
CLIENT: Yeah, I'm not sure where it actually comes from (chuckle). I should know this by now, right? I suppose I feel motivation motivated when like I think about my material. That just really makes me motivated. Because I do feel very strongly about some of these things, and, yeah. Once I put this ","P1-N4009F1":"(inaudible), I'm so frustrated. I'm sorry. I put these aside, and just focus on material and not think about other people and how they're judging me, then I'm OK, you know? [00:34:14]
THERAPIST: What I compare myself to him?
CLIENT: Yeah. How would you feel?
THERAPIST: Well I'd be scared because he's dead.
CLIENT: Well, barring that it were possible for people to come alive.
THERAPIST: Well, if I felt intimidated, I mean, I think it would be awesome, but if I felt intimidated, that would imply that I put myself in the same categories, that I would see myself as my own unique category.
CLIENT: Just a category and not like like a hierarchy? [00:37:03]
THERAPIST: Well to have a hierarchy, you need to category. If you're in a different category, if you say, what's the best vegetable, and it's a steak, well the steak's feelings isn't going to get hurt. The steak's feelings aren't going to get hurt anyway, because the steak doesn't have feelings, but ","P1-N400B31":"the steak's feelings aren't going to get hurt because it's not a vegetable, it's a different category.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So, even if there are hierarchies, if you feel yourself to be a different category. But I think even that, people could be a running race. I like to run, so, but, you know, you could come in even last, but if you had a better time than you've ever had, it's it's still a huge accomplishment. [00:37:58]
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I don't know why I get that way. (chuckle). [00:39:19]
CLIENT: I certainly do. Very frequently, for long periods. It's become like a defining thing because of you know, being with Chris (ph).
THERAPIST: Maybe it's but you also choose Chris (ph) because of your own it's not Chris's (ph) doing. Chris (ph) may have influenced it, but (inaudible) it's sort of a reinforcing cycle.
CLIENT: How do you break the cycle (chuckle)?
THERAPIST: Don't you feel like you're already breaking it?
CLIENT: How?
THERAPIST: You don't feel you are? [00:40:07]
CLIENT: Sometimes it feels like there's been a break, a chink in the chain, but not like not all the time. Certainly not right now (chuckle).
THERAPIST: I've seen you in these moods or these states before.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Where you want to crawl in a hole and hide, and hope everything goes away when you come out.
CLIENT: (chuckle) Yes.
THERAPIST: You don't want to change, you're hoping that everything else will change when you re-emerge (inaudible).
CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. But I know the change has to be here, just I lapse, I guess. [00:41:03]
THERAPIST: How often do you work?
CLIENT: When I have time. At least like three days a week, but I should, the days I am not working I should wake up early and least try and work one hour (inaudible). I feel like I should have a stronger (inaudible). Don't know how to make it stronger. What are the exercises I should be doing every ","P1-N400DB1":"day? It's (inaudible) weak right now because it keeps lapsing. I don't know. Other than working, what are the other things I should do? [00:42:08]
THERAPIST: We are going to need to stop today, so on Monday I'll see you at 9:15, just next Monday. OK. Take care. Have a good rest of the week.
CLIENT: You, too. Are you running in the Boston Marathon?
THERAPIST: No, mostly watching. Bye. Thank you. [00:42:44]
