DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the legal and moral principles he tries to live by, and his issues with attempting to understand other people when they break social and legal rules. Discusses his monetary difficulties with the health insurance company not reimbursing him for his therapist payments.
CLIENT: Good morning.
THERAPIST: Morning.
CLIENT: So I'm not exactly sure, oh I've got a check for you, (inaudible).
THERAPIST: Oh, thank you.
CLIENT: Sorry.
THERAPIST: Thank you.
CLIENT: So I'm not exactly sure about what to talk about today, but I guess I have four general categories that are fanatic, or something, but how do people live with depressed partners? What are our obligations in relationships, both like that and more generally? I have more, but, oh, why am I angry, ","P1-N400171":"and what do what do I do about it?
THERAPIST: Yeah. Because they all seem interesting, so I'm going to see where you go with it.
CLIENT: It's a question of how do people live with depressed partners? I don't know that I have any answer, we'll just do and then people don't. Several of my good friends have dated or been engaged to people who had some sort of depression or anxiety disorder or somewhere in the spectrum of both, and ","P1-N4001F1":"all of those relationships have ended, so after years in, well a year in one case, and years in the other case, but so it's kind of like it works for awhile, and then doesn't. That's all I have on that subject, because I don't have the answers, it was a question. [00:02:48]
THERAPIST: Well certainly that your personal statistic has some meaning for you.
CLIENT: The largest meaning it has is I don't know how to take it. They're both good friends, and I like both of them a whole lot, and I respect both of them and so I have as much confidence as I can have they did the right thing for themselves, and I'm not sure that there's much more to say than that ","P1-N400231":"other than like what's right for them is not necessarily applicable to my situation at all. [00:04:00]
THERAPIST: Well, they don't want to pay their taxes. That's why they're doing it.
CLIENT: Yeah, but I don't want to pay the taxes either, right? I would rather I would have the money than the federal government have it because they're pretty ineffective at spending money in a useful fashion. They're just inefficient at everything they do, even if they're aiming at the right things. [00:11:08]
THERAPIST: So that is an interesting question, because they don't want to pay their taxes, you don't want to pay your taxes, and yet you do and not all of them are within that system, so then the question is, what's the difference? I guess that's what you're asking or pointing out.
CLIENT: Yeah, something like that, yeah. You know, again, it's very clear to me that there are certain legal obligations and that we have moral obligations to meet our legal obligations, except under certain circumstances like conscientious objection. [00:12:00]
THERAPIST: Libertarians might, Libertarians might.
CLIENT: Sure. As might anarchists in the light, not blowing things up since because I mean, they fall in the same spectrum at that point. But, but I really think that what that person has to be arguing at that point is that the system that we have is not the right system. [00:12:59]
THERAPIST: But that's a big problem, because there's a lot of things we've talked about that are unacceptable, and then what do you do about them? Which is maybe the anger part. What do you do with the feelings?
CLIENT: (pause) So far, for crossing the streets, the only answer I have is I try not to hold onto any anger that gets generated in the moment and to cross the streets the way I think is appropriate. You know, if I think there's a clear sort of system-optimal thing to do, I should do that. [00:18:14]
THERAPIST: Yeah, but of course that's not the problem. I mean, of course that's an excuse for, "I don't want to do this." [00:21:04]
CLIENT: Yeah, so in that second case, what happens if you take away the lack of clarity.
THERAPIST: Then they have a choice as to whether they do what seems the right thing to do from a social contractual point of view, or do what they want to do that serves their own personal interest.
CLIENT: Right. So basically, I have to make that choice explicit.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, I make less a distinction between implicit and explicit choices, not seeking out information to make a choice is making a choice. I don't make as big a distinction. [00:22:11]
CLIENT: OK. I'm not sure exactly how to scale that up, because we can't seek out all the information to make every decision.
THERAPIST: That's true. The example you gave is so circumscribed, though.
CLIENT: OK, OK. I wasn't sure if you were trying to make a more general claim or not.
THERAPIST: It'd be interesting to try to scale out, it's interesting in itself whether you can make more general claims. That's interesting, I hadn't thought of that at that point. [00:22:57]
CLIENT: It certainly becomes a problem, so I think that when most students are deciding where to go to school, they do not have and cannot have enough information to make the actually optimal decision. I think because the time scale of school is so long, that they can make the best decision for the ","P1-N400711":"moment, but it's really hard to make the best decision for them across five or eight years. And so, but I don't think (inaudible) would say they're willfully making the wrong choice or something like that.
THERAPIST: I mean, the decision for school, judging what would be best for them or what would be the best?
CLIENT: Yeah, so given a set of schools that one could attend, which one is the best one to attend?
THERAPIST: There's just too many, right? They are (inaudible). That seems like so many variables. [00:24:02]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Do you feel like when people like, they know they should pay this tax, but they just don't, does it is it hard to understand? Like is it just, "how could you possibly do that?" Is it, what's it feel like, or what's the thought?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, no, the feeling's something like so there was the confusion which I think you've clarified, because they just don't want to. How could you not read this tax and understand it? Like these are presumably bright people, they're Brown graduate students that, the language is very simple. ","P1-N4007D1":"It's not like some of the tax code, and it's actually like an explanation of the tax code, so it's so there's the confusion like ... I mean, I remember being confused about what I was supposed to do about scholarships and fellowships, so it's not confusion about it that's difficult, it's the like ","P1-N4007D2":"failing to find a clear answer. [00:25:06]
THERAPIST: Well that's what I was asking, is that piece.
CLIENT: See, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I so don't understand that that I keep looking for something else, and then I'm more confused. OK, I don't understand, I think, the idea of this is what I ought to do, I'm just not going to do it because I don't want to. Except under specific circumstances, ","P1-N400851":"so I understand that so the essence of depression is a lack of the necessary will to do what one ought to do. [00:27:07]
THERAPIST: Really?
CLIENT: Maybe not had to know, I think that felt sort of like it was a question leading to that answer, that's a more accurate (inaudible). You were really just curious.
THERAPIST: No, I actually, I wasn't actually, yeah, I was curious. I wasn't sure how you would think about it. Did it seem like it should be more obvious to me?
CLIENT: Not in any essential sense, only in the sense of like I thought that from the specific question you chose, I thought you had a specific reading of me that would make that the answer. [00:29:15]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean one thing I was seeing as a sort of a thought, I mean I think that's especially important as a follow-up, is sort of like when I said, when you were talking about, you know, in terms of training students and feeling sort of morally challenged by that, you know, given the options ","P1-N400951":"they have that, and I just lost my train of thought going to that. That a lot of people's behavior will be confusing and kind of frustrating, because lots of people don't, you know, ignore rules and regulations and do what they want. So I would imagine that life's throwing you lot of a series of frustrations ","P1-N400952":"on that matter. It happens all the time. [00:30:03]
CLIENT: It really does, yeah. I don't really know, really know what to do about it.
THERAPIST: I can see that. No, I mean, this is important.
CLIENT: Yeah, well I think it's important, but clearly not everyone does, right? But maybe you meant like it's important to me, how I deal with it.
THERAPIST: It's important how you deal with it, how you're taking it in and dealing with it. Do you feel like your family very much lives by this, like in terms of the guiding principles should always be what you ought to do?
CLIENT: I think so. Yeah, I feel like I read books sometimes where the families have very clear guiding principles, and they're talked about explicitly. I don't feel like there's any big talk. of we ought to do this because it's the right thing to do. It's just kind of much more (inaudible). [00:31:17]
THERAPIST: No you didn't. [00:35:03]
CLIENT: Well I talked (inaudible) remember why I started. But I think it had to do with how my family approaches the world.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, I, yeah, I guess one question is that I was thinking like, what does it mean that people do things that they want to do versus the right thing? Like what happens, or what ...
CLIENT: Traffic jams happen. I'm sorry, it was sort of a ...
THERAPIST: No, that's a good (inaudible).
CLIENT: I mean, the way to get out of traffic jams is to, like the system-optimal way, as far as I can tell, is to open up following distance and speed up only slowly coming out of a traffic jam. Because the most frequent thing I see happen is lanes contract, it's a traffic jam because two-way cars ","P1-N400B71":"go too fast, too little space. [00:35:59]
THERAPIST: There's (inaudible) non sequitur, but I don't think it is. But the more I bring it up, and I'm bringing it up now for me because I think it follows. You know, you could ask me to pay, you can ask to pay me when you start getting reimbursed, you know that? You could, as an option.
CLIENT: Well, thank you.
THERAPIST: But maybe that's, but actually, that's, when I say it's an option, maybe that's something that we talk about, should talk about too, because maybe it doesn't feel like an option. [00:39:01]
CLIENT: Well, it's complicated in a lot of ways. I'm not really sure which way to approach it. (pause) Yeah, maybe I should just start, let's take that, so in one way, we have a very strange relationship that is complicated for me already, because what we sort of have conversations, like we talk, but ","P1-N400C51":"there's a clear limit to like, or I assume there's a limit that I'm not supposed to cross. [00:40:16]
THERAPIST: (inaudible) put that into place, but ...
CLIENT: Yeah, no, I don't think you have. But that's because I think there is a norm there. That is what I have that is my understanding from other people who have therapeutic relationships, and so I have attempted not to violate that norm without making you (inaudible). That's because that if I know ","P1-N400CB1":"the norm is there, then I don't need you to say it. Does that make sense? Now, if it turns out that that norm is not there for you, then that is its own complicating thing, and then I have made a mistake in aiming for some sort of optimality. [00:41:10]
THERAPIST: How is that, so that's, well that's just sort of (inaudible) actually have more financial burden it looks like, and how is that piece complicated for us?
CLIENT: Oh, because I assume that there are sort of like system-wide norms for therapeutic relationships, and so ... [00:44:15]
THERAPIST: I wonder if it's safer. I was thinking about this, a thought that came to my mind is I wonder if in some ways it's limiting, but safer that way, rather to think of (inaudible) each therapist as their own, sort of (inaudible) entity, then there's some, certainly we just don't do whatever the ","P1-N400D71":"hell we want, but that we serve our own norms and values and so forth, and we each practice very differently, and, you know, have different ways of thinking, you know, differences about, you know, that somehow that that I mean in some ways, on the one side that I imagine can be very freeing, but on ","P1-N400D72":"the other side maybe even scarier that there's so much variability.
CLIENT: Well, certainly you remember I was reluctant to find a different therapist. [00:45:12]
THERAPIST: Yeah, there's something about the assumptions that are, they are preferring or (inaudible) with assumptions, rather than asking or talking about it. And it very much relates to this issue of obligations. [00:47:05]
CLIENT: I appreciate that offer. I don't. So the health insurance company keeps misprocessing it and then Tanya will call and they'll misprocess it again, so I don't know whether it's better or worse to add more people to the calling the health insurance company, so like, you know, they ...
THERAPIST: It's up to you. I'm not going to do anything at this point, but it's never worse. It may not be better, but adding more, it's not like another problem-solving where you don't want too many chefs in the kitchen. Insurance doesn't work that way. It's a matter of, simply a matter of force that ","P1-N400EB1":"if there's enough forces, sometimes, it's not an it's not as sophisticated as people being orchestrated or working together. [00:49:00]
CLIENT: Thanks. I will think about it and let you know.
THERAPIST: OK.
CLIENT: Thanks.
THERAPIST: I have some time set, block. I will see you next week. Take care.
CLIENT: You too. [00:49:22]
