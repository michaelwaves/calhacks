DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her low self-esteem and how she feels insecure in relationships when she perceived that the balance of power is off.
CLIENT: I fell down on Monday when I was running. So it kind of—it made me a little sad. [chuckles] A [peaceful? 6:50] injury. It’s not that bad, but I just felt low because of it. [pause]
THERAPIST: Low how?
CLIENT: I don’t know, just sad and depressed.
THERAPIST: Because you fell?
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know, I was like, “Oh, I’m doing so well with our running.” And I won’t be able to for like a few days or something. I don’t know. It was like God was trying to punish me or something, whatever. I mean, I guess I was curious why like a small ","P1-N400151":"physical injury can affect my mood. But it did. It shouldn’t, you know. [pause] And my mom came right over and helped me. So it’s not like—you know, it’s not even like a sign of all our blues. I guess it’s maybe I’m also sad because of other things. Like I didn’t ","P1-N400152":"hear back from this guy, so I was just—that made me think. And now I’m like, I don’t think I’m ready for a relationship. Or definitely not a new relationship.
THERAPIST: I’m sorry, you didn’t hear back. I’m not understanding the context, you didn’t hear back from a guy?
CLIENT: This new guy.
THERAPIST: You didn’t hear back from him from when? I don’t understand. [9:00]
CLIENT: Oh, no. So he work—he goes to Ohio during the week and comes back on the weekend. And I don’t know, just—we don’t talk on the phone, so that makes me anxious or insecure.
THERAPIST: But it sounds like—you didn’t hear back, it’s like you called him and he hasn’t called you back, is that what you mean?
CLIENT: No, no.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: I just didn’t hear from him on Monday and so I just felt insecure. Yeah. I just kept thinking, “Oh, I’m not a priority,” and, you know. Despite, you know, I [texting him? 9:46], “You know, even if you’re busy you can kind of find the time to send a text or ","P1-N400251":"something.” I don’t know. I just kept—keep on [bearing and go back to?] my previous relationships where we were talking on the phone all the time and we were very connected. So I’m like why—I don’t think it would [throw that off?], that connection, that love. [pause] [10:30]
THERAPIST: I don’t know. It was your experience. [14:00]
CLIENT: Yeah, but like I don’t know, how do you understand it, like what I said to them? Was I experiencing power by association, or…
THERAPIST: You were putting them down.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I don’t know if that’s power by association.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because that’s not power. People don’t humiliate people if they feel powerful. You don’t need—if you really feel powerful you don’t need to humiliate people.
CLIENT: Yeah, I almost like—I wish I could understand it. I’m just so ashamed of it that I don’t— I haven’t even tried to understand it. [pause] Well, what did I mean, “You have to be able to construct, own, purchase a bungalow,” anyway? What did that mean when ","P1-N400391":"I said that? Was I feeling good about myself? Was I feeling insecure? What was it? [long pause] Yeah, I need adjectives. I need them for understanding this. [16:00]
THERAPIST: Why do you feel—like are you in a mental block? Or what’s happening?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Like if someone else would tell me, “This is what you were feeling,” and then I can accept their definition, or their feeling about it. Not just blindly accept it, but you know, understand it myself. Then I feel like I can maybe start to forgive myself for that and like put it behind ","P1-N400411":"me or something.
THERAPIST: What would you be forgiving yourself for?
CLIENT: For whatever it is that I did that I don’t even understand what I was doing. You know. I have not thought about it in this, you know, constructive way. [pause] Maybe I was trying to impress someone? Myself? My friend? Maybe I thought that that’s what she wanted to hear. Or maybe ","P1-N400451":"there was a choice for me, or like either identify with the outsider or the insider, and I at that moment chose to remain inside. I mean, it was a disguise. [18:00]
THERAPIST: It was a disguise?
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean like it was a lie. I mean, they didn’t know who I was, right. They were strangers, they didn’t know who I was. I could have been anyone. I mean, I stepped out of the bungalow. Who was to say that I didn’t live there and own the whole damn thing, you know? No one. ","P1-N400491":"I mean, when I walk out, how are they going to know that I’m living in the small little hovel in it, or the entire place, you know? [pause] So I had like a choice I suppose. I wish I’d remember the whole fucking episode, that would help. But I don’t. But all I can do is guess, and ","P1-N400492":"all I can guess is that they probably were soliciting. You know, they were probably like they wanted to perform or something, so that we would give them money, or you know. And we didn’t let them in, or we didn’t let them talk to our parents, or you know. And that— Yeah. Should I keep ","P1-N400493":"going or more on, move away?
THERAPIST: You’re having a hard time taking charge of the session today.
CLIENT: [chuckles] Yeah.
THERAPIST: It seems like you’re wanting direction.
CLIENT: Yes. [laughs] Is that what you expect, you expect me to take charge? [20:00]
THERAPIST: That question is [weird?].
CLIENT: [chuckles]
THERAPIST: It’s like you’re feeling very insecure.
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I go through—I go through phases like. But yeah, going back to that, like that’s what I can think of, that maybe I wanted to remain inside, I wanted to feel for once what it was like to pretend, you know. Because here was like complete strangers seeing me with the rest ","P1-N400591":"of the kids. Who knows? I mean, maybe I was wrong, maybe they already could tell that I didn’t belong with the rest of them because maybe my clothes were different. I don’t even know if they were that different. But maybe they were. Or maybe they weren’t and I thought I could be anyone, ","P1-N400592":"whatever I wanted to, and I could be rich, you know, like my friend.
THERAPIST: I don’t know what it was that you feel you did wrong, I’m not sure.
CLIENT: Well, I feel very bad about it, so—
THERAPIST: You feel you insulted them or put them down, is that it?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Like I feel horrible about myself that I could do such a thing. Like I feel like a hypocrite, or you know. And a liar, and you know. Yeah, anyone who puts the downtrodden down is like the biggest evildoer in my books, you know. So. I mean, I can—as a writer I can see the gray, ","P1-N400631":"and you know, I can identify with the wrongdoer, evildoer. But when it comes down to a black and white thing, you know, right and wrong, that’s the quick judgment I would make is that that’s wrong, you know. I guess I must have wanted approval so badly in that moment that I just—the ","P1-N400632":"words just came out. [pause]
THERAPIST: Well, it’s hard if you feel power by association is against someone.
CLIENT: Yeah. [pause] Well, when people have power it’s like, “Okay, so when are you going to abuse it?” You know, like. And that’s what I’m thinking. Like when I was with my women’s group last week—I think it was last weekend—and I had that kind of flare ","P1-N400691":"up for whatever convoluted reasons, maybe that was also what I think, that when I see everyone that’s being so big and powerful, and me being so small. I guess maybe I place myself in that position of the one that they can harm because of their power. I don’t know.
THERAPIST: I think it was still multi-determined. Because absolutely the way these children treated you had an impact on how you feel. But, you know, certainly your dad contributed to it too in terms of feeling kind of lonely and humiliated and hence wanting to lash out on others, and I think your mom ","P1-N4006F1":"felt that way too. So you were already predisposed to that kind of feeling that way, and then it was just sort of intensified by the way you were treated by these kids.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean, another way of looking at it too is kids are very good at picking up each other’s vulnerabilities, and that may have been something that they saw in you.
CLIENT: Yeah. [pause] It’s kind of scary. [30:00]
THERAPIST: How so?
CLIENT: Just like their whole life was just going to pass, you know. I mean, I was thinking this last night coming back from class. Like I’m thinking, why do I always focus on the negative? Why do always focus on what I don’t have? You know, because there is actually no way that you can ","P1-N400791":"build a life if you think of what you don’t have. Most of the stuff—all of life is all about building on what you already have, you know. And like specifically in terms of writing, writing is all about that. You start with a small idea, but you build on it. You have a draft and it’s ","P1-N400792":"messy, then you revise it, revise it, revise it. You don’t just write ten different stories in the first draft. No one does that. And all of life is all about that, relationships, you know. Like you don’t just toss them out. You fix things.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: [chuckles] Like really being chewed slowly, very, very slowly, but being chewed nonetheless. I hated all my stuff because of them. And I think children go through that I guess. You know, like they compare—that’s when they start first comparing, and saying, “Those shoes are ","P1-N400831":"really better,” and all that. [pause] I mean, of course I don’t—to some extent I don’t do that. You know, like I have good pretty things and people like them and I feel good about them. But then I think in much more like deeper ways is how I experience this, that I don’t ","P1-N400832":"have anything and they have everything. It doesn’t come down to shoes and clothes and dolls, but it comes to other things now I guess. [very long pause, over 2 minutes] [39:00]
THERAPIST: People who put you down.
CLIENT: [pause] Yeah. I don’t know if I seek them, right. I don’t know. You’re thinking, am I trying to replace my dad?
THERAPIST: [Yeah?]. Interesting. [pause] [40:00]
CLIENT: I mean, I guess I seek the company of people who have more. I guess that’s a fair statement. I wouldn’t say I seek the company of people who have less. And then you could even say, why do you even look at things that way, have more, have less, people are just people. I mean, this ","P1-N4008D1":"is obviously subconsciously, it’s not like consciously it’s—maybe it is conscious, I don’t know. I mean, I sought—I don’t know if I sought. But like my first boyfriend I’m thinking, you know, he was just an average guy. And there was no like have more, have ","P1-N4008D2":"less. It turned out that he had, you know, this, this and this. Some of it was very useful to me, you know, like the fact that he knew how to drive and fix cars. [chuckles] But he—yeah, he was average. I don’t think I sought him out because he had more. Initially it was just that, you know, ","P1-N4008D3":"he was cute and, you know, he was funny, and we had some chemistry, and that was that. [41:40]
THERAPIST: What do you think?
CLIENT: I don’t know, I guess in the abstract, like to just generalize, like do I like it when people put me down? I don’t know. I don’t think so. I mean, it is more intense, right, it’s more personal. So I like intense and personal. But it’s weird to think that I get turned ","P1-N400951":"on by that, or like—you know, not even turned on, but you know, like I seek it out. But maybe I think that they will help me grow. Not the fact that they put me down, but maybe that they’re able—the constructive criticism. And if not even that then just the fact that they have something ","P1-N400952":"I don’t really, open my eyes to something new. So.
THERAPIST: Do you still spend a lot of time with him?
CLIENT: Yeah. Not that much really. But yeah, I do see him like four or five days a week, but like just for a few hours.
THERAPIST: That’s a lot of time. It’s all relative, but.
CLIENT: Yeah, but I mean he’s working during the day, I’m working during the day, and yeah.
THERAPIST: We’re going to need to stop.
CLIENT: Oh, sorry.
THERAPIST: No need to apologize.
CLIENT: Okay. [47:00]
THERAPIST: I will see you on Monday.
CLIENT: Yes, see you.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Have a good weekend.
THERAPIST: Thank you very much.
CLIENT: I totally lost track of time.
THERAPIST: Take care.
CLIENT: Thank you.
