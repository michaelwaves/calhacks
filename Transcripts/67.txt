DESCRIPTION: Client discusses is curiosity in his therapist's pregnancy and her personal life. Client discusses his fears, including that of intimacy and trust in regards to his marriage.
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in. (PAUSE)
CLIENT: Are you uncomfortable with me sitting in this chair?
THERAPIST: No. I’m fine.
CLIENT: Okay. I am uncomfortable with it which is why I’m doing it?
THERAPIST: Yeah? What made you decide to? (PAUSE)
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) That’s a question I’m not sure I can answer. But I can give you the reasons that I’m uncomfortable with it. It’s about a foot closer to you. There’s no stool between the chairs. (PAUSE) I guess I’m... (PAUSE) I asked if you were uncomfortable with ","P1-N400151":"it because I’m also uncomfortable with the idea that you might be uncomfortable with it because I’m moving closer to you. So I think I worry that that might feel threatening or something like that. [00:01:15]
THERAPIST: Threatening how?
CLIENT: Uh... (PAUSE) (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) I’m not sure. Not sure. (PAUSE) [00:02:00]
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: And I don’t know really how to answer it. So, you know, sitting here and staring at a question is probably not going to get us somewhere. So... Have you been married before?
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: Okay. Have you been pregnant before?
THERAPIST: I’m happy to explore the questions but I’m curious about how many... There’s more now than... [00:03:07]
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:03:09)
THERAPIST: Well, yeah. Not only that there’s a lot but that it’s a pretty shift. And so clearly there’s something on your mind that you’re thinking about and working, trying to work out. (PAUSE)
CLIENT: You mean, it’s a big shift from me not asking questions to asking questions?
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: Okay. (PAUSE) (LAUGHTER) Um... (PAUSE) So I am and have been for most of the time that I’ve been seeing you very curious about you and I guess I... I don’t... I have a hard time saying whether I’m more curious now than I have been before. [00:04:11]
THERAPIST: Well, I’m wondering also if my pregnancy is also sort of further stimulating your curiosity.
CLIENT: (SIGH) (PAUSE) It is another thing to be curious about. (PAUSE) But I... (PAUSE) Yeah. I’m not sure. My feeling is that it’s more coincidental timewise because about the same time I found out that, that you told me that you were pregnant, we were talking about my feelings for you ","P1-N400391":"and so it’s sort of all like... [00:07:11]
THERAPIST: Well... It’s so... In theory, I live somewhere, right. My pregnancy is so conspicuous and it’s not a theory.
CLIENT: Yeah. But also like you live somewhere but your house is very personal and not that personal at the same time in some ways. But maybe that is just a feature of the conspicuousness. I don’t know. (PAUSE) [00:08:00]
THERAPIST: And knowing these things about me, is there sort of a feeling that that way you’ll feel closer to me? What are your thoughts about that?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
THERAPIST: And is that... I mean, there, it’s more nuanced to it than this. But is that the goal, in a sense?
CLIENT: (SIGH) It’s a goal. I don’t want to say it’s the only goal because it’s also like the practice of doing it seems to be an important thing. So that’s a goal. But there’s also just like I am curious. I don’t know why I’m curious. I just am curious. ","P1-N400491":"So does that make sense at all? [00:08:57]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, I think though the question for us to think about as so why... I mean, not that why puts it as if there’s something wrong with it. I don’t mean why in a bad sense. But just like what does it mean why?
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Well...
THERAPIST: Because it means a lot clearly. (PAUSE)
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) So I... (PAUSE) Yeah. I don’t know. I’m more or less always curious like about almost everything. So it’s like... (PAUSE) I’m not sure if you mean to be asking the question “why is that.”
THERAPIST: Maybe. [00:10:01]
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Okay. And I really don’t know about that. I feel like you’re asking the more specific question of why am I curious about you or these particular things is important which I think is a very reasonable question. But I sort of can’t separate from the other one of like ","P1-N400551":"why am I generally curious. I like to know things. I... (PAUSE) I think usually, “I find it interesting,” is a sufficient answer for, “why are you curious about that thing.” I realize that’s not the case here. It seems like there are other important things too. But... (PAUSE) [00:11:00]
THERAPIST: How so?
CLIENT: So... (LAUGHTER) Tanya (ph) has a few friends who are women and priests. They find it difficult to date because most men that they meet... (PAUSE) ...sort of response in one of two ways. [00:14:11]
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: Okay. I feel like I have been saying that I’m curious about you for a long time and not asking questions. [00:15:03]
THERAPIST: No. But it’s more obvious in your asking and the questions that you have.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Sure. (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: And I guess I asked about the pregnancy piece because many of the questions that you’re asking is around pregnancy and my relationship and so forth. So the curiosity seems to revolve around that in particular. [00:16:01]
CLIENT: Yeah, I think it’s generally true that I’m very curious about your relationships. (PAUSE) [00:17:00]
THERAPIST: Where did that come from? [00:20:59]
CLIENT: Me. (LAUGHTER) You know, you’re asking why I’m asking questions. One possibility is that you’re uncomfortable with me asking questions. So...
THERAPIST: No. I want to understand where it’s coming from.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I’m not feeling uncomfortable.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: But I’m feeling that this is extremely important to you and we’re here to understand what’s important to you for sure. And it seems like there’s kind of some anxiety around it too. (PAUSE) [00:22:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. It’s hard. Every time I ask you a question, I tell you something about myself, about what I’m curious about, about the things that matter to me in some way. I tell you how much you matter to me and... (PAUSE) Yeah. I think I am deeply afraid of disappointment or loss. Neither ","P1-N400891":"of those capture the right sentiment. So, yeah, there’s a sense of... I’m also afraid of hurting other people. I don’t like to do that and so there’s sort of... There’s anxiety around that. [00:23:09]
THERAPIST: Well, as a result of being pregnant, I’m going to be away for some period of time.
CLIENT: Yeah. Actually, that... (SIGH) (LAUGHTER) I’m okay with that, I think. So Tanya asked me a couple weeks ago. I told her that I was going to see you more frequently because you were going to be gone for a while or the payment we had worked out because you were going to be gone for a while. ","P1-N4008D1":"She said, “So, are you going to be okay?” (LAUGHTER) Chad (ph) is out of town or on vacation this week. She was apprehensive about that at the time. So she was drawing on her own experience and suggesting that that would be a very hard things for me. I don’t have the sense that that’s ","P1-N4008D2":"true. [00:24:09]
THERAPIST: But it does seem like, in addition to the curiosity, there’s something that you’re sort of struggling or grappling with. (PAUSE)
CLIENT: (SIGH) (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: And I’m very curious... I’m curious about you choosing to sit in a chair that makes you feel uncomfortable. (PAUSE) [00:27:00]
CLIENT: So my initial thought is, you know, I don’t come here because I want to be in pain forever since I come here for exactly the opposite reason. I have the sense that like there are things in my life both that are causing me pain and there are things in the past that have caused a great deal ","P1-N4009F1":"of pain... (PAUSE) But I also get the sense sometimes that there are particular things that I do or find uncomfortable that... (PAUSE) ...I just need to do. [00:29:11]
THERAPIST: Oh, I wouldn’t say, “Let’s figure out what you’re afraid of so we can figure out whether it’s real or not.” That would not be the second half of that sentence for me.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I felt the need to interrupt you there.
CLIENT: I’m glad you did. It’s very interesting that you would say that. You definitely, in association with fears, suggested that they may or may not be real or the thing in which I’m afraid may or may not be real in the context of why am I afraid of intimacy with Tanya. At least ","P1-N400B51":"that’s how I heard it. [00:35:57]
THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess... I don’t... That’s just not how I frame things.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: They’re real because... I mean, what’s a real fear versus not?
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: So I... The goal, in my mind, the goal of exploring the fear is not to find whether it’s real or not.
CLIENT: Yeah. So... (PAUSE) I feel like I’ve mangled what you’ve said now. But I... (PAUSE) But I do feel like you suggested that the... (PAUSE) ...not the fear but the thing of which I am afraid may not be real. (PAUSE) Which seem like different things to me. They may not be different things. [00:37:05]
THERAPIST: I think I’m not following. Let me try to follow along.
CLIENT: Okay. Fear is a feeling. But it’s a feeling about a thing, about an event that may or may not happen. And it might not be possible for that thing to happen. And, in that sense, the thing that one might be afraid might be unreal.
THERAPIST: But all events could possibly happen. I mean, you could be afraid of the end of the world and that’s a possibility too. (LAUGHTER) So... (PAUSE)
CLIENT: So, you know, being who I am, this is a case where I’m actually... I would say, “Well, what do the data say? What does the transcript say that you said that I heard different from what you said?” That’s... Not that we actually need to do that but that’s how I function.
THERAPIST: You heard me very differently, it sounds like.
CLIENT: Clearly I heard you very differently than whatever you meant to be said. Now I’m sort of curious about what you meant to be saying. [00:38:09]
THERAPIST: Well, I was thinking... (PAUSE) This isn’t beside the point but there’s other points besides this. But I was thinking it depends on what you put in the foreground and background. Because even if you’re sure it’ll go away, I would say that you’re similarly sure ","P1-N400D31":"that it’ll come back again because being sure it’ll go away is sort of seeing a cycle which I’m not 100% sure, you know, you’re (inaudible at 00:40:37)
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: I don’t know if this is an upward trend or cycle. But thinking it’s a cycle certainly seems possible. She’ll come back again. But what’s in the foreground is her going away. Which I don’t mean to be quibbling or focusing on her coming back but it’s just ","P1-N400D71":"to give a sort of perspective on that take.
CLIENT: Yeah. I appreciate that and think there’s something interesting in that. I’ve been thinking if you ask me what I think of something, I’m more likely to respond with the things I don’t like about it. My guess is you are more likely to respond with the things you do like ","P1-N400D91":"about it. [00:41:11]
THERAPIST: Why do you feel like you even should?
CLIENT: I don’t know.
THERAPIST: To me? You need to apologize to me?
CLIENT: That’s the feeling.
THERAPIST: What have you done to me to have that view or that you feel that you need to apologize for?
CLIENT: I’m not sure. But I wanted to tell you I had the feeling so we could explore it. I think, in some sense, I’ve rejected the hope that you were extending or the positive vision. So I think I feel bad about that, I think. [00:43:01]
THERAPIST: I have no emotional commitment to that view.
CLIENT: Okay. Thanks. That’s helpful. (PAUSE) So this fear of loss takes a whole lot of forms. In searching for a job, I’m afraid that... I have a very good advisor now. I’m afraid that I will be in a situation where I have a less good advisor, somebody who is not supportive. And so ","P1-N400EF1":"there’s a loss associated with that. I’m afraid that I will get trapped into something I don’t like or enjoy. That’s not a reason not to do it. But that’s just a thing to be aware of and take into account when I’m selecting my work. [00:44:06]
THERAPIST: That’s good. I don’t mean to interrupt. I realize, you’ve... We’ve run a little long.
CLIENT: Oh I’m sorry.
THERAPIST: No, no, no. It’s not your fault. Please.
CLIENT: The clock is...
THERAPIST: Yeah. That clock is slow. I know that clock is slow. Oh, if you ever even notice that clock... I should set it correctly. It’s few minutes slow.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: But I’ll see you tomorrow. And tomorrow we’re meeting at 11:50.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Okay. Great. So I will you then.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay. Take care. [00:46:07]
