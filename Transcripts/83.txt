TITLE: Client "CRT" Therapy Session Audio Recording, January 10, 2013: Client discusses her mother's passive aggressive attitude and how it has a negative impact on their relationship.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her mother's passive aggressive attitude and how it has a negative impact on their relationship.
THERAPIST: Hi, come in. (pause)
CLIENT: It's cold.
THERAPIST: I can turn the heat up.
CLIENT: No, it's okay. I'll take my coat off. (pause) Let's see. This week is going by really slow. (chuckles) I haven't talked to my mom. She hasn't reached out to try and talk to me or anything. She sent me a box of stuff that I had left at her house, and I got it yesterday. (pause)
THERAPIST: What do you want her to hear from you?
CLIENT: (pause) I just I feel like I just want her to understand that I need her support and I don't always you know, she can give me her opinion and that's fine, but this isn't about her and every situation I mean, I think there's so much that I want her to hear and I don't want her to ","P1-N400211":"be attacked because or her attacking me, you know, because I'm coming here.
THERAPIST: You want to reach her but you don't know if she is reachable.
CLIENT: Yeah. Like I feel like I'm at the point where I'm trying to say something to her and I want to have a conversation with her, but you know the second you try to have a conversation with her, she automatically goes on the defensive. You know, she justifies why she does things and she acts a certain ","P1-N4002D1":"way and I notice that, you know, I've been doing the same thing at times.
THERAPIST: So she's someone where things happen to her but actions she takes doesn't lead to things. It's simply that from her perspective.
CLIENT: Yeah. So everyone is attacking her. You know, my one aunt, she's very judgmental right off the bat. You know, she has her own issues and her own way of dealing with things.
THERAPIST: How does it feel to be in that role?
CLIENT: It just it feels like a lot. I don't have kids. I shouldn't have to be you know, I know I'm an adult, but I shouldn't have to play the adult in a parent-child relationship that, you know, I'm technically the child. (pause) You know, it's disheartening and it's exhausting and it's frustrating.
THERAPIST: Well, you don't know what to say to her and you don't know what to do about your feelings about her.
CLIENT: No. I just kind of want to I don't know if I should just, you know, let them go and let go and just realize that this is how she's going to always be and then, you know, be the one that's forced to because she's obviously not going to modify her behavior. So I'm going to have to modify ","P1-N4006F1":"mine in order to, I guess, not really accommodate her but more so accommodate my own life so that I'm not so tortured by the way she is, which I think is a little unfair but, you know, if I have to be the adult in this situation anyway, I might as well just do whatever I can to sort of deal with it. (pause)
THERAPIST: Well, you go back and forth between feeling like maybe there's just something I can say differently in order to get through to her, which is one of the questions you were asking me.
CLIENT: Mmmm-hmmm.
THERAPIST: Maybe I have a different approach or tactic or line of attack -
CLIENT: (chuckles)
THERAPIST: to get through to her. And then at other times you feel like well, this is who she is and I'm going to have to find some way to deal with it. And that going back and forth, I think, is part of what makes you feel confused.
CLIENT: Yeah, because I don't know what the right answer is. I don't know if it's I mean, talking to my best friend, talking to my boyfriend, they're all like "She's your mom. She doesn't seem like she's going to change."
THERAPIST: How do your conversations end up in screaming?
CLIENT: It's usually well, you know, the freshest one would be Sunday when I tried to sort of say to her "I really just need your support right now. This isn't about you. You can't yell at me. It's not fair for you to yell at me because I don't answer your text message in like five minutes, five ","P1-N4008D1":"seconds, five hours of when you you know, I'm fine and that doesn't warrant you to react the way that you do."
THERAPIST: Yeah, that's not going to go anywhere. I can advise you not to do that.
CLIENT: (laughter) And that's what I did, and she just exploded. She was like "What do you mean?" and it was all justification as to why she acted that way and why she thinks that it's warranted because I'm her child. But I'm not eight. Even if I'm eight, she doesn't need to react that way. You know, ","P1-N400911":"she always has.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: Because she -
THERAPIST: I think I've heard of a couple of other faces [right next to that].
CLIENT: (laughter)
THERAPIST: I believe you that her face is [next to it as well].
CLIENT: Like the fact that she's not talking to me right now is very passive-aggressive in her -
THERAPIST: Well, it's very childlike.
CLIENT: in her way of saying things. And when we hung up the phone, she was like "Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine. Whatever." You know, she's not like genuine about it. She's just very passive-aggressive about she's very passive-aggressive about everything and she, you know it's frustrating. Like ","P1-N400A51":"you have to be one or the other, you can't be both because it just does not work out. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well, I'm deeply sympathetic to the way that you want to talk with her and that makes perfect sense. I imagine that you telling her what she's doing wrong or how she could behave differently, like it's not fair that she's doing this, that or the other thing, while I think that's completely ","P1-N400AB1":"accurate, it isn't going to go anywhere with her -
CLIENT: (chuckles)
THERAPIST: from how you describe her.
CLIENT: That's true. I mean, maybe -
THERAPIST: Because she's going to feel criticized.
CLIENT: And she does, and she feels like that's why she goes on the defensive because she feels like I'm attacking her. I'm not attacking her, I'm just trying to convey about how it makes me feel and she just doesn't get it. (pause) I don't even know what to say to her. She's just always going to be ","P1-N400B71":"I feel like she's always going to be on the defensive. I don't know if I need to use more "I" statements about like the way I feel and that would sort of help. (pause) The way she is, she just turns it around to being about her. (pause) Then the conversation just starts like going off into left ","P1-N400B72":"field about something else, then my whole point is lost. (pause) That's why I'm like I don't know how to even begin to say anything to her.
THERAPIST: Well, you feel like and you are in this horrible dilemma of desperately wanting to reach a mother who feels absolutely unreachable.
CLIENT: Mmmm-hmmm.
THERAPIST: And you don't know what to do about it.
CLIENT: Uh uh.
THERAPIST: And you don't know what to do about your feelings about that because it's a very painful feeling.
CLIENT: It is, yeah. (pause) I just don't want to feel so frustrated with her right now when I have so many other things going on. You know, my boyfriend is going to court next week to be possibly arraigned on charges of assault and battery against me for something that didn't happen. I would like to ","P1-N400C51":"focus on that right now, and focus on dealing with that, and talking to the lawyers and doing all that stuff.
THERAPIST: It's very frustrating not to be able to make the people we love the kind of people we'd like them to be and that we need.
CLIENT: Yes. And I know I can't change her, so I guess the only option is to just accept accept the way that she is. I mean, there's things about my best friend that bug me and there's things about -
THERAPIST: I do feel I mean, this is a ways in the future, but having worked with lots and lots of people -
CLIENT: (chuckles)
THERAPIST: and certainly in different ways and some common ways, you know, women with their mothers and troubled relationships for a variety of reasons, that over time that one is able to lower one's expectations which is extremely painful.
CLIENT: So I guess if I just sort of get to the point where my expectations of my mom are not too, you know she can't be the person that I need when I or go to when I have some sort of issue, you know, and not really even expect her to be there which sucks, but do I have any other choices? (pause) ","P1-N400DD1":"She's just not able to do that, and if she's not capable of it, then I can't force her. I can't be, I guess, angry with her, right?
THERAPIST: You could be angry with her -
CLIENT: (chuckles)
THERAPIST: if you want. You don't have to get a special license to be angry at a parent.
CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah, I just I guess I really just need to accept the fact that this is the way that she's going to be and not get myself so upset about it. And, you know, not be so emotional and just realize that, you know, as much as I would like her to be someone that I could go to when something ","P1-N400E71":"is happening, she is just not emotionally capable of that. And I can say that now and try and swallow it, but it's still a hard thing to kind of grasp and accept.
THERAPIST: Of course.
CLIENT: I don't know if I'll ever be able to really just be totally fine with it, but it just has to be something that I sort of accept.
THERAPIST: Well, as we were talking about last time, especially in the sort of context of, you know, an impending important loss in your life, why wouldn't you turn to the people that you want to be connected to?
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: With everything that happened that was happening and then that happened with your boyfriend and fearing losing him, of course you would turn to someone you feel you want to be there for you, whether or not she has those abilities.
CLIENT: Mmmm-hmmm.
THERAPIST: and it's just such a profound disappointment.
CLIENT: Yeah. It's just constant it's almost like it's a cycle of disappointment. Like she goes through times of being fine and she creates drama and I think like oh, she came up here, I needed her. But at some point, it turned into being about her and less about me, and the fact that she came all ","P1-N400FF1":"the way up here and she took off of work I just don't think that there's a possibility of her really genuinely being able to realize that it's not always about her. (pause)
THERAPIST: What does it feel like?
CLIENT: (pause) It's hurtful and it's painful and you you go through your whole life and all she has ever tried to do is say like "You don't have anybody else. I'm the only person that's ever been there for you. I'm the only one that's ever cared about you."
THERAPIST: What day is it?
CLIENT: and all that stuff. It's next Friday. So we'll basically be in court all day. I talked to Kevin's lawyer on Friday.
THERAPIST: Is he older than you?
CLIENT: Mmmm-hmmm.
THERAPIST: [Twenty years or 28]?
CLIENT: He is in his late thirties. So yeah, he's been in for 19 years. He's just sort of, I guess, panicky about his job, which he very well should be.
THERAPIST: I do wonder, does it carry over from your relationship with your mom where she communicates that she resents things that she doesn't feel you appreciate or recognize?
CLIENT: I do feel like sometimes my actions towards him have carried over from the relationship that I have with my mom. I do sometimes portray the same similar actions of, you know, maybe overreacting and whatnot. I'm not passive-aggressive. I will, you know I do get afraid to sort of talk to him ","P1-N4012F1":"sometimes because I'm scared that he's going to react the way that my mom reacts. (pause)
THERAPIST: Yeah, but that's also feeling that somehow whatever you are or aren't carrying and how relationships are destined to fail or destined to end up like you and your mom, whether you're playing the role of you or the role of your mom.
CLIENT: Mmmm-hmmm.
THERAPIST: Almost like they'll be contaminated.
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. And I don't I don't want that. I don't want sort of like no matter what relationship I ever enter into, it's always going to just flop or be problems because of how my relationship is with my mom. You know, I don't want to blame her for things. I don't want to like point fingers ","P1-N4013F1":"at her or anything. But I can't help but think like her being the way that she is and reacting to things has sort of rubbed off on me, and now I sort of act like that.
THERAPIST: It depends on what you want to accomplish.
CLIENT: (pause) I sort of don't even really know right now. I guess I sort of need to figure out what exactly I need to accomplish with her, and what I want to sort of get across to her, and what type of relationship I want to have with her before I can even begin how to talk to her.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: Or figure out a way to best get my point across. (pause) Yeah, I think that would be better.
THERAPIST: It seems like you don't always know what you know. Like it seems like you have a fairly clear idea in your mind about who she is and her limitations, and you describe her very coherently. I've never met her, but it certainly makes sense.
CLIENT: Yeah, I do doubt myself. I doubt that maybe I'm perceiving her in a different way. But I guess either way, I mean, this is how I understand the relationship with her whether I mean, it's from my point of view. So if I feel this way about her and how she acts, I can't be wrong, right? That's ","P1-N4015D1":"just the way I feel. Of course, she would say "Well, no, I'm not acting that way." But other people have seen it. So I should probably be a little more sure of myself. I just am afraid of, you know, misjudging or something.
THERAPIST: Like that difference between her perception and your perception is part of where the doubt comes from, I think.
CLIENT: Mmmm-hmmm, yeah.
THERAPIST: And she's your parent, she's your mom. And so to have to rely on your judgment when it differs from hers is challenging and confusing at times.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't want to like I don't want to go against her and perceive her as a certain way. But you know, I guess I need to be more confident in the way I feel. This is the way I feel, and this is the way I perceive things, so I shouldn't really doubt myself. And I'm not the only one that ","P1-N401671":"has seen her act in certain ways. (pause) You know, I guess this is just how I feel. (pause)
THERAPIST: We really do need to stop for today.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Oh, so Monday the time I'll have is 11:50.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Does that work?
CLIENT: Mmmm-hmmm.
THERAPIST: Great, so that will be your time. 11:50 on Monday and then 1:20 on -
CLIENT: 1:20 on Thursdays.
THERAPIST: Thursdays.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay, great.
CLIENT: That works for me, thank you.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: And then so this Monday I'll see you, and then next Thursday. Are you taking off for Martin Luther King?
THERAPIST: No, I'm here on Martin Luther King Day.
CLIENT: Oh, okay. I'm not sure if I'm going to, you know, maybe go the people I work for he's like in between jobs, so he's going to be off for a week, so I might ask them if I can go visit my best friend in Pennsylvania or something like that.
THERAPIST: Sure, let me know.
CLIENT: So I will let you know.
THERAPIST: Sure, I'm here.
CLIENT: I will know by next week.
THERAPIST: That's fine, I'm here. But you know, people take off, so that's fine.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay, take care.
CLIENT: Thanks.
THERAPIST: Bye.
CLIENT: Bye.
