DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her issues with over-scheduling herself and then getting annoyed when she is stressed. Client discusses her feelings of obligation towards authority figures, especially her therapist.
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in.
CLIENT: Sorry I am late. (pause) So next Monday you are out? Is that it?
THERAPIST: Yeah. Next Monday. We scheduled something. I think I had. (pause) I was actually just thinking that. So I have you down at 10:15 next Thursday. We had talked about that. Maybe I put you down I put you down with a question mark. So I think I had said that I could meet on Thursday morning ","P1-N400111":"instead of Monday morning and I think you had said that would work for you. Does that work for you still, next Thursday?
CLIENT: Yeah, I think I have something on Thursday. So it won’t work. (laughs) Sorry.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Lets talk about the schedule though. It seems like, you know. [00:05:31]
CLIENT: No, yeah, so. (laughs) I signed up to do this thing, like a readers theater with children. I signed up for stuff halfheartedly because I am like, “I don’t know if I want to do it.” You know. (laughs) But I think I should do it because it is two days, it is Thursday and Friday ","P1-N400171":"and, yeah, I think it might be good to kind of see what they do. Something different. So I will check it out.
THERAPIST: Well, I mean they sound like overlapping issues. I was bringing up the issue less about your, sort of how you respond to my asking, more you usually don’t schedule things during session time, so. [00:09:59]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So you have been doing that more. So that is why I am asking.
CLIENT: Oh no. Like Thursday [isn’t for] (ph) session times. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Right. I know. Well, Monday we didn’t Well, last Wednesday you tried to cancel and then you canceled on Monday.
CLIENT: Yeah. Last Wednesday. Yeah, because I had this story due on Tuesday and I didn’t finish. So I thought I would work all day Wednesday. What did I do? I mean, yeah, I finished it on Friday and sent it. I can’t remember last Wednesday at all. Yeah. I have no memory of that. (laughs) ","P1-N400311":"Yeah, probably caught up on stuff. But I came here, right?
THERAPIST: Yeah. I am not trying to say, “Well, why aren’t you showing up?” I am saying it is unlike you to schedule, it is very unlike you. You are almost always here on Monday and Wednesdays. [00:11:05]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It just seems like a change. So that is why I am bringing it up.
CLIENT: No, it was just this past Monday, right?
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: Yeah, last Wednesday because I had the story due and this past Monday because they had a meeting from eleven to twelve. And I couldn’t have got there at eleven, at Amherst (ph) at eleven if I had the session. So (laughs) that is all. I couldn’t tell them, “No, I can’t come.”
THERAPIST: And it is not like you to not reschedule too. You usually like to come twice a week.
CLIENT: Yeah. But I don’t know. I feel, yeah, like next Thursday the thing is at some time in the middle of the day. I don’t think I can come here at 10:15 and get there on time. So (laughs) yeah. I mean it is unusual but hopefully this won’t happen again. Because usually there isn’t ","P1-N400411":"stuff on Monday mornings or Wednesday mornings. Usually I don’t volunteer for anything but I thought this might be interesting. So, yeah. [00:12:15]
CLIENT: I just have to learn to be kind of less passive. And even with my own feelings to acknowledge what they are and acknowledge the problem, and try to figure out the best solution. So, yes, I was late. And, yes, I was even more late because I didn’t figure out that they were meeting.
THERAPIST: What would you like to talk about?
CLIENT: Just my relationship scenario, status. I don’t know. Chris (sp) is like, “This summer. That is it.” And I feel that is true and I cannot keep on doing what I am doing. I have to change the situation. If at least for other people involved if not for my own sanity. He is like, ","P1-N4004D1":"“For your own sanity you should stop.” And I am like, “I am not going insane.”
THERAPIST: So I am sorry. Go ahead.
CLIENT: No. That is okay.
THERAPIST: Well when he says, “So this needs to stop,” or “This needs to change,” what is he referring to specifically?
CLIENT: Well, he wants a clean break up so he can start seeing other women. And, you know, it is completely fair, right? After I stop seeing him and stop going over to his place. (laughs) (sigh) Yeah. I feel like I just cannot let go of him. So I have to figure out what is next. I can’t be as ","P1-N400571":"needy as I am. You know? It is just not fair, healthy and just and fair. [00:15:32]
THERAPIST: Yeah. Why do you say that to him?
CLIENT: I don’t know. I probably believe it. (laughs) I don’t know. Because we have a really good rapport and we are really good companions. And we have fun together and good conversations. So (laughs).
THERAPIST: Well we can talk about your belief in it, but even if you believed it why would you say that to him?
CLIENT: Why not? Oh, to, to (pause) To stop him from breaking up. (laughs)
THERAPIST: I see. (pause) [00:19:10]
CLIENT: I don’t know. I mean, doesn’t it seem I mean, I feel like I should have a friend who should tell me, “This is a perfect guy. He has a “ Or, you know, not a friend. Maybe like an aunt or maybe a friend who is like an aunt saying that, you know, “He is a perfect ","P1-N4006D1":"guy. He has a good job. He is smart. He loves you. He cares about you and you care about him. You could do anything for him and that is love.”
THERAPIST: It would still be, meaning in what ways?
CLIENT: Just me wanting him but at an arm’s length.
THERAPIST: Hm.
CLIENT: (laughs)
THERAPIST: Well it seems like you have thought I mean the people like Nelson (sp), you seek them out. So I agree with that because you seek out other people. [00:21:48]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It is not like they happen upon you.
CLIENT: Yeah. No, I mean I go back to the time when I met him and right before when I was You know, things were kind of very peachy between Chris (sp) and me, almost. You know, like I was living with him. It was peachy. It was peachy financially too. Am I using peachy correctly? (laughs)
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: You know, like he was paying rent at his place and I was paying my Mom’s rent, you know, almost all of it. And it was nice, you know? I didn’t mind doing that. She was away but she came and visited me and, you know, I was trying to be as creative in all these different endeavors ","P1-N400891":"as much as I could.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: My friend was asking, would I seek out other guys if I was with Nelson (sp) completely? And I said, “Yes,” to him but I am not sure I would.
THERAPIST: What would the difference be?
CLIENT: Well at least in the beginning I will try to be all into Nelson (sp) and not seek other people for excitement, for sex or for romance. (pause) Yeah, I don’t understand. Can you really, is this even Is it silly to break up with someone just because they are subdued? (laughs) [00:26:48]
THERAPIST: Is that what you think the problem is with Chris (sp)?
CLIENT: Yeah. Sometimes I think that I am sure that is not the only thing but I think like that. (laughs) That is what comes to mind sometimes. (laughs) (pause) And it is not like Nelson (ph) jumps off the walls all the time. (laughs) But [I am observing] (ph) that even when we are supposedly having ","P1-N400A11":"the most exciting time -
THERAPIST: Well I think it is a lot more complicated than who do you choose.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because it is how you feel. And what does it all mean to you? I think it is much more about that and who is the right person for you.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) What do you mean, “What does it mean to me?” [00:29:27]
THERAPIST: Well, you know, we have talked about what Chris (sp) represents, who he represents to you, what he represents to you.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You know, it is much more beyond is he a good match for you, which is important too.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I feel I have come a long way. Or not a long way, a short way, but I have come (laughs) from feeling that way. Because you used to say, you identified how Chris (sp) represents structure and, you know, this and that. And why can’t I make that on my own? And I feel And I ","P1-N400B51":"have learned how to do that.
THERAPIST: Something else? Like, yeah, how are you thinking about that?
CLIENT: Like I am completely different now than I was two years ago. You know? Like if I fill out a chart in a doctor’s office I would be ticking off alcohol units. You know? Like three to four every week. And it used to be not every week. You know, a couple of years ago. So it is like every weekend ","P1-N400BF1":"and like, okay, you know, time to go out and have drinks with friends. You now? That never used to be the case.
THERAPIST: I see, so what you are saying is that if your needs constantly change, how can you choose a partner if that grows out of what you might need from another person? [00:33:20]
CLIENT: Yeah. And Chris (sp) is pretty set. He was pretty set eight years ago when I met him. Like he was pretty set. I would say he hasn’t changed. Or he has changed a little but there is not much room for growth there. (laughs) He would never He doesn’t want to go out drinking, never ","P1-N400C51":"ever. Wine gives him headaches. He doesn’t do that. You know?
THERAPIST: What Chris (sp) means?
CLIENT: Yeah. Like beyond structure what else does he mean to me? Like an authority figure? I think we have talked about that. Yeah, I feel I am seeking out authority figures less and less. Yeah.
THERAPIST: Well I do want to comment about Chris (sp). I know I keep coming back to this and maybe I am just barking up the wrong tree. But there is a way in which you are experiencing me as an authority figure now that I feel is really important for us to understand. Not because it is so important ","P1-N400CF1":"that we talk about the treatment but I am wondering if it reflects something about what is going on inside of you. That is why I bring it up.
CLIENT: You as an authority figure?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Like there is a way in which And, I mean, this happens with a lot of the obligations you feel. That you seek them out and then you kind of feel trapped by them or kind of annoyed that you are stuck with these obligations. “Why are you making me do this?” [00:35:29]
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: And I feel like there is a little bit of that going on in here. Not entirely but that is why I want to It sort of turns into something that you are seeking out because you want help and you want understanding. And it is sort of like, “Oh, these are sessions that I have to commit to ","P1-N400DB1":"but I have other things to do.”
CLIENT: (laughs)
THERAPIST: Like somehow there is a certain kind of obligation that feels onerous or at least conflicting with other things that are important to you.
CLIENT: It does feel a little bit that way but, I don’t know, I don’t know if I feel about the sessions as much as I feel about say classes or other obligations as you say. I definitely feel like (sigh) I am trapped with them. And I am trying not to think that way. I keep telling myself, ","P1-N400E11":"“No. I signed up for this for this reason. Focus on that.” You know? Like I wanted to do this readers theater to see how kids do this and that is what I am going to get out of it. [00:36:37]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: So, yeah, I guess I have to keep reminding myself of that.
THERAPIST: Okay, but unlike other experiences where you are not going to really be talking about this with a professor. I mean it is okay that you feel trapped.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean it is not okay in the long run because it doesn’t feel good. But we can also try to explore those feelings together.
CLIENT: Yeah. What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Well, you know, if you show up at your professor’s office and you are pissed off that you have to be there I am not really sure there is much productivity. (ph) I mean, okay. But here we can talk about that. It is an opportunity for us to understand those feelings. [00:37:53]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You came here very pissed off -
CLIENT: (laughs)
THERAPIST: that you have to be here and you had other things to do. I am not encouraging you to come here pissed off, per se. (laughs)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like artificially create it. But that is what we are here to do, to understand those feelings not just to try to control them.
CLIENT: Yeah, no, I don’t think I am pissed off. I wasn’t pissed off on Monday.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: I just was kind of pissed off that I was late and I had missed out. And, yeah, like I said, I had my laptop with me so that really kind of gives me the feeling, I guess, “It is right here and I can work.” (laughs) So, yeah, but I was pissed off for a different reason. And I come ","P1-N401051":"here kind of, you know, running and I am a few minutes late but I am not pissed off to be here.
THERAPIST: It is a terrible feeling.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It is a terrible feeling.
CLIENT: But I think I am learning how to not feel that. Although, you know, like with my Mom I feel trapped to help her. And I don’t think I have figured out (laughs) a very good solution. But then I am like, you know, it will take years to resolve, I think, this thing. I mean the feeling. What do you say?
THERAPIST: No. Not necessarily.
CLIENT: Yeah?
THERAPIST: Not at all. I think it is a big difference if you feel like you are giving it versus it is being taken from you.
CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like it is being taken from me.
THERAPIST: I know.
CLIENT: (laughs) (pause)
THERAPIST: And I understand why you feel like that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But it is a very big difference. Not everybody who visits their parents every day feels that way.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: They feel it is a choice that they are making. It is very different than feeling like, “I have to do this. This is something that is expected.”
CLIENT: Yeah. Well I have thought that just not doing it will help. (laughs) And then instead of feeling guilty to do it I feel I want to do it. Maybe you disagree with that but I feel like that works or it is working.
THERAPIST: Well I am certainly I am an empiricist at heart. So if it is working it is working.
CLIENT: (laughs)
THERAPIST: I am not going to I don’t dis If it is working it is working. So.
CLIENT: Yeah. So, I mean, I ignore my Mom a lot. Like I don’t go see her -
THERAPIST: Do you want me to turn on the heat by the way? [00:41:30]
CLIENT: Oh, no, that is okay.
THERAPIST: It is so cold today.
CLIENT: Strange. There is snow on the ground.
THERAPIST: It was like 31 degrees this morning.
CLIENT: But, yeah, and then after several days of not seeing her I wonder about her and I want to see her. So I am trying to learn to be different. But I am taking other people’s help. Like I am taking Nelson’s (sp) help because he is all about, “I am selfish and I only do stuff for ","P1-N4013F1":"people if it is convenient for me, if it makes me feel good.”
THERAPIST: But you come by this feeling honestly. You know? Because your mother can I mean, for so many different reasons, you know, one of which is your mother very much communicated to you what she sacrificed for you and what you owe her.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Implicitly and explicitly. It is not something that you are fabricating.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I am trying to separate that from everything and ball it up and put it like, okay, that was a narrative. Not something like the narrative that is around. Or even the narrative that she has. She has some narratives too.
THERAPIST: True.
CLIENT: So take that and take it and understand it and rationalize it but not let it govern me so much. Because I think it kind of did for a few years back there. But, yeah, I guess and to rise above it and separate myself. [00:44:05]
THERAPIST: I know you are working very hard.
CLIENT: (laughs)
THERAPIST: I see that.
CLIENT: But not hard enough in this relationship scenario. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Why do you say that?
CLIENT: Well, I feel like that is true. Like I work hard in certain areas and not at all in others. So I am slacking in that.
THERAPIST: Well, leaving that question aside, whether you are slacking or not. I am not chiming in on that. I don’t really know how to think about that yet. But it is a much more complicated situation.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, and there are so many people involved now and they are all like, “Hello! You can’t just do this.” (laughs)
THERAPIST: It is complicated. Right. It involves other people and it is confusing.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know. I feel like I just want to just talk to Nelson (sp) this weekend and tell him I cannot continue like this. (laughs) I mean he hasn’t met my Mom and he hasn’t told his parents about me. [00:45:16]
THERAPIST: Cecelia (sp) we do need to stop for today.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So I will see you then next Wednesday.
CLIENT: Enjoy the marathon.
THERAPIST: I’m sorry.
CLIENT: Enjoy the marathon.
THERAPIST: Oh, thank you, thank you. Take care.
CLIENT: You too.
