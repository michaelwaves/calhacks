THERAPIST: Hi! Come on in!
CLIENT: Good morning!
THERAPIST: I’m going to just grab some water.
CLIENT: Okay, sounds good. (pause) How are you?
THERAPIST: Good, thank you!
CLIENT: Are you feeling well? (therapist affirms) When are you due, in June?
THERAPIST: (affirms) The end of the third week, so I’ll be here through the end of the third week.
CLIENT: Okay, great! And then, out July, right?
THERAPIST: Yeah. And I plan to... Yeah, I plan to probably come back either, probably the first week in August. (client affirms) Last week in July, but probably the first week in August, but I’ll definitely be in touch, say, mid-July (client affirms), just to give you a sense of like...
CLIENT: What’s going on.
THERAPIST: ...yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah, oh good! I don’t even remember the last time I was here! Was it like, two weeks ago? (chuckles) [00:01:01]
THERAPIST: No, it was more than that, because I think we were supposed to meet last week originally, and you had rescheduled because...
CLIENT: Oh, right, because I was out of town.
THERAPIST: Like, probably three weeks.
CLIENT: Yeah. So, yeah. I guess I have a really good lawyer. Did I have a lawyer when I came here last time?
THERAPIST: You had just gotten a lawyer.
CLIENT: Okay, so... So that’s good. My trip home went really well. I was very anxious about it. Well, there were a few things. Right before I left, I had asked Rich if he could start giving me some money every month like, some form of child support. We couldn’t agree on an amount. Literally, ","P1-N4002D1":"the amount varies by like a $100, so... which now my lawyer is like, “I don’t even think that’s the right amount.” She’s like, “He should be giving you more.” So, when I landed... So I was already anxious about going home, because, well, A) I was travelling ","P1-N4002D2":"with Brady for the first time by myself. That’s kind of like, you know... I do, I fly with him a lot, but usually Rich was always with me or someone was with me. So this was just like, you know, it’s a lot of logistics, getting him down there, but he was wonderful. You know, obviously, to ","P1-N4002D3":"see my parents and, you know, all this family and stuff, but... [00:02:18]
THERAPIST: Kind of exposed.
CLIENT: Yeah, totally! Like, every one of them has their thing that no one knows about, but like everyone knows everything about me, so... It felt a little weird, but I mean, I just kind of smiled and enjoyed my time with Brady. I was joking and talking to Rich about stuff, like we were fine.
THERAPIST: Well, you’re always seeking out other people’s company.
CLIENT: Right. Right! And it’s like, and if I’m alone, it’s like I notice families together or couples. Like, I notice people with other people, and it’s kind of, I was like, oh, you know like, “I wish I had that.” I kind of, I mean, I do. I have some friends, but... ","P1-N400711":"(pause) It’s just been like, a weird time. Then my friend, Olivia (who’s been great), I haven’t seen her in like, two months. Her husband doesn’t talk to me because of this, all this stuff. But she has kind of been. She’s the one that I was like, unsure about, and then ","P1-N400712":"she’s been great. But, I tried to like, make plans with her and just be like, “Oh, are you available for lunch or, you know...” She just kind of evades my invitations, so... I kind of, I don’t know. I’ve tried often enough that now, I’m just going to stop trying and ","P1-N400713":"I’ll see what she does, but... [00:23:00]
THERAPIST: So you’re waiting for that, and you’re just waiting for him to start paying.
CLIENT: I need him to send me a check. I mean, it’s helpful that he’s paying for daycare, but... you know. At this point, I’m like, it makes me write down every day how much I spend, so I know where I’m at with things. (pause) Yeah, he needs to write me a check or something. ","P1-N4007D1":"(chuckles) I mean, my lawyer was saying that the calculations that were made had daycare included. She was like, “It really shouldn’t even be included, because daycare is only going to be another 14 months, you know.” So she was like, “If you take daycare out of the equation, ","P1-N4007D2":"he actually owes you $1250 versus $900 a month, you know? That makes more sense, for the next 15 years of, or for however longer Brady’s life” She’s like, “And I’ll tell you a judge would agree with that, so...”
THERAPIST: 19 years.
CLIENT: 19, because he’s 20 , yeah, it’s 23.
THERAPIST: Yeah, when it’s 23, it’s (inaudible). [00:28:00]
CLIENT: Yeah, I forget (inaudible) 23. So she was saying, you know, “That amount shouldn’t even be in the...” I didn’t even think about that. I was like, “Oh, that makes sense!” Because she was like, you know, “If you’d gotten divorced next year, then ","P1-N400851":"the calculation would be vastly different,” you know. So, and she was like, “We know that’s going to end at a certain point, in September of 2015.”
THERAPIST: It does seem a little crazy. He’s going to eventually have to pay it, so...
CLIENT: Well, and I said that to him. I was like, “You know, you’re going to have to pay this retroactively.” He was like, “No, I don’t. I’m not going to do that.” And I’m like, “Yes, you do!” And he’s like, “Well, how do, who says?” ","P1-N4008D1":"And I’m like, “Well, my friends who are getting divorced said (chuckles), you know, they’re...” I said, “I have friends in, I have a friend in divorce who, her hus , her ex has to pay her retroactively and is giving her money every month and they’re still and they ","P1-N4008D2":"still haven’t like, signed their document, you know. Like, you know, by law, you’re supposed to give me something, and you’re not giving it to me.” You know, my friend was like, “You should call him a dead-beat dad!” Like, I don’t want to start throwing like, ","P1-N4008D3":"terms around like that, but... She was like, “Essentially, that’s what he’s doing, you know. He’s just like, denying you the money he’s supposed to be giving you.” [00:30:18]
THERAPIST: There was comfort.
CLIENT: Oh, my God, yeah. I mean, they were like cooking for me... or just like... you know, just like being able to be like, “I’m going to go to my Mom’s house today.” Like, and hang out with my Mom or my Dad. It’s like, I can’t do that. So... I mean, it makes me ","P1-N400931":"want to like, go back and visit them. But then it’s like, I don’t have money to go back. It’s just like... [00:31:18]
THERAPIST: Because of the convenience factor? What’s the frozen dinner?
CLIENT: (laughs) I know exactly how much it’s going to cost and it is a convenient thing, although I’m trying to cook a little bit more. I’m just trying not to like, go out to eat, basically. Not that I was drinking a lot, but my friend and I (who are training for this race), we decided ","P1-N4009B1":"not to drink this month, like for the month, just because we were spending money on like... You know, I just, I was like, “I need to, I can’t spend money. I’m like, really broke.” So she was like, “Let’s just not drink any drinks, any alcohol at all, so...” ","P1-N4009B2":"You know, because that adds up, if you go out for like, two drinks or something. [00:33:16]
THERAPIST: It seems like, when I think about it, it’s like leaving college all over again or something.
CLIENT: It is! Do you follow “[]”? It’s this website where this photographer goes around and just like, sees people on the street, takes their picture, and asks them a couple of questions. It ranges, it’s very cool, it’s a very cool site, but... One of the ones this weekend ","P1-N400A31":"was, (chuckles) it was this woman, who’s sitting on a stoop and she’s like, she’s like, “It really sucks to have to ask your parents for money at 45.” I was like, “That’s so true!” (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I mean, I can see it’s very much on your mind.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I’m just trying to figure out ways to... to cut cor , you know, to save money. (pause) But, we’ll see. Maybe he’ll write me a check soon, maybe next month. I keep thinking that. Maybe next month! I was like, maybe May. Now I’m like, maybe June (chuckles) ","P1-N400AB1":"he’ll write me a check. [00:36:41]
THERAPIST: Would you ever want to get a different job that might pay more?
CLIENT: That’s what he said to me. He was like, I said, “I don’t make that much!” And he was like, “It’s your choice to stay working there.” I considered getting a second job, when I don’t have Brady. I love my job. I feel like it’s rare for people ","P1-N400AF1":"to say they really like their job. I love my job! I would never want to leave it, no. And I know I don’t make that much. I have a review coming up. Hopefully, they’ll give me something. But... I don’t want to go somewhere and hate my job, to make more money. I just, it’s the ","P1-N400AF2":"one, it’s like, the one thing that like, I’m so happy with, besides Brady.
THERAPIST: Am I sounding like Rich? [00:37:32]
CLIENT: No! (chuckles) No, I mean, it’s a good question. I mean, especially if I didn’t like my job, I would be like, “Oh, my God! Let me go somewhere else, but...” But I’ve considered like, “Oh, well maybe, when I don’t have Brady, I can work at a retail store,” ","P1-N400B31":"although I’ve never worked in retail, but... I could work in some store or... I don’t want to work in restaurants again. It’s only work. I could do that, but then it’s like, it would have to be like, every other week, when I have... It can’t be during the day. It would ","P1-N400B32":"have to be at night like, during the week or on weekends. But I could probably find something, I think.
THERAPIST: I think I was asking that, in part, to sort of see if you felt empowered to be able to make money, if you wanted to and make more money if you wanted to.
CLIENT: Um... (sighs) Like...
THERAPIST: It sounds like you have other... you have other priorities.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I’ve worked there, because... Like, we always say the people that work there, work there because we don’t care about money. Like, we all want to make money, but we work in marketing because we like what we do, you know. Yeah, I could totally find a job. You know, I ","P1-N400BD1":"could find a job that paid me more. (pause) But I’ve just gotten to a point in this job, where I’m really... like... I run the marketing on a show, like on a documentary series, a really well-known, [] show, and it’s like, that’s huge! And I love my job! I love my co-workers. [00:39:47]
THERAPIST: That’s great! [00:40:38]
CLIENT: Yeah! I feel very lucky. I know I’m one of the lucky few that can say that, because I know a lot of friends that don’t like their jobs at all. So... It’s hard to walk away from, even though they don’t really pay a lot (chuckles).
THERAPIST: Well, I wanted to make sure that you weren’t coming at it from a place of helplessness, like I said. Like, it sounds like it’s not. It’s something that’s, you like it and it’s something that’s important to you.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, do I, I mean, I think if I put my resume out there, I could get hired pretty... pretty easily. I mean, I say that, being really cocky about it, but, I think I could get hired and get a bigger salary, for sure, or a little bit more than I make now. (pause) I just don’t want to leave.
THERAPIST: It’s accruing over these months.
CLIENT: I know! (chuckles) I know. Yeah. I’m just thankful that he’s paying for the daycare. Like, that’s huge. If I had to pay for that, I’d be screwed. I’d be really screwed. (pause) So... We’ll have dinner tonight.
THERAPIST: You’ll be able to broach it there?
CLIENT: I don’t know. I mean, Brady is sitting with us, so I don’t know like, how appropriate it is to be like...
THERAPIST: It’s with Brady?
CLIENT: Yeah, so like... we usually just kind of talk about what’s going on like, oh... You know, our lives in general and stuff with Brady, so... We don’t really discuss... I think we did it once, when he came over to get him. I think Brady could tell that we were... Because I was kind ","P1-N400D51":"of getting upset, and then Brady kept kind of interrupting and like, try to say funny stuff. So...
THERAPIST: Lighten the mood.
CLIENT: Yeah. So then, I just was like, “Let’s stop talking about this.” He was like, “Yeah, you’re right.” Because we don’t really fight in front of him, you know. [00:43:27]
THERAPIST: He knows what’s going on. (client affirms) He can sense when there is tension.
CLIENT: Yeah, he can sense that I’m getting upset, you know. Or sad. So, it’s good to have, I mean, I mean before I was like, “I don’t want to do these dinners. They’re awkward.” But last night, he was like, “Oh, so tomorrow’s Wednesday.” I was like, ","P1-N400DD1":"“Yeah.” And he was like, “Are we going to do dinner?” And I was like, “Oh!” Because we haven’t done one in like, because I’ve been gone or, you know, travelling or whatever. I was like, “Uh... Sure, I guess!” (chuckles) And he was like, “Okay. ","P1-N400DD2":"We can go to Panera.” I was like, “All right.” So... It’s good for Brady to see us together in a nice way.
THERAPIST: Well, (both chuckle) good luck with that!
CLIENT: Thanks!
THERAPIST: So, I have you down for next week, and then I have you down for two weeks from that. (client affirms) Does that...?
CLIENT: Yeah, that’s easier, because it’s harder for me like, the weeks I have Brady, it’s har , I have my work schedule is shortened.
THERAPIST: I see. And that’s this week. [00:44:24]
CLIENT: That’s why it’s hard for me to like, leave also in the middle of the day.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: So if we sneak it to the...
THERAPIST: Yeah, so for, we’ll start... Yeah, I mean, in general, you know, I understand that things come up in general or whatever, (inaudible) good time for you. Like I, you know, the best you can do to get here (client affirms) if you can, you can, obviously, but definitely, okay.
CLIENT: I have an, I’ll, can I leave you a check? I was going to give $100 and then (therapist affirms) could you, can you hold it until Friday? Because I get paid on Friday? (therapist agrees)
THERAPIST: (pause0) I’ll put it aside.
CLIENT: Do you have a pen?
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: Thanks.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: It finally feels summery outside. [00:45:16]
THERAPIST: Is it nice out there?
CLIENT: Yeah, it’s really nice.
THERAPIST: Awesome!
CLIENT: Today is the... 5th?
THERAPIST: Today is the 8th. I think Sunday was Cinco de Mayo.
CLIENT: Oh, right. Okay. (tearing check) Thank you! Thanks for your patience with that. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I appreciate your making small payments. I know that when you actually start getting money from Rich...
CLIENT: I can make it up, just like square away.
THERAPIST: All right, that’s fine. All right, take care. I’ll see you next week. Okay, bye bye.
