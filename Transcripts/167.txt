DESCRIPTION: Client discusses how having dinner with a friend made her feel unsuccessful and depressed about her future in her current field.
THERAPIST: Hi.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:04:08)
THERAPIST: You don't want to talk today?
CLIENT: [laughs] I'm just...I don't know where to start. [laughs] I think of something, and then think of something else, and then think of something else, so, yeah. (inaudible at 00:10:21) [laughs] (inaudible at 00:10:23)
CLIENT: [sighs]
CLIENT: [laughs] I'm just thinking about stuff from this weekend (ph). [I met] (ph) I guess a friend for dinner. She came to MSU couple years after me. She's also from Nepal and...so (ph) I felt we're very different and all, so I just felt like I'm meeting-we meet once a year or something, I don't know. ","P1-N4003F1":"[00:12:02] I've only known her for a little while.
THERAPIST: What do you mean?
CLIENT: Just...the way she asks. Then I was telling Alissa (ph) it's okay if I publish with a small press, at least that will just give me a chance to teach, give me a steady job. That's something I said, but then I say it to-I've said this to many people, and mostly their response is, "No, no. [00:13:06] ","P1-N400451":"You can publish with a big publisher and you'll be successful."
CLIENT: How am I going to learn this lesson that if people are not paying attention to me, that does not mean that they don't like me or they don't want to spend time with me? [laughs] [00:17:04] That they just have other things on their mind and that's okay. [laughs] I could have other things on my mind, too.
THERAPIST: Yeah, that's sometimes true.
CLIENT: Yeah, [I'm trying it out] (ph) only sometimes. [laughs]
THERAPIST: Well, yeah, sure. Whatever (inaudible at 00:18:22) you give attention to will give you attention in return.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What did you want from this woman?
CLIENT: I don't know. [laughs] I guess I wanted this amazing conversation about literature, about how we're struggling, about her be like, "Oh, you know, these rejections I'm getting, they put me down." [00:19:03] Or, "Oh, we love this thing so much, it's so great." Something like that, I guess. I don't ","P1-N4006B1":"know. I guess I do have this...ideal, all these ideals in my head, and then when-and reality is never, ever [laughs] like your ideals. Then I end up getting disappointed.
CLIENT: I mean, she's just more stable, so she's married. She eats healthy food and cooks for her husband. [laughs] They have a bit of money, they have a house.
CLIENT: [sighs] That was just (ph) one thing. Another was I don't know, was it Sunday morning? Yeah, yesterday just looking on Facebook and another friend, her work is coming out and so she was posting about that and an event of her talking about her work. [00:22:00]
THERAPIST: Still?
CLIENT: Eh?
THERAPIST: Still?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You (inaudible at 00:24:11) leave it there?
CLIENT: Yeah, because when I found this room, I just took the basics, like my desk, some books, and moved myself. [laughs] Yeah, most of my books are still at his place.
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, it's funny how I pushed Chris away, for whatever reason because I was unhappy. [00:25:03] Not only that, but...and now I'm wondering if he's actually a source of strength.
CLIENT: Is it bad to go back and forth between two guys? [laughs] I mean, I don't know if that's the way I should look at it, but it feels like kind of become my support system, but then I'm like, "Is that bad? Should I be scared about that?" [laughs]
THERAPIST: What about it is scary?
CLIENT: Well, because, shouldn't that come from within? I mean, I guess not everything can come from within; you'd (ph) still need people. [00:31:00]
THERAPIST: That seems like the question that you grapple with a lot, how much should you rely on other people and when should you try to use yourself as a pillar?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And your interactions with others can definitely throw you off-kilter.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Don't you think?
CLIENT: Yeah. You mean, like with that dinner with the friend. Yeah.
CLIENT: Should I just avoid them? [laughs]
THERAPIST: It depends. If you get something (ph) enough out of them, then there's enough value in that you can weather the parts of them you don't like. [00:32:04] Maybe not, and maybe you feel like it's too disruptive then, maybe.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It's (inaudible at 00:32:15) to think about.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean, I think both you take things very personally when people are just distracted or whatever, and then this woman might be competitive and so forth, be relating to through her own insecurities.
CLIENT: Yeah. [laughs]
THERAPIST: But you look in a very comparative way; very, very comparative.
CLIENT: Yeah. [laughs]
THERAPIST: It's like everything is graded on a curve.
CLIENT: But that means that it's similar-yeah, it is. Everyone gets Brownie points. That's not what you mean.
THERAPIST: I (inaudible at 00:33:32).
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't understand what you mean, [graded that curve] (ph).
THERAPIST: On a curve, it's like when you have a class and 90% is A, regardless. That's not a curve. A curve is your A will be somebody else's B. A curve is relative. A curve is like if there are ten people in the class and everyone gets above 90%, there's still going to be equal distribution. [00:34:01] ","P1-N400DD1":"There are going to be Cs and As and Ds and so forth, because everyone is graded relative to each other...
CLIENT: Ah.
THERAPIST: ...not based on just their own achievement. Not everybody can get all As if you're graded on a curve.
CLIENT: Ah.
THERAPIST: You have to have an equal distribution in the class.
CLIENT: I see. That's what that means.
THERAPIST: Yeah, on a curve.
CLIENT: [laughs]
THERAPIST: I know, it's an expression. It actually means that it doesn't matter if people get 97% to 100%, that 97%-I don't know if it actually means that people fail, might be. But that 97% could be a D, because relative to everybody else, you didn't do well, even if you did really well.
CLIENT: Oh, I see. That's what that means, okay. I never (crosstalk at 00:34:46).
THERAPIST: One person's up is another person's down, yes.
CLIENT: I see. How does that apply to my life or my thinking?
THERAPIST: Well, because it's like someone else's success is ultimately your failure. It's like there's not...
CLIENT: Yeah!
THERAPIST: ...oh, wait, you'll get a book deal from somebody else. There aren't two great books that can both get published. [00:35:03] It's like there's one (inaudible at 00:35:04) book that's going to get published and this just knocks you down. Everything is relative and everything is evaluative (ph) and comparative.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it definitely felt like that, the India girl's success is like my failure. [laughs]
THERAPIST: Absolutely. You describe that really frequently. "Look at what this person did and that person did," and it's automatically a reflection on you on what you haven't done or maybe even what you can't do.
CLIENT: I'm so tired of thinking [laughs] that way, it's so damaging.
THERAPIST: That's great! Doing something differently just because you're exhausted by doing what you're doing, that's fine motivation.
CLIENT: [laughs] (crosstalk at 00:35:49)
THERAPIST: "I'm sick of smoking all the time!" Great! Stop smoking.
CLIENT: [laughs] Well, it's easier said than done, right?
THERAPIST: No doubt.
CLIENT: [laughs] Habits, old habits. [00:36:01]
THERAPIST: But, you know, wanting to stop smoking because you want to be healthy is great. Wanting to stop smoking because you're sick of going to the corner store? Fine!
CLIENT: [laughs] Yeah, I see.
THERAPIST: Cigarettes are expensive. (inaudible at 00:36:16), bought a few packs of cigarettes. I had no idea how much cigarettes were. It was $30 some odd for three packs of cigarettes.
CLIENT: Thirty?
THERAPIST: Some-odd-dollars for three packs.
CLIENT: That's a lot. You can-
THERAPIST: $33? I was just like, "Oh my God."
CLIENT: That's a nice dinner! [laughs]
THERAPIST: That's insane, that's an insane amount of-people spend a lot of money smoking.
CLIENT: [laughs] Yeah. It's cheaper to smoke hookah, much cheaper.
THERAPIST: I'm sure it's cheaper to smoke a lot of things.
CLIENT: [laughs]
THERAPIST: It's probably cheaper to smoke coke! [laughs]
CLIENT: I'm...
THERAPIST: [laughs] Probably not...
CLIENT: [laughs]
THERAPIST: ...but probably cheaper to smoke a lot of things than smoke cigarettes.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: At least it's not taxed.
CLIENT: Yeah, that's where the money goes. Yeah, I don't really smoke. [laughs] [00:37:01]
THERAPIST: I'm sorry, what were you going to say?
CLIENT: I was going to say just another example. I thought about this "Forbes" magazine (inaudible at 00:37:46) and they're just listing 30 Under 30, all these 30 fabulous people who are 22 or whatever. They're like amazing-better than rocket scientists. [00:38:00] What were you going to say?
THERAPIST: It reminds me a little bit of our conversation a long ago not that long ago about being something by association, being chosen...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...by association. It's not quite the same thing, but when you hear someone who does something great, you don't think, "Oh, that could be me!"
CLIENT: [laughs] Hmm.
THERAPIST: Like, "Oh, that's inspiration! She could do it, I can do it!" It's, "Ugh, what haven't I done? What can't I do?"
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It doesn't give you hope. Like, "Oh, look, that's possible!" I mean, you could say if you're surrounded by people who have no success, you could feel like, "Oh, God, I guess no one's doing well. How is that even possible, to do well?" Whereas when you're around people who do well, it's like, ","P1-N401471":""Oh, look, this is possible. This is possible for me, too."
CLIENT: Yeah. But I mean, there is a certain way that media and everything does project these success stories as in, "Na na na na na na," in your face. [00:39:05]
THERAPIST: Or (ph) la-la-la.
CLIENT: [laughs] I feel that way.
THERAPIST: I know you feel that way. Because you feel someone else's success is almost an implicit sort of condescension or implicitly saying, "Look what I did that you didn't do."
CLIENT: I know, and this is at the core of me and it makes me-it creates a lot of problems, a lot of problems.
THERAPIST: I know.
CLIENT: [laughs] It's not just looking at people in the magazine, it's actual people in the room that I could actually get along with and stuff. But as soon as they say, "Oh, I'm a post-doc, I have a Ph. D.," and I just completely freak out. [laughs] Feel horrible and lonely; I just want to run away. [00:40:00]
THERAPIST: I was thinking about him and just his bitterness, too. He's so bitter.
CLIENT: Yeah, very bitter. And he was someone who had early success in life; he went into the best college. He was decent-looking and he was a boxer, so in every area he was-and he got a job right away. [00:41:01] But (inaudible at 00:41:03), for whatever reason... [laughs]
THERAPIST: Which I guess shows you that it's far more a reflection of something that was inside him than anything that was really a reflection of his achievement.
CLIENT: Yeah.
CLIENT: I don't know. Nelson says money brings him confidence. [laughs] He says the moment he walks into a room, he just thinks that everyone likes him, even if they don't. He just tells himself that. [laughs] [00:42:00]
CLIENT: He tells me I should be very cocky because-it matters where you come from and what you struggle with, instead of you're only born with...I don't know.
THERAPIST: You have.
CLIENT: I don't know, I guess I should keep thinking like that. [laughs]
THERAPIST: How you feel is a much lesser function of your success than your feelings about your success.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:44:23)
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: [Have a good night] (ph). I think I mentioned this to you, but if I haven't, the first week of February, I'm away.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: It's not for a few weeks, but just to let you know.
CLIENT: Just one week?
THERAPIST: Yeah, just for that week, exactly.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: It's the week of-I don't know, I think it's the 4th, something like that. Or it's the 3rd, something like that.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: First full week.
CLIENT: All right, no problem.
THERAPIST: Okay. Great. I will see you on Wednesday.
CLIENT: Okay, see you.
THERAPIST: Okay, great. Bye-bye.
CLIENT: Bye, have a good day.
THERAPIST: Thank you.
