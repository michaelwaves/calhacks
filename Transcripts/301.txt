TITLE: Client "S" Therapy Session Audio Recording, March 18, 2013: Client doesn't interact with others in a way that is conducive to 'getting to know her'. She wants to be accepted, but she is very closed-off and unresponsive in most social situations. It is hard for her to emotionally connect to others, even with her boyfriend.
DESCRIPTION: Client doesn't interact with others in a way that is conducive to 'getting to know her'. She wants to be accepted, but she is very closed-off and unresponsive in most social situations. It is hard for her to emotionally connect to others, even with her boyfriend.
THERAPIST: Come on in.
CLIENT: How are you?
THERAPIST: Good, thank you.
CLIENT: You don't take spring break?
THERAPIST: Spring break from?
CLIENT: Oh, you know, it's spring break this week. Everything looks dead. (LAUGHTER) It doesn't?
THERAPIST: From college?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Am I in college?
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) No I'm just saying good. Not that it feels like spring out today. [00:03:03]
THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:04:00]
CLIENT: I kind of had a, I guess slightly, somewhat interesting experience yesterday. I had to go with David (ph) to his chair's for dinner, the department head. And I was dreading it the whole time like, "I don't want to do it! I don't want to do it!" Because usually... I mean, I always try but... ","P1-N4002F1":"I think I've spoken about this before when I've been to his professor's or friend's places I've always felt awkward. [00:05:05]
THERAPIST: I'm not sure I understand. "Your thinking has become the rule for me." I don't know what that means.
CLIENT: Oh like, you know, like I was telling him that I always think, you know, "What would you think in this scenario?"
THERAPIST: I see. You said that to him?
CLIENT: Yeah. So he was like, "That's bad." (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: How did, how did he respond to your saying, you know, you don't inspire passion in me?
CLIENT: Nothing. (LAUGHTER) I think later on he said, like, "You disappoint me too." And I was like, "Ooh." (LAUGHTER) But at first he was like, "Yeah, I know it's a general disappointment and dissatisfaction when the other person is (inaudible at 00:12:51) And then he was like, "You never say â€˜hi' ","P1-N4004B1":"to my parents when they come on Skype." (LAUGHTER) So I was like, "Well, blah, blah, blah..." (LAUGHTER) [00:13:01]
THERAPIST: Mmm.
CLIENT: So...
THERAPIST: I just... I mean, it seemed like you had a very important conversation with him last night telling him you're actually not interested in marriage.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it seems like a big thing to kind of, "Okay. Well next topic."
CLIENT: Yeah. It's like that. (LAUGHTER) That's how it is. I mean, that's what I mean about not connecting emotionally. (LAUGHTER) It seems no emotion can be significant enough to make any difference, you know? [00:16:00]
THERAPIST: Do you feel you're with him because you're afraid to be alone?
CLIENT: Oh yeah. There's several reasons. I mean, I'm using him (inaudible at 00:16:11) to pay my mom's rent. The other concern is what do I do if I want to go to India? And I'm realizing like I could possibly find a cheaper place and move there. I mean, I'm sure there are other spaces like (inaudible) ","P1-N400611":"probably... I don't like to share a place with a lot of people but... I don't know. I've just gotten very comfortable to use that excuse. He has a nice place and... (PAUSE) (LAUGHTER) And we like each other. We have affection. [00:17:05]
THERAPIST: I don't understand.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: He said that he had a priority to get married so I'm not sure what you're referring to. [00:18:01]
CLIENT: Oh no. I mean, like him brushing... Because you said that we had a big conversation and what happened as a result, right?
THERAPIST: Yeah, well both in terms of impact on the two of you and just how you felt about it too.
CLIENT: Yeah. So that's what I'm saying. Like he doesn't do anything, if, you know, that conversation is over and done. Let's move on with our day." That sort of thing. So maybe I should do that too is what I'm saying. Like, again, like his priorities become my priorities of not worrying too much about ","P1-N400711":"how we feel and, you know. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: But it seems like he's making it clear that this is not what he wants, this, you know, this sort of going on kind of relationship.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well he says he's not that keen on marriage. It's just for his parents' sake. [00:19:03]
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: I don't know. I'm so confused because of this. (LAUGHTER) I feel I don't have the guts to change my life situation and as a result, I'm accepting someone else's priorities as my own. [00:20:03]
THERAPIST: I see. Because so many other people's jobs are so easy and they work so few hours.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: I don't know what that means. "People in academia..."
CLIENT: I mean, they're busy right? They're very busy.
THERAPIST: (SIGH) As opposed to attorneys who don't do any work?
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: People in business or finance, physicians? I don't know. It does seem like a very elitist comment.
CLIENT: Yeah?
THERAPIST: I mean, you could easily make the argument, "Academics have so much more free time, so much more flexible time than any other job." (LAUGHTER) [00:22:01]
CLIENT: That's true. That is true. (PAUSE) So how are they emotional? (PAUSE) I'm at a loss of (inaudible at 00:22:49)
THERAPIST: There does seem a sort of, not even sort of, an idealization of academia. You know, of academics as beneath the fray. Other plebeians have time for emotions but not academics. [00:23:03]
CLIENT: No. I'm not trying to... I mean, I'm sure I'm snobby. But here I'm not trying to defend them or like, you know, eulogize them or glorify them. I'm just saying that... And I'm kind of reasoning with myself like saying like, "Why are you making such a big deal of emotions? You know? Like most ","P1-N4009B1":"people don't have time for emotions and, you know, maybe you really are a drama queen, you know?" (LAUGHTER) So... But then, you know, it's that thing that some professions are, maybe I'm wrong... Yeah, you're right. My assumption is wrong. I don't know. [00:23:53]
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: But David has to be part of a whole bunch of initiative and things to get meaning out of like and I'm trying to do that right now. And I'm not saying it's bad. It's probably good for me. But it doesn't mean that I get to... You know, it's not all that I am, you know? Then I'm like, "I don't ","P1-N400A31":"know what I want!" (LAUGHTER) I'm trying so hard to change myself. So I may know what I want. It's just that I'm trying to change and so in the process I'm getting confused (inaudible at 00:25:33) maybe purposefully. So...
THERAPIST: Hmm. Purposefully losing sight.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What do you think the on purpose part is about?
CLIENT: To be with David, to make it work because he keeps saying he loves me and I'm like, I don't know if anyone else could love me. You know? So... [00:26:03]
THERAPIST: Why not?
CLIENT: I don't know. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) He's very nice. I'm sure there are other nice people but it doesn't seem possible.
THERAPIST: What about it doesn't seem possible?
CLIENT: Well someone could be as nice as him and as sensitive and as straight, you know, and as (PAUSE) honest and righteous.
THERAPIST: Is your heart into what you're saying?
CLIENT: My heart?
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. Right now.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Really?
CLIENT: What do you mean heart?
THERAPIST: You seem distracted and you're playing with... Like...
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: If you were trying to sell something right now I wouldn't believe the product.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Yeah. Sorry.
THERAPIST: No need to apologize. I was just pointing out.
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Perhaps all this confusion is because of, or not, it's always been there but it keeps, it's come to the surface because of the fact that (inaudible) just e-mailed me. (LAUGHTER) [00:28:05]
THERAPIST: It depends on... Well too revealing means you're revealing more than you want to. So...
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't want to reveal. So, yeah. But if I say, "I just want to see the city through your eyes, is that like flirting? Or is that? [00:30:05]
THERAPIST: Do you feel anxious about your comment to him?
CLIENT: Yeah. But I mean, he didn't respond for like twenty days or something and then he responded and not directly to anything to anything but he just send me a bunch of pictures of some director we had scanned from a book he was reading. So I also ignored the e-mail. You know? And then this week ","P1-N400DB1":"he wrote, back, "Did you get the pictures? (LAUGHTER) I was like, "No. Go away." And then I was like, "Yeah. I did. Thank you," and then we again started exchanging e-mails so...
THERAPIST: Well, he certainly awakens this, "Maybe there's a chance for something else."
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) I mean, it's been a year. Why can't I just get over... I guess I was over. Like until he contacted, contacts me. I try not think about it and think less and less. Then as soon as he does, like all of it is back. So maybe it's just too soon, you know, maybe it'll take me a few years. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Maybe it's an antidote to your feeling that no one else could love you. He comes into the picture and you think, "Well, maybe he could love me." [00:32:01]
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I know that he can't. So...
THERAPIST: But in your relationship with David you're really coasting.
CLIENT: Coasting?
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: As in?
THERAPIST: You're not, you're not using your driving controls. You're not going in forward, reverse, braking. You're just coasting.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Your foot's not on the pedal. Your foot's not on the brake. You're just coasting.
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) (LAUGHTER) I think we're both coasting. I don't either of us are driving and, or braking or...
THERAPIST: That's very true but he's not my patient.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Yeah.
THERAPIST: I care about his well being in a general sense but... [00:33:01]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...his psychological growth and development is not my, part of my job.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: I agree with your assessment. (PAUSE) But my guess is also that you want something different than this. Not necessarily even different than him, maybe different from him, but certainly different from the relationship you have right now.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And this might be... Aside from the commitment piece, this might be exactly what he wants.
CLIENT: What?
THERAPIST: This kind of relationship.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think it is.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [00:34:01]
CLIENT: Someone who doesn't take him in any direction. The relationship is in auto pilot right?
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: And he can just focus 98 percent on work. And I don't find anything wrong with that. I used to. A year ago I found that repulsive. Maybe I still have, I find it weird and odd but I've come to appreciate that because I know it takes... I know what hard work is now (LAUGHTER) in a sense. So... ","P1-N4011D1":"He's cut out for ambitious things so I shouldn't be in his way, you know? So...
THERAPIST: I don't know. People can be very ambitious but also be deeply connected and emotionally invested in the people around them. You see these things as opposites (inaudible)
CLIENT: No I don't. I don't. I know there, there are those people and I know them. [00:35:00]
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: But David is not one of them.
THERAPIST: Well, you were saying before, "Well, he is in academia so maybe he just doesn't have time."
CLIENT: No. I'm... I still stick by my statement that they don't have a lot of, you know, frivolous time to do various things. Well maybe they do. Some of them do (inaudible at 00:35:25) but... Yeah. I don't know. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) I think it's time to ask my mom to be like, "Can you find some work? ","P1-N401291":"Even if it's like slightly menial."
THERAPIST: Yes. You're way too needy.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) It could be true. I mean, like, I might just be going through a weird phase and, you know, if I'm strong enough then I won't need that emotional connection. [00:37:01]
THERAPIST: I feel like that's wishful thinking.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It's wishful thinking because if that were true, then you wouldn't have to do anything different. You could just stay with David and do what's comfortable.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: He doesn't value fun things.
CLIENT: Why not?
THERAPIST: I don't know. You could ask him.
CLIENT: I'm tired, I'm really tired of having, you know, stupid frivolous conversations with him. (LAUGHTER) Seven years and it's not very ridiculous talking to him about anything non-intellectual or just funny and (inaudible) I go with all this, "You'll get this answer," this, that. And I know it's ","P1-N401451":"like stupid. (LAUGHTER) And so... [00:39:19]
THERAPIST: Like an answer in why he doesn't like fun things?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That was the most emotion I saw from you today.
CLIENT: What?
THERAPIST: What you just said, "I'm sick of this." I don't know.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Frustration is more emotion than I saw from you today so far.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Today, not in general.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What I, what I said earlier about like I'm not buying this product, I do feel you go into these times where you're trying to sell yourself and me on some life philosophy.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And, about what you should be able to do without. I don't think you're buying. You're not a convincing spokesperson because you don't buy it either. You just sort of give it lip service.
CLIENT: Hmm. Maybe that's true. I mean, I'm not making it up. But I... I guess I just objectively appreciate it, not emotionally. (LAUGHTER) It's like, "This is a really righteous product. It looks good sitting there." (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Well, and alone is relative because you have a lot of people in your life.
CLIENT: I do?
THERAPIST: You're not sure?
CLIENT: Well I have like community people now. I mean, I don't like... I mean, I care about their well being but in a general sense. We don't connect emotionally, not all the time. What?
THERAPIST: Well I was going to say, I don't know the word, but you certainly have lots of groups yeah, in your life whom you're connected to.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Maybe you don't feel you have a lot of people you're connected to one on one but I'm not sure that's a...
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:42:45) actually.
THERAPIST: Fine. When you say, that's fun?
CLIENT: Well like I, I like (inaudible) connections. Like with my roommate, I definitely have an emotional connection. She and I, we get each other, like all of my roommates do. (LAUGHTER) Yeah, like that woman, the mother and daughter, we connect emotionally but also intellectually. [00:44:15]
THERAPIST: She fed you pie.
CLIENT: Yes. (LAUGHTER) It's funny. I want to keep breaking down just so I can be nurtured like that.
THERAPIST: Maybe you don't have to break down to be nurtured like that.
CLIENT: But it's real fun (LAUGHTER) that intensity. It's fun but it's also ridiculously embarrassing.
THERAPIST: Well maybe that's what makes you feel needy because you feel like that's the only way to sort of generate that kind of connection.
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess if I get more of that, you know, on regular basis, maybe I won't feel like breaking down all the time. (LAUGHTER) [00:45:00]
THERAPIST: Like how do people feel nurtured without this sense of desperation or urgency?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Getting a piece of pie every day?
CLIENT: Maybe not every day. (LAUGHTER) Every week. (LAUGHTER) Yeah, I don't know about David does it. Maybe he's just a very strong person but I feel like I want that proverbial and literal piece of pie. Like he doesn't. You've seen him, right. He's like reed thin. No, literally he's reed thin and ","P1-N401991":"he has no, not much of an appetite for food or life or emotions. Mine is much bigger. We'll stop. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: We do need to stop for today. I will see you on Wednesday. [00:46:01]
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: (inaudible) (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Take care.
CLIENT: You too.
