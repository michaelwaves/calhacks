DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her lack of desire to go to class and therapy, as she just wants to work and not have to deal with outside distractions. Client and therapist discuss how things will work during the therapist's maternity leave.
CLIENT: I don’t feel like talking.
THERAPIST: No?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Are you upset?
CLIENT: No, I just want…have like so much to do. I feel like I just want to get to work. [Laughs.] [Pause.]
THERAPIST: Are you on strike?
CLIENT: [Laughs.] No. Like, trying to think of something to talk about. It’s like no…[pause.]. Had such a hard time getting up this morning. It’s been like really sleepy and fatigued. I don’t know. Not because of any physical exertion. Just like, I think mental. And not even…I’m ","P1-N400191":"not even working. I’m just kind of like scared. I just want to sleep the whole time. I had hopes to work yesterday, like in the evening, but just like couldn’t…just like all these people make demands on my time and I feel like so burdened.
THERAPIST: Maybe.
CLIENT: How do you do that, though? How does, when it’s changing perspective completely, but how does it work? Like my mom calls me right now about lunch. How is it not a burden? How do I think it’s really about it? How is it like for my benefit? You know, it’s like her expectation ","P1-N4002B1":"instead of, “Hey, would you like free lunch?” It doesn’t sound a nice little lunch. It sounds like medicine or a sentence; an obligation. As it does to class, as it does I do a lot of things. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: Where are you right now?
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: Where are you right now?
CLIENT: Well I’m talking. Like…
THERAPIST: You are.
CLIENT: There is a thread. [Laughs.] No.
THERAPIST: You seem distracted.
CLIENT: Well I’m thinking. I’m not like thinking about this thread and how to connect everything through it. So. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: It’s like you feel everyone wants a piece of me.
CLIENT: Well I wish that would make me feel flattered. [Laughs.] [Pause.]
THERAPIST: It would only make you feel flattered if you felt they were interested in you vs. what they need from you.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.] Yeah, I don’t understand. What is the…I mean it sounds like a subtle difference. But what is the difference?
THERAPIST: Well, the first is valuing you, for you and who you are vs. what you can do for them. Function, you said.
CLIENT: I mean, I guess, for my mom, I’m like the child or someone she can share her meal with. So I feel like bad, I guess. But with my friend, I was like, I really didn’t want to talk, but I felt obligated to talk, you know, even though she did seem interested and like, yeah, you’re ","P1-N400551":"a good writer. Yeah, you look good in that skirt, you know. Yeah, you should do this or you should do that. And she said all of these things to me, like it wasn’t like she just kept talking about herself. But it was just like you know, like I was working on my homework and she called and I shouldn’t ","P1-N400552":"have spoken to her right then, but I couldn’t not pick her phone. So.
THERAPIST: Why couldn’t you not?
CLIENT: I don’t know like. So she’d call like Friday night or like text and I just walked in to a bar with my friends so I couldn’t talk to her then. And then I called her over the weekend, and she wasn’t there. We just kept missing each other, but I felt like I should talk with her.
THERAPIST: But you feel like you don’t have a choice. Like you feel like if you want to pick up, because she’s been trying to reach you. You don’t feel like you can say I would love to talk, but now is not a good time. Maybe we can find a time over the next week. You don’t feel ","P1-N4005F1":"you can do that. And then you feel like somehow she’s put you in this position that you can’t say no.
CLIENT: Yeah, it feels that way. But I don’t know how to get out of that. I don’t know how to say those words. Hey, I can’t talk right now. I mean I feel like I have said them. I mean I guess it’s easier to text those words than to say them.
THERAPIST: What is it about saying them?
CLIENT: I don’t know. I never felt it. It doesn’t feel right.
THERAPIST: What does it feel like?
CLIENT: You know. Like mean or something selfish. Self-important, which I sometimes don’t feel like it’s earned because I feel, I don’t know, bloated or fat or like stupid or subordinate. You know. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: Give the impression that?
CLIENT: That I’m like not talking and not communicating and all that. I spoke in class. Like I was loud and everything and yeah; on several occasions. But then my professor still sent me an e-mail after class saying why aren’t you talking? Why are you like scribbling on the paper? Talk to ","P1-N400771":"me. I was like – I did reply to him – I said, I did talk. I was just thinking.
THERAPIST: I think there are times you’re disengaged that you may not realize that that’s what you’re conveying.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Well that case it sounded like you were really getting annoyed.
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: In that case, yesterday, you were annoyed with her.
CLIENT: Yeah, I was very pissed. I went and asked the receptionist, how much longer is it going to be? And she just kind of, you know, looked away and I got so mad. I was like, okay, yeah; ignore me. And she’s like, “I’m looking at the chart.” And then she came out and she was ","P1-N400891":"like, “I was looking at the chart.” And I’m like well you made no show of, you denied [inaudible – 32:16] like you even heard me. That had like a little fire in [inaudible – 32:24]. Sorry. I don’t know. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: Well it’s hard to be engaged when you feel at times you don’t want to be somewhere or you have to be somewhere because you’re obligated to be; you don’t want to be.
CLIENT: Yeah. You can’t change. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: What was he referring to?
CLIENT: Just what happened with that woman and her father. I guess he was talking to a friend and it came up because he was like, the same circle and that friend knows this woman. So, I guess, the friend was asking Chris or talked to Bryce and Chris was just saying I don’t want to see her and ","P1-N4009F1":"then Chris told him what happened and I guess the friend was talking more like or saying something like wrong; it wasn’t right or something. And he came and apologized that he didn’t respond to the e-mail because she accused me and stuff. I’m like as you know, you’re kind and ","P1-N4009F2":"you didn’t do…I don’t expect you to do anything different, you know. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: No. You brought up on Monday something we haven’t really talked about very much to this point, maternity leave and the logistics of maybe how you feel about it. You might want to make sure we can talk about it today and continue to talk about it.
CLIENT: Sure, yeah. When is the leave?
THERAPIST: So, assuming all goes as planned, I’ll be here through the third week of June, which is I think June 16th is that Monday. I think that’s so…through that week. And then I’ll be out. And what I hope to do is come in a day or so a week starting at the end of July so that ","P1-N400AB1":"I would at least be able to see you once a week. But I will e-mail you probably mid-July just to let you know how things are going.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And I’ll also have someone covering for me should anything come up. Or if you wanted to see someone in the interim, you could do that too. We could talk about that.
CLIENT: Okay. Yeah, I hope there are no crises. [Laughs.] But, yeah. I was actually thinking we could do once a week in May, just because I feel kind of, as we talked about, burdened about so many things.
THERAPIST: That’s a terrible idea.
CLIENT: Yeah? Why?
THERAPIST: I mean I’m seeing the tongue and cheek, and I mean that. And I’m also aware that my saying you should come in more and then you feeling obligated to do so is itself a dynamic. [Pause.]
CLIENT: Yeah. No, I think I have two more weeks of classes and maybe once the classes are over I’ll feel less stressed out.
THERAPIST: So tell me about, you know, “I hope there’s not a crisis.” Tell me about that feeling.
CLIENT: Yeah, I was just being funny. But like, yeah, I don’t think so. Like everything is stable. Yeah. What would a crisis look like? I think crisis, in my case, would be something really unexpected. Like what happened last summer. And I don’t anticipate something like that happening because ","P1-N400BF1":"I don’t think I’m going anywhere.
THERAPIST: But even in that circumstance, you didn’t contact me.
CLIENT: [Laughs.]
THERAPIST: I’m not being like…I mean a very serious…
CLIENT: Yeah, but I didn’t know right. Like I was in India and I didn’t know…I honestly don’t understand like the dynamics between me and you, like as my therapist. I don’t understand like how much we’re supposed to communicate when we’re not actually in session.
THERAPIST: We did have Skype the year before though, so we did communicate…
CLIENT: Yeah, because we talked about doing that because those were sessions, right. I don’t know…because I’ve told you like I’m going away for two months. How am I supposed to like…? I don’t know like I could like e-mail you in the middle and say, “Hey, I’m ","P1-N400CD1":"just, you know. Can we Skype?”
THERAPIST: I’m your therapist not only in these sessions, but I’m your therapist. And if you need to contact me, you can contact me. You can always contact me.
CLIENT: I didn’t know that. [Laughs nervously.]
THERAPIST: Well maybe I should have made that more explicit. But I am always…I mean. It almost…I feel like, I mean, some of it is just your needing to have, obviously, more information than I’m realizing. I wonder if some of it is connected to what we were talking about on Monday. ","P1-N400D31":"Like are we connected and like are you just present for these sessions, or is there like a connection that’s ongoing throughout whether we’re in each other’s presence or not? And there is certainly a highly…there’s a highly structured format to our relationship and I appreciate ","P1-N400D32":"that. So there’s not peace, but there’s sort of like this ongoing like how you feel connected to me or other people outside. And I’m your therapist in here, outside of here. If you need me, you can reach out to me. We’ll figure out a way to be in contact and for us to talk or ","P1-N400D33":"meet or whatever. And that’s always true.
CLIENT: Oh okay. I didn’t know that.
THERAPIST: It is always true. It is…my maternity leave is definitely, you know, a bit of an anomaly in that sense. You can still…certainly after a week or so I’ll be checking e-mail to again. You can certainly feel free to e-mail me. I will also have someone covering for me who will ","P1-N400D71":"be more consistently present. But like I said, by, hopefully by mid-July I hope to e-mail you and let you know kind of the deal in terms of, okay, I think I can be back third or fourth week and come in for an hour or so here and there. So that’s what I hope to do.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: But I like to be available as much as possible. And for some reason, like maternity leave, I can’t be, I’ll have someone else who’s available to you.
CLIENT: Okay. That would be helpful. Yeah. Thank you.
THERAPIST: You will not be alone.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t feel alone as much because I’ve like [inaudible – 47;36] to be more self-reliant. So yeah. I don’t like…
THERAPIST: But the question…so that’s true, and that’s good. But the question for you is it’s not simply about sort of over-relying, but it’s about feeling reliant, how people rely on each other in ways that feel burdensome, rather than relying on ways in which you feel ","P1-N400E51":"sort of like people want…like they want to take care of you. They want to take care of each other. They don’t feel obligated to. It doesn’t feel shackled. There’s not simply, in my mind for you, just relying less on people. Like that’s the goal per se. But it’s a ","P1-N400E52":"different kind of reliance.
CLIENT: Yeah, I see that. Like last night I was like after my long phone conversation and multiple…I was ridiculously distracted and trying to work on this poem and like it just wasn’t coming together. And I wrote this e-mail to my professor and I wondered about sending it and I wondered ","P1-N400E71":"if that sending it meant how I turned…how, in here, you say you turn to me when you don’t, you know, when you’re confused or whatever.
THERAPIST: Well we do need to stop here. I will see you on Monday, okay.
CLIENT: Okay, thank you.
THERAPIST: You were great.
CLIENT: Have a good week.
THERAPIST: Thank you. Take care.
