TITLE: Client "C" Therapy Session Audio Recording, August 14, 2012: Client has an unhealthy relationship with food that stems back to being obese as a child.
DESCRIPTION: Client has an unhealthy relationship with food that stems back to being obese as a child.
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in. I'm just going to adjust the air.
CLIENT: Okay. Thank you.
CLIENT: It's been a while.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: A lot going on. Number one, me and my girlfriend are on a new diet. We've been on it for six days. It's called "Seven Day Detox" where I have been eating nothing but fruits and vegetables. I've lost about fifteen pounds.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: I feel really good about myself.
THERAPIST: That's a lot of weight.
CLIENT: Yeah. In six days.
THERAPIST: Whoa!
CLIENT: So well that's going well. The job search is not going well. I feel like I've been denied a lot more than I anticipated. And the denial is really triggering some old feelings about wanting to use, wanting to eat, wanting to not be disciplined like I've been. And it's to the point where I'm just ","P1-N400211":"getting very frustrated, very agitated. [00:01:27]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And for me it hurts because, you know, as we talked about in a couple of previous ones is I feel like (sigh), I feel like I'm not good enough for positions. And then when I don't get them it just reinforces in my head that I am not good enough.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And the doubt of my ability comes in and, you know, that's when the feelings of depression kick in, I guess. And that's when the feelings of, "Do I want to use? Do I want to eat? Do I want to " You know, I want something to help me clear my mind and help me move forward and take the next step ","P1-N4002B1":"into being the person that I want to be. [00:02:37]
THERAPIST: Hm.
CLIENT: And it's still not there. And then I get (sigh) kind of depressed again and I just move on and eventually I just fight through the hunger, fight through the urge and move forward. But it's been one of the most difficult last four weeks that I've definitely had to go through. [00:06:00]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: So with that being said, my moving forward is, and this is the struggle that I deal with, is I'm going to be an coach. I'm going to try and be some sort of coach in the school. And that's going to be fantastic because that's going to be a resume builder for me. Which I'm looking for right now ","P1-N4004F1":"is a resume builder.
THERAPIST: Do you have a savings? Or how are you managing [your bills] (ph)?
CLIENT: I do have some savings, yes.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And no matter what, and this has been, this was cemented into my head even before time (ph), is whatever I have in my account I put twenty five dollars away every week no matter what. And I put that into my savings account. Even if I know I need that twenty five dollars, I'll find a way to make ","P1-N4005B1":"up twenty five dollars because I know that I need that for me later on.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And I know eventually one day I'll get it back up to where I'd like to be ideally. Yeah. And that's not a problem with me right now. For me, right now is my success in me living a healthy life is more important to me right now than money. My girlfriend and I have had this conversation for a ","P1-N400611":"long time now. You know?
THERAPIST: Ideologically?
CLIENT: Ideologically?
THERAPIST: Ideo? (ph)
CLIENT: Yeah, something like that. Like processing all the information from the situations.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And thinking about them has made me a better person that I am today. It's made me realize that there are more important things than, (laughs) you know, money right now. [00:13:32]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And when I get the temptations. And when, you know, the negative stuff that's coming into my life is still coming in. It's difficult for me because I want to just jump ship so bad. I want to jump off course. I want to run back to the things that made me forget about stuff. The things that made ","P1-N4007D1":"me, you know, things that made the old me comfortable. [00:15:41]
THERAPIST: I'm sorry.
CLIENT: No. Go ahead.
THERAPIST: Well, I was thinking that you have this real hopeful side about what your future could look like. And then you have this side that you feel sort of dragging you down.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: I'm not sure how the two of those go together.
CLIENT: (sigh) I think they go together because the hopeful side is the real me. The hopeful side is the person who wants to help everybody who helps them self. Who wants to be successful. And then the person that drags me down is the person that's been abused.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: Not physically, but mentally for so many years. Who has been abused emotionally for so many years. Just the lack of confidence that that person dragging me down has really, really is difficult to let go of. [00:16:50]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: "Well, she's not here. I get to eat her portion."
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And my mother and my father would allow that and they'd say it was okay. And just constantly even when I was younger even though, like I said, my mother was depressed, who still is depressed. Her way of coping with it was eating. [00:18:10]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Because I didn't know right from wrong back then. I didn't know that I couldn't eat it or should eat it or shouldn't eat it. I didn't know that. But now that I do know what I should and shouldn't eat, I still choose to eat what I shouldn't eat because it's what I grew up with.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Whatever I wanted I had it. And that's not the thing that I wanted. What I really wanted, I guess, was to feel worthy, was to feel loved, to feel like, you know, I was someone who could make a difference. And (laughs) growing up I guess I really didn't feel like that.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: Because I had all these excuses to fall back on. I had all these ways, the way that I lived, to fall back on. And I had all this negativity that was feeding me constantly for year after year after year. And I think it's just tough for me to just let all that negativity go when I've been living ","P1-N400AD1":"with it for, you know, so many years. [00:20:31]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And it's difficult because, you know, I still see it when I go home today to my parents and when I stop down. It's just nothing has changed. Nothing has changed. And, you know, I finally moved back in full time with my girlfriend.
THERAPIST: Mm. Really?
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: When did that happen?
CLIENT: It happened middle of, first week of July.
THERAPIST: Hm.
CLIENT: And I told her once I did it is, "I couldn't do it anymore." I realize now what I want and I want her. And I want to start a new life without my parents, without my siblings, you know, living with me. Because from this point on moving forward, you know, she is my family. And I want us to have, ","P1-N400BD1":"you know, a happy life together. And I want us to do the right things. [00:21:34]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And that all started from when I was three and four years old. That's when the weight started coming on and, you know, my girlfriend just pulled out [old packet] (ph) of one of my birthdays. And one of my aunts got me a gallon jar of red raspberry jelly as a birthday present. And I was already, ","P1-N400C51":"you know, a heavy, obese child.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And when I smiled I was so happy that I got it. My eyes were closed and I had like three chins. Looking at it it really disturbed me.
THERAPIST: How old were you?
CLIENT: I was probably twelve or thirteen.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: It really disturbed me. And even my girlfriend said, "Who got you a jar of jelly for your birthday?" And I think about it now and I'm like, "Yeah, why would they do that?" I mean and I remember it now that I saw the picture, I remember getting that jar of jelly and I remember that it was gone ","P1-N400D11":"in a week. [00:23:38]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And that's difficult for me because anytime I feel stress, anytime I feel down that's what I want to turn to. Before it was the assault. And I still feel, you know, I still feel like I'm turning that way. I still feel like I want to smoke. I get that craving. I get the tobacco craving on a daily ","P1-N400D71":"basis. And I almost, every time I almost, almost cave in. [00:24:37]
THERAPIST: What made you give it back to him? What enabled you to do that?
CLIENT: Just thinking what me and my girlfriend have started.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: Her reminding me, "You don't need this stuff. It's not for you. Let it go. It's not for you. Keep going." You know? "Keep going." And that's the support that I've, you know, looked for. That's the support that I've wanted for so long. And it's the support that I'm finally getting that's making ","P1-N400E11":"me understand more about what life is about. What the positives of life. I mean, (sigh) growing up it was all negatives and it was all feeling sorry for yourself. [00:25:41]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: Because it's there. Like I said, everything that I've done, that I know, it's all there. And the hardest part of it is not doing it. I know, you know, as part of my treatment for assault was I deleted all my numbers from my phone. And I had to avoid the people that were most subject to put me ","P1-N400E91":"in a bad environment. And that was all my best friends from college. [00:26:58]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I never really got punished growing up. I was never grounded.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I never really got anything taken away from me. I was always bribed. "If you do this, we'll get you this system." "If you this I'll get you this for dinner." [00:29:18]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And now that I look back on it it's been extremely difficult trying to lose weight in that house. I remember when I had lost my hundred and something pounds, you know, senior in high school going into freshman year college. That was one of the most difficult years of my life.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Because there were days where I'd work out, and I worked out every day for two plus hours. I busted my tail. And then I'd come home and I'd eat but I'd eat normally. And then there would be times where I wouldn't eat for a whole day. I'd go twenty four hours without eating.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I'd work out, I'd do everything, because I knew what we're having the next night that I really wanted to indulge in because it was one of the better meals that I really did like growing up. And I did. I'd not eat for twenty four hours, which was very difficult. I shouldn't have done that. But ","P1-N401051":"then come dinner time I ate like I never saw food before. [00:30:28]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: But I felt like it was okay because it was two days worth of calories as opposed to one.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And that's the mentality that I thought of.
THERAPIST: Well you're describing sort of difficulty regulating yourself.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: Not too much, not too little.
CLIENT: Mm hm. I do. I can't. And I have a lot of difficulty even now with portions.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: There's tons of times where I'm good. I know how much to eat and I eat it before, but there's extra there. And I still go and eat it.
THERAPIST: Well it sounds like you bounce between feeling pride and feeling guilty. Like you go toward these things when you're feeling deprived and you want to be filled up and you want.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: And then you feel guilty for taking too much or wanting even too much.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: And so then you feel guilty and want to kind of abstain. [00:31:26]
CLIENT: Mm hm. No, I agree. I agree. And, like you, I'm trying to figure out why. I'm trying to figure out why I overindulge. I'm trying to figure out why I feel deprived when I don't have them. You know? And it bothers me because now that I'm on this detox, you know, I'm watching food shows. And my ","P1-N401251":"girlfriend is like, "Why are you doing this?" I go, "I don't know."
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Because I think watching them and watching other people, it helps me a little bit. Because I see, you know, how good and greasy and fatty that food is. And it makes me want it then, but I know I have no way of getting it. So then for me it's okay because then I usually watch them at night before ","P1-N401291":"I go to bed. I'll go to sleep and I'll either dream about them or I'll just sleep through the night and then the next morning I'll forget about it. [00:32:33]
THERAPIST: Dream about?
CLIENT: The food.
THERAPIST: Hm.
CLIENT: Dream about, you know, how good that tastes. And then that's a way of me eating it. You know? It's just how I process things.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: It's how I get over, you know, not eating it. And that's the one thing that my girlfriend has asked me over and over again is, "You know you can't eat it. Why are you watching it?" And I don't know what it is but there's something that brings me back to the same channel over and over again.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And makes me want it more and more and more. (laughs) I have no explanation for it. I really don't. I can't say it's habit because it hasn't been. I haven't been doing that for twenty plus years. But I have been seeing delicious food like that for twenty plus years. I have been seeing, you know, ","P1-N401391":"the cakes, the cookies, the chicken parms (ph), the French fries and the sandwiches with the heavy mayonnaise and stuff like that. [00:33:46]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I'm afraid that they are just going to run out on me like some people did. For a while. And believe it or not, I don't know why it just popped into my head, but that's what I fear, that I'm never going to get them again.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And I don't want to feel like that. I don't want to feel like the way that people ran out on me before. I don't want to feel, you know, like I don't have them there. You know? And this is just crazy. It's popping in my head. I have a thing for ketchup. Ketchup is like one of my best friends. ","P1-N401431":"And not having ketchup, I don't know if I could live. I mean I could. But just not having it because I enjoy it so much, it's scary. [00:35:03]
THERAPIST: What do you like about it?
CLIENT: The taste. How it makes me feel. I like, you know, just to have with everything. It's like my "go to" condiment.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I have it with everything. Wherever I've gone and eaten it's always been there.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And this is crazy how it just popped in, but it is. it's like one of It's like losing, you know, one of your good friends.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And I don't want that because I've already had that experience. And I don't want to experience that again. I guess that's why I'm having difficulty letting go of the addiction to food. Because I do have some kind of relationship with it, I guess.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: Where it's, you know, kind of on a personal level.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: I mean, when I was younger my mother couldn't keep ketchup in the house fast enough before I'd eat it. I'd eat it with everything. [00:36:11]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I still eat it with everything. You know? It just brings me back to another memory. My aunt used to call me "The Ketchup King."
THERAPIST: Hm.
CLIENT: And I used to (laughs), you know I used to think it was amusing, but I used to eat a ton of ketchup.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I still do. You know? I mean I've cut back a lot but ketchup is, you know, if ketchup was a human I'd consider him a friend.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And I guess that's, you know, moving forward is (sigh) all the other food is not as friendly as ketchup. Because I know ketchup in the end is not going to harm me. But I know the other stuff can and will eventually. And that's what I'm kind of feeling now, you know, moving forward with my life ","P1-N4016B1":"is I do want a sidekick by me. I do want someone to be there with me as I take that next step forward. [00:37:20]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Or if the next step is really good, how am I going to handle it? You know? I'm still, I'm at a crossroads there. If it's really bad do I sink down in the dumps and do I revert back to eating and drinking and assaulting again? Or if it's really good do I continue on the path that I'm taking. ","P1-N401711":"Taking the next step to better myself.
THERAPIST: One thing, I don't mean to change the topic, came to my mind.
CLIENT: Oh.
THERAPIST: I'm struck that you didn't bring up moving back in full time with your girlfriend until now. I know we haven't met, but that seems like a really big deal.
CLIENT: No, it is. It's a gigantic deal. I guess because there's such so much other stuff going on I didn't (laughs), I didn't really put it as an important piece as part of my treatment. But it has been a very, very emotional, very successful move in.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: You know, at first she demanded the ring. You know? And I said, "Okay." But, you know, now we are in serious talks about being engaged. You know, with my grandmother passing I got my inheritance and I'm going to use that towards an engagement ring. So, you know, eventually we're going to take ","P1-N4017F1":"the next step forward. But, you know, I'm just waiting for the right moment to do it. [00:39:24]
THERAPIST: Which grandmother?
CLIENT: My Dad's grandmother.
THERAPIST: When did she die?
CLIENT: In June. We had that conversation. We met the Tuesday after the funeral.
THERAPIST: Oh. That's right. But yeah, this feeling of -
CLIENT: Yeah. That's alright.
THERAPIST: not being caught up.
CLIENT: No, that's alright. That's alright. You know, with her passing, you know, I feel like I'm ready to make the next move. And I don't know if I brought this up, but my cousin, my aunt's son, got married the Saturday we got back from vacation. And we couldn't meet on that Tuesday because I was working ","P1-N4018F1":"with my Dad. That wedding that happened -
THERAPIST: I remember you talked about it a lot.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So that was just last week?
CLIENT: That was two weeks ago.
THERAPIST: Okay. Because I haven't seen you in like three weeks.
CLIENT: I didn't attend.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: I did not attend. And coming back from the wedding all I got was negative feedback. Was how it was this, how this was bad, how they couldn't believe the outfits that they were wearing, they couldn't believe the food. They couldn't believe that my cousin got engaged to his girlfriend at the wedding. ","P1-N4019F1":"There was just a lot of negativity coming out of this. [00:40:41]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: You know? Because that's what I've tried so hard to not do. And what I've worked so hard to overcome is the negativeness. And it's to the point now where I just block it out to the best of my ability. There are times where I just get frustrated and I'll just chime in. But there are other times ","P1-N401A71":"where I just try zone out. I try to completely block it from even being a topic of discussion for me. And it's irritating.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: It's really irritating. You know? Because I understand it was bad. I knew it was going to be bad from the get go because all you were talking about was how you didn't want to go, and how you hate my cousin and this that and the other thing. I know that. And I ask them the question. I go, "Why ","P1-N401AB1":"did you go? You didn't have to go. You didn't choose to go." [00:42:39]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And for me the thought process behind it is the same as going into this wedding. You know? I just don't want to be hurt anymore and I don't want to support people that have hurt me.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And that's finally what my Dad's finally recognizing. I think he realizes the hurt that's been brought out. That's finally coming. You know, and it's to the point where, like we've discussed, where I don't care. You know? People ask me, "Why didn't you attend the wedding? Why aren't you going?" ","P1-N401B51":"And I tell them, "I've got personal issues." You know? It's none of their business why I'm going or why I'm not going. I don't understand why it's a big deal. You know? [00:43:46]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: It's my personal choice. I don't need to explain myself to people. And that pisses me off. (laughs) That's when I get pissed off. When people start butting into to why I'm not doing things. Because that really irritates me.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And it pushes my buttons. It's to the point where that's when, you know, it's none of your business. And when they don't get the answer that they like, then they keep pushing.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And keep pushing. And that's difficult for me because then I get the frustration and then I get the buildup. And something extraordinarily bad is going to happen. And I know it is. [00:44:49]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And that's why I avoid, you know, my uncle and my aunt and my cousins. Because I just have all this anger built up over the years towards them. And now my grandmother is not here to defend them.
THERAPIST: You know, Jordan, I don't mean to interrupt but we do need to stop for today.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So I was going to ask you just, so I'm not here next week and we usually meet every other week.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: Would you be able to come the following week.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Just for the following week, on Thursday afternoon. Is that a possibility?
CLIENT: Thursday? Sure. What day is that?
THERAPIST: I think that's the thirtieth.
CLIENT: Perfect.
THERAPIST: I think I have, let's see, I don't have 3:15 but I'm pretty sure I have 3:45.
CLIENT: That works.
THERAPIST: Would 3:45 work?
CLIENT: Yeah, that works.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So the thirtieth and 3:45.
THERAPIST: The thirtieth at 3:45.
CLIENT: Terrific.
THERAPIST: Great. (pause) Oh, thank you very much.
CLIENT: Yep. That's for you.
THERAPIST: Very good. And I'll see you in two weeks.
CLIENT: Alrighty. Thank you. (ph).
THERAPIST: Okay. Take care.
