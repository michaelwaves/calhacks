DESCRIPTION: Client accepted a new job, but is upset that his mother reacted negatively toward this. Client discusses the impact his negativity has on his life and the relationship with his family.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Good things happened though.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I recently just accepted a job offer.
THERAPIST: Congratulations.
CLIENT: Thank you. I'm going to be starting off as a coach at school in Newton. So, after we can talk about times.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: I'd like to keep the Tuesday if we could just push it back to 3:30, I believe I could make that.
THERAPIST: I think I can do that. I'll take a look at it after we're done.
CLIENT: Okay. Just double check. Yeah, because I'm in Newton and it would take me like 20 minutes to get here. So, that's the other good thing. That's one of the good things. The second good thing is that I'm sticking with the diet and I'm continuing to lose weight which is very positive for me. There ","P1-N4001D1":"is still that negative aspect that's in my life when I'm with my parents. The other day we were talking and I was over there prepping my grandmother's house to be sold and I keep hearing my dad say if the price isn't right I'm going to buy it. When he says that, I get very angry. I get very, very, angry. ","P1-N4001D2":"I tell him, no I want it. Nobody wants it. Why would you say that? Why are you buying it? Well, Tim wants it. No, he doesn't. Tim's my older brother. No, he doesn't. He can't afford it. Let him find his own place. I go he can't even move out of the house and he's going to buy a house? [00:01:30]
THERAPIST: I'm sorry, who would he be bailing out? Your brother?
CLIENT: He would be bailing out my aunts, his sister and his brother's wife. He'd be bailing them out because he'd be giving them their share of the money and he'd be keeping the house for what reason? [00:04:00]
THERAPIST: You don't think he wants the house?
CLIENT: He doesn't. He's just doing it because it's cheap and he's not going to sell it to anybody else cheaper. I said why? I just don't understand the logic in why you would keep it. My brother is one man. He's going to be living in a twenty five hundred square foot house by himself. Well, go get ","P1-N400291":"a roomie. I go tell him to get an apartment with a roommate. It just really bothers me how he does stuff like this.
THERAPIST: Does it bother you that he's willing to pay for your brother's rent?
CLIENT: No. It bothers me that he's willing to pay off his brothers and his sisters just to keep the house on principle. That's what bothers me. It bothers me how he's always the one who's like this is an investment property for you when we've explained numerous times, well, at least I have, I don't ","P1-N4002D1":"want it. He had a three family in Hamden and we saw the nonsense that it took to run a three family and he got mad at us because we didn't want, well that's why I kept it. I go I don't want to live in Hamden. I don't want to be a landlord. If I did I would have bought my own stuff. I don't want it. ","P1-N4002D2":"And, I think this is just part of me trying to become independent from him. Trying to be my own man. [00:05:30]
THERAPIST: You don't feel he has the capacity to protect himself? [00:06:30]
CLIENT: No. I feel he's very weak and he's soft and because of his sickness, I think he is very soft and he's not making, you know, rational decisions. He just does what he wants to do and I told him, I go that's fine, but I won't speak to you. I know that's really going to hurt them, but I need to ","P1-N400331":"keep my guns on this. I need to find something that gets their attention because I feel over the years that's the one thing I have been yearning for is for their attention. To finally listen to me. Hey, I don't want to be fat anymore. Hey, don't do this. It's a bad decision for all of us. Why do you ","P1-N400332":"keep doing this? Hello. You're hurting me even more. You know, I feel like this is my call for help to them to finally realize hello, I'm here. You know. You say you love me. You say you do all this stuff, so why? I feel like it's false. I feel like you don't really, you know, value my opinion when ","P1-N400333":"we're looking out for your best interest and I feel like my brothers and my sisters buy in to their nonsense, their negativity. You know, everything that's going on they just buy in to it because it's all that we have been fed and I really, really I get irritated by it. [00:08:00]
THERAPIST: Do you feel that they're betraying you?
CLIENT: I just feel like they're pushing my buttons.
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: By saying this stuff. I mean why would this thought even come in to their heads? We've already expressed, well, I've already expressed, how negative that house is. How much it means to me to get it out of my life and to move on. For me, if my plea can't get through to them, then I'm sorry I ","P1-N4003F1":"don't know what to do because this is the battle that I have been dealing with for all my life. This is the struggle that I wasn't, you know, I didn't see clearly until a couple months ago when I started putting things in to perspective and thinking about the situation I'm being put in. I never really ","P1-N4003F2":"saw it until now. Until now. It really brings out the anger in me. It really brings out the rage because I don't have the rage towards, you know, my girlfriend anymore. I have nothing but love for her and I support her 100% just like she supports me. [00:12:00]
THERAPIST: What would happen if you don't get the support you would like? [00:15:00]
CLIENT: I would probably do like I said. I wouldn't be around. I wouldn't be around. As tough as that would be, I really wouldn't because it is very difficult. When all I have, I have all this positive energy around me and all these positives happen, happening to me, to have well, you didn't do this. ","P1-N400491":"You didn't do that. Why didn't you have me do this with you? Are you sure this is what you want to do? Why are you questioning this? Why are you putting these negative thoughts in my head? Why are you putting this doubt in my head? Yes, it's what I want to do. That's why I did it. [00:16:00]
THERAPIST: It sounds like by choosing, by them making the choice, or you wanting them to make the choice to do what you want them to do that somehow you could like repair those past hurts.
CLIENT: I'm trying to. Believe me. I'm trying to. My childhood, the more and more I think about it, we it had some good times, but there were a lot of bad times looking back. Just a lot of the lonely feelings. A lot of being picked on. A lot of having to kind of defend myself and it was just very frustrating ","P1-N400551":"because I never really felt that I had the support. I never really felt that I did have any support. [00:22:00]
THERAPIST: Well, you very much feel that your parents weren't able to help you with some really basic, important life skills like being responsible for yourself. You know, managing your impulses at times and sort of very basic, important things. Delaying gratification for the hopes of bettering yourself ","P1-N4005D1":"in the future.
CLIENT: I agree. The more and more I see it in my mother. My mother gets the same way. My mother has the personality where she gets enraged like that and I see that in me. I recognize that I have that trait from her, but I don't want that trait anymore. That's the one trait that I wish I could get rid ","P1-N4005F1":"of is the rage because she, you say a word and it's like a trigger. Boom. She's gone. She gets very red and she starts yelling and screaming and that's how I get. There's a trigger word. I don't know what it is. Boom. You get the feeling in the gut and then I'm enraged and I just start going off.
THERAPIST: Is it the feeling or is the lack of being able to control the feeling? [00:26:00]
CLIENT: Well, it's interesting because I wish I could say I know when it's coming. I don't. When my girlfriend used to drink when I was younger, a couple years ago, I knew every time she drank, I knew it was coming. Now, it's unpredictable. I mean I haven't gotten enraged in months and then last week ","P1-N400631":"it happened again when they mentioned this. I just, I don't know if it was because I was stressed out. If I had a rough weekend or what. I don't know where the rage comes from. When my girlfriend was drinking, I knew that was when it coming because I'd already know it was coming. Once she had a couple ","P1-N400632":"I could see and then I could feel it building. [00:27:00]
THERAPIST: Let's see if we can distinguish it. I think there are two separate things. There is sort of having feeling and then it's not of sort of so neat and clean, but just for our purposes there's having the feeling and then there's how do you express the feeling. So, those two things seem like it's ","P1-N400691":"an important distinction to make. That's why I asked is it the feeling?. Is it having the feeling or is it how you manage the feeling or express it? It sounds like what you're describing is both but an important piece of it is when you have a feeling, it's not inevitable that it comes out nutty. I mean ","P1-N400692":"I'm not saying oh, it's so easy to do things differently, but it's not inevitable that that happens. People have all sorts of strategies of managing how they feel when they're having an intense emotion.
CLIENT: And, that's what I wish I could do. There's certain times where I can be very emotional and I am calm as anything, but it's just certain things. I don't know if it's the time of day or what. Because like I mentioned before, I haven't gotten enraged in a while and then all of a sudden it just ","P1-N4006B1":"came back. I don't know why. I don't know if it was because I was stressed out about work. Trying to find a job. I don't know if it was because I was stressed out about searching for an engagement ring. I don't know. I don't know if it was the anxiety of just in general of being where I want to be. [00:30:30]
THERAPIST: When she reacted that way, did you feel deprived of her support?
CLIENT: I wouldn't say it was deprived. I would say it's disappointed. How I got a job. I haven't worked in almost two years and I finally get a job and my foot's back in the door and this is all you can say? Well, I've heard stories. So? So? I got a job. You should be ecstatic because I am. I look ","P1-N400771":"at it as an opportunity to show my skills and to express who I am and then she comes in and believe me, after I spoke to her it was an all-out voice. I kind of started crying a little bit because I did feel bad yelling at her, telling her how I really felt because I felt like it was inappropriate of ","P1-N400772":"me to do that because I was taught to respect your elders, but I think me doing that made her finally understand that I can't have it. I don't know if it worked completely, if it worked a little bit. I hope it worked it worked a little bit because I need her to start being more positive. [00:36:30]
THERAPIST: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off.
CLIENT: That's alright.
THERAPIST: We're going to need to stop right here.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So, you're hoping to come in next week or the following two weeks?
CLIENT: The following. The 11th.
THERAPIST: Let me take a look. I think the 3:30 will be fine for those.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And, I think that will be fine on going, but I will just need to confirm that.
CLIENT: Okay. You can e-mail me and let me know.
THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah. I'm pretty sure that should be here. Let me just let me check real quick. I don't see why. Yeah, that will be fine. I will let you know about that on going.
CLIENT: Perfect. Thank you very much.
THERAPIST: I'll see you in two weeks.
