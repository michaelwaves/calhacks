DESCRIPTION: Client tries to explain the difference in her low mood emotional states; difference between normal lows and hormonal induced lows.
THERAPIST: Come on in.
CLIENT: So I guess the thing that’s — I did have — I had Karl actually look up about the possible hormone issue from last — last week because I want to say I was afraid that if I was looking — I could tell it was the sort of thing that with what — the state of how ","P1-N4000D1":"I was feeling at the time that it was just going to sort of trigger the same reactions over again. (inaudible at 00:02:59) I looked it up that (inaudible at 00:03:01) looking up was just going to bring me down again. So I asked Karl if he’d check it out and he found that it — basically, ","P1-N4000D2":"there were a lot of women that were talking about it online, (inaudible at 00:03:22). And that definitely made me — and then I could tell, you know, after — the next day I was feeling a bit better and then the day after that I was feeling basically normal again. So yeah, it was obviously, ","P1-N4000D3":"there was something — something hormonal going in there and that was (inaudible at 00:04:00) was sort of triggering that sort of response. [00:04:08]
THERAPIST: What made it painful?
CLIENT: First of all, I just really, really missed Jen. (inaudible at 00:19:44) Jen. She’s — you know, she’s — there are two friends in my life who have meant the most to me, Jen and Lucy. Jen — I think of her, I (inaudible at 00:20:00) it’s funny, I usually have ","P1-N400291":"these ideas, but what comes to mind with Jen is yellow. Golden sunny yellow. When Leah got married, I had this idea, at first it was going to be a Sunday afternoon wedding. I’m not usually all about the clothes for sure. But I — first, it was going to be a Sunday afternoon wedding and I ","P1-N400292":"thought that I had this idea of wearing a nice yellow dress. And then everything (inaudible at 00:20:47) changed, upside down, and then it was going to be an evening wedding, and my mom thought I should get a fancier dress. So I got a fancier dress. I wasn’t so thrilled with having a fancier dress, ","P1-N400293":"but it was nice cause I got a green one and I like green. [00:21:00]
THERAPIST: So that’s called culture emersion school and Anglophones school. I don’t think I’ve ever heard those terms before.
CLIENT: culture emersion is a — sort of technical terms in Mid-West. (laughs)
THERAPIST: I remember you telling me this story. So this was in which school?
CLIENT: (Speaking in French) it was called — it was in grade six in Cleveland.
THERAPIST: So this was the school that your mother taught at?
CLIENT: This was the other one. My mother taught at the (inaudible at 00:27:20) French school, which is a private school. This was public — part of the public school system. Yeah, I thought (inaudible at 00:27:26) be that bad, this one before I was sort of —
THERAPIST: And you moved there for your dad’s job? Or you moved there for you dad’s job?
CLIENT: We moved to Cleveland not for his job. We moved there because — in grade three we went on sabbatical. Then my father, he left his job in Frankfort. He was a professor at the university there. And he left it for a number of reasons (inaudible at 00:27:58) that year, they had been planning ","P1-N400411":"on it already. They wanted to move back to Cleveland because they wanted to — from my perspective in grade six, it was an (inaudible at 00:28:09). But they wanted to move there for our education. [00:28:12]
THERAPIST: Mythical horse with wings.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:41:43). It’s just that sort of — that’s where I was, like, with other kids. And so, I just — and the great thing about back in Cleveland was when I (inaudible at 00:42:20) her, it was sort of like, she read every — she just — there’s ","P1-N400651":"a reason, I think she didn’t go to university because she’d read everything that was in all of the course textbooks. And she just read everything. And my — the way I felt at that point was that that it gave me enough of somebody to hang out with that just let me mark time until — ","P1-N400652":"until I guess I reached the more — it’s (inaudible at 00:43:24) I wanted to go to university. I wanted to go to university, not just because I wanted the courses and the more — you know, being able to write about what I wanted to write and choose my classes. And I wanted to go to university ","P1-N400653":"because you didn’t have lunch hour. You didn’t have recess. You didn’t have a cafeteria where all of the kids go and you have to find a table to sit with other people, I found extremely stressful. [00:43:52]
THERAPIST: Well, you’re doing it now under fire.
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:46:54]
THERAPIST: And in the emersion — the emersion experience of having to do that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Feeling less equipped than you’d like, but defining the issue, which is half the battle and understanding the issue. Making it clear to yourself.
CLIENT: I guess that’s —
CLIENT: Sorry.
THERAPIST: That’s okay. Going to need to actually stop in a moment.
CLIENT: Okay. So, yeah. [00:47:36]
THERAPIST: You were about to say something, though?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it is an —
CLIENT: Hi Karl, can I call you back? Yeah, it’s just that it’s — it’s true. It’s like, it’s sort of a — I guess the thing is that to me it’s a — I think that — what I — it’s like what I just reached right now, where my instinct ","P1-N400831":"was, yes, compromise, that’s what you need to — to — that’s what you didn’t learn. That’s what, you know, you put children on the playground together so that they get more social and they compromise and they learn work together. I had to turn that a little bit, now ","P1-N400832":"I — it’s letting go. Anyway —
THERAPIST: I will see you next week.
CLIENT: Yeah.
