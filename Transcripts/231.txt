TITLE: Client "SJ" Therapy Session Audio Recording, July 25, 2013: Clients discusses a family member who is making their lives difficult because she is rude and ignores them. Client discusses the estranged relationship with her father and her siblings.
DESCRIPTION: Clients discusses a family member who is making their lives difficult because she is rude and ignores them. Client discusses the estranged relationship with her father and her siblings.
THERAPIST: . . . uncomfortable but I haven't met anyone who has said that it's not worked for them, so [ ] (inaudible at 00:00:08).
THERAPIST: So how are you guys doing?
THERAPIST: This seems like such a delicate matter. It's almost like I think about a conversation "should we tell mom that she has cancer?" That's a horrible analogy, in that sense, but it's like what can we do with this very delicate matter? It has that sort of a weight to it.
THERAPIST: How did it become your job to do the car rental?
THERAPIST: There is a reason that she's figuring so prominently in your relationship, I think, above and beyond the practicality of it. There's some meaning about her in your relationship maybe past experiences with your own families and how things are dealt with and it's kind of coming to a head ","P1-N400671":"around her because she seems to represent something that crystallizes everything. [00:23:05]
THERAPIST: What did he do?
THERAPIST: Did your dad treat you worse than your siblings?
THERAPIST: Do you know why?
THERAPIST: So your experience with him is that the only way to be in a relationship with him is to sort of submit to him.
THERAPIST: You're worried that that will be recreated in your relationship with Graham?
THERAPIST: Does Amber's reaction to Candace make you anxious?
THERAPIST: It sounds like jail, "get him out." (chuckles)
THERAPIST: He gets to leave jail once a month on a day pass, but then he has to go back.
THERAPIST: One thing I think about, and this is not true in all families, but when significant others are getting into conflict, I feel like they're expressing something that can't be expressed in the family, that they're somehow recruited, in a way. Recruited is in quotes. They're expressing something ","P1-N400BD1":"that the family is having a hard time managing. I don't know if that's the case in your situation. It's certainly not true across the board. But as I'm listening I'm thinking about that. [00:40:59]
THERAPIST: I'm going to need to leave you guys on this note. I think one way I could really help you is, again, to sort of think about and it sounds like you already have some ideas about this but what Candace represents in your relationship and the compromises that you're worried about that she ","P1-N400C91":"signifies. I feel like if I can help you guys have a conversation about these things with her name not being mentioned not because we can't mention it, but because she's sort of a symbol of something else, I think I can really help you guys work this out. Does that sound good?
THERAPIST: And now, I think I had mentioned to you that I have a couple of Thursdays where I'm going to be away. I'm actually very rarely away, so it happens that I just have a couple of conflicts with that; so I apologize for that. I like to get people on regular schedules. I leave Thursday afternoon ","P1-N400CD1":"for a little over a week, so I am here early next week and then I'm gone the full week after. [00:44:56] But I'm going to extend my Tuesday evening hours next week so that I can accommodate Thursday evening people. I'm happy to do that for you if you if you would like that.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I think I have a 6:00 next Tuesday. Would that work for you?
THERAPIST: Okay. Let's do that. What way are you away in Maine?
THERAPIST: The week after I'm away.
THERAPIST: Okay. How about this I'm going to put you in for the 30th at 6:00. And then it looks like we'll go a couple of weeks and then meet back up again. There is also a Thursday at the end of the month that I'm not going to be here. There are so many Thursdays.
THERAPIST: I apologize. Again, I like to have people have their regular times they can count on.
THERAPIST: Okay. Just let me know as early as you know because these evening hours get booked.
THERAPIST: We'll figure something out. If I get it in e-mail form, it's okay. I'll see you next week on Tuesday at 6:00 and we'll kind of take it from there.
THERAPIST: When it's a small co-pay, you can do it every time or you can do it monthly. Either way is fine with me.
THERAPIST: If you want to do it next time, it doesn't matter.
THERAPIST: Sure. That works out just fine.
THERAPIST: Absolutely. Bye-bye.
