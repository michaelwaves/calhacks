DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the perceptions she has about how people view her and how she hates to see herself in photographs. Client discusses how frustrated she gets by her mother's comments about her and other people.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.
CLIENT: (inaudible) The health insurance so that you'll have because it says that they issued they sent me a check on November 18th for the first one and they never did.
THERAPIST: They never did.
CLIENT: So I don't know if a check date of November 18th means that (inaudible) because that's for the first one. The second one it's like (inaudible) is in there but since they didn't finish that one.
THERAPIST: I see. That's really strange. So when you called and you say they checked and they sent a check to -
CLIENT: No. Well I just called and listened to the they tell you all the different stuff so I didn't talk to anyone but I can ask them again I don't know why.
THERAPIST: Got it. That's really strange.
CLIENT: Well I didn't realize they were supposed to send me the check until (unclear) sent me an e-mail. I don't know.
THERAPIST: Well, I can is your member ID on there do you know? I can have her look into that. Usually they send you a check with an explanation.
CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible).
THERAPIST: Well thank you. Thank you for doing that.
CLIENT: You're welcome.
THERAPIST: We'll figure it out.
CLIENT: So I realized something I think this weekend when I was on New Jersey this weekend and it was for my grandpa's birthday and I was really concerned about seeing people in my family and thinking that they were going to judge me and all this stuff and I was really uncomfortable about it and when ","P1-N400251":"I saw everyone their reaction was more like 'we're really happy to see you and spend time with you. We haven't seen you in so long. It's so great to see you. We're so proud of you and what you're doing in school. It wasn't really what I was expecting and so I think that what I am doing in a lot of different ","P1-N400252":"situations, and I think it's so think it's because of stuff that's happened to me in the past, but I think I'm manifesting things about myself onto other people.
THERAPIST: I think that's such an important insight.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Really, such an important insight.
CLIENT: Because and I don't know how to stop thinking that way (crying) about myself because normally I won't look at pictures of myself and I don't let people take pictures of me but I kind of like they were taking group photos and I couldn't really run away so and then I didn't want to open the ","P1-N400311":"pictures and look at them but I wanted to see the pictures of everybody else and I also wanted to force myself to look at the pictures because I felt like I needed to look at them like I couldn't avoid it but when I did look at them I didn't I saw good stuff when I looked at everybody else but I didn't ","P1-N400312":"see anything good when I looked at myself. And the same thing happened when I was at my friend's wedding in October I thought I looked great and I was having a fun time and then someone took a photo and then showed it and said, 'oh, that's a good photo.' And I saw what I looked like in the picture and ","P1-N400313":"it ruined my entire night because then I was like I look so awful and I can't believe that I didn't realize that I looked like this and then my friend a couple of weeks ago sent those pictures from the wedding around and I was like I ruined all of her pictures because I looked so disgusting and so horrible. ","P1-N400314":"So seeing like in the moment I might not feel badly about myself, it's when I see pictures of myself that I think that the picture the way that I see myself in the picture is the way I really must look to everyone else and the way I see myself in person when I think I look okay, that's not what I ","P1-N400315":"really look like. That's me. I feel like that's me somehow like distorting myself to look better. And then when I see myself in pictures, I think about how fat I look and how terrible I look and then I think that that view is what everybody else sees. So it's weird though because it's not necessarily ","P1-N400316":"happening in person if I'm getting ready or something. I may actually think I look okay. I might actually have confidence and then it's when I see a picture and I think I look so bad and I say, 'that's what I must really look like,' and I wonder why I thought that I looked okay. [00:08:20]
THERAPIST: What do you think it is about a picture in particular?
CLIENT: To me the picture captures the reality of how I look from like every angle and to me a picture is like someone else capturing how they see you and so I feel like the picture is how everybody else sees that's how everybody else sees me, maybe not how I see myself but that's how everybody else ","P1-N400351":"must see me because it's like a picture of like someone looking at you. And when I look in the mirror I think I look okay and when I'm looking at like a certain angle and maybe I don't look good from every angle or something but I can't stand to see pictures of myself and I try to not let people take ","P1-N400352":"pictures of me and then sometimes and this is only in the past couple of years since I gained weight, it wasn't like that before that but and then I think like also because so many people take it from different angles in relation to me and it shows like all these different all the different flaws ","P1-N400353":"I have from all the different vantage points so I guess to me the picture is more I think it's more realistic than what I see and I don't know why but it literally when I see a picture I always think, 'oh that's what the person must have thought of me and I thought I looked good then, but I didn't. ","P1-N400354":"This is what I really looked like and this is what they must have been thinking when they were talking with me. And it's only when I see pictures from an event or something that I look back and think, 'oh they really must have been thinking about how fat I was because I look really fat in this picture.'
THERAPIST: It's like when literally the lens is turned outward in.
CLIENT: Yeah. But to me it's almost like the camera lens I'm looking through is how other people must see me because it's like another set of eyes other than my own capturing me and that's how everybody must see me. Because when I look at other people in a picture I'm like, 'oh, that's what they look ","P1-N4003D1":"like.' So I just feel like, I almost feel like I have a distortedly, I think of myself too positively when I'm looking in the mirror and the camera is what's real. But I really thought it's only when I see these pictures that's when I start thinking that this other person must be thinking all these ","P1-N4003D2":"things about me. So it's not in the moment and it's not related to interaction with another person, it's everything that I'm finding I'm putting it onto the other people in deciding that. That's what I'm thinking. But I know why I can't avoid having people take pictures of me and I can try to avoid ","P1-N4003D3":"seeing them but it's really hard to when people send you something or whatever. And I don't want to avoid either thing. I mean, because I was looking back over the past couple of years and I don't have a lot of pictures that I'm in at events or different things because I was taking them and didn't want ","P1-N4003D4":"to be in them so it's kind of a shame to me that I don't have these pictures of these memories because I'm avoiding being in them and it's like I don't want to avoid life or these different things because of the way that I see myself.
THERAPIST: It sounds like one of the things that you're describing is really a kind of confusion about what's inside and what's outside and what you feel and what other people feel.
CLIENT: Yeah. Because I know that it's really I know that when I'm picking apart the photos that it's me talking and that it's what I'm feeling. But I don't understand why I'm not why it's only (unclear) when I'm looking at myself in photos because I think that. It seems almost like I'm escaping ","P1-N400411":"from saying that I could feel this way so that I'm putting it on other people because I don't want to acknowledge that I feel this way about myself so I'm thinking I'm trying to say that's what everybody else thinks but it's definitely how I feel. I just don't understand why it's like one minute I could ","P1-N400412":"just look in the mirror and say, 'okay, that's fine.' And then when I see a picture it's like I'm picking everything apart.
THERAPIST: Do you think it's also part of it that it sorts of exists in real time? It's not a perception it's an actual object, the picture.
CLIENT: Like, you mean that I have a snap of it and I haven't had time to pick it apart or that -
THERAPIST: Maybe it's like when you look at yourself in the mirror that you just have that moment whereas you have a picture it's sort of, it's branded in a sense it's there.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: An object in itself.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I can go back to it and see the different things because like the pictures from this weekend once I clicked on one and saw -I thought it was really bad, then I clicked on other ones to say was it bad every time? Yep, it was. I see all these things in every single one and so it gave ","P1-N4004D1":"me something to sort of like evaluate or be able to take the time to really look at and then I'm like immediately when I see this stuff I think, 'what can I do?' Can I start drinking Slim-Fast immediately? Immediately my mind goes to, I need a quick fix because I can't see myself like this anymore. ","P1-N4004D2":"Like I can't go through seeing pictures like this again and again and again.
THERAPIST: There's something that feels intolerable?
CLIENT: Yeah, because after seeing the pictures from the wedding that were sent around I just thought, 'this is so terrible. I can't even look at putting myself out there in public like this.' And then it's sort of like died down and then it happened again with these pictures and I thought, 'I can't ","P1-N400511":"look like this anymore and I can't do this and I need to find a solution that's immediate so I don't have to look like this anymore.' And then it will go away but then it could happen again. So it's sort of like yeah, like I can't deal with looking at these pictures and knowing that I'm out there ","P1-N400512":"in the world looking like this. [00:20:20]
THERAPIST: I started to think about your mom and started to think that there must have been something probably still is something inside of her that she felt so unsettling, or ugly or disturbing that she sort of grafted onto her appearance and also onto your appearance by seeing you guys as almost as ","P1-N400551":"twins. It's something like that you are now trying to deal with inside of you and it gets sort of played out on the canvas of your body in your appearance.
CLIENT: Yeah, well she always talks about she always will tell me about issues with her weight and go yo-yo dieting and all kinds of stuff but then this weekend when we were with my aunts she was like, well, those two look so great because they're always working out every time I talk to them they're ","P1-N400571":"working out. I don't have time like, she's still, I think, still feeling all that stuff and that's just part of her running commentary of justifying well they look like this and I don't think I look as good as my sisters because of the so that's definitely all there and she probably feels a lot ","P1-N400572":"of the same things which I think is because of the way I grew up that I feel those things too, but I mean she's always saying, she'll say, 'I looked at this picture and everyone else looks rested and great and I look like the tired -' like she says like that a lot. So I mean I think it's similar. And ","P1-N400573":"there's a lot of like jealousy of other people and she says, well I do all this stuff and so that's why I don't look there's all kinds of stuff. So I mean that's definitely part of it because she definitely says (unclear) about my appearance. Like I know with her it's not really me manifesting it ","P1-N400574":"but that's real and she definitely talks about other people's appearance, too, and so I think a lot of it, too, is that well everybody else must be like her and they must go home and have these commentaries about how everybody looks and all this stuff. And so because she does that and that's how I grew ","P1-N400575":"up, sometimes I think part of me putting all this stuff in other people's heads or thinking this is what they were thinking is because when we would come home from something, that's what my mom would do and so I just think that automatically that's what everybody else does and that everybody's always ","P1-N400576":"going to be critical of you and talking about you but that's I know that that's not the case and I know that people could have gone home and said, 'oh we're really glad we got to see Felicity and we're really happy that we got to spend time with them.' And probably they might not have said anything ","P1-N400577":"about my weight but I decided that instead of saying that it was great to see me they said and did you see how fat she got, she must have been avoiding us because she got so fat. So to me that's what they were saying. Because that's what my mom would do when we would get home from a party or something. ","P1-N400578":"She would say, look how many less (unclear) this person has. She gained a lot of weight. It's probably because she likes her drinks, or something like there's all kinds of comments made about other people.
THERAPIST: Is there bitterness to her comments?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It sounds like it. Bitterness.
CLIENT: Yeah, and that's I mean, I think that's what bothers me the most because I try really hard to un-train myself from seeing all that stuff in other people and to being more like envious of other people and trying to put them down because I'm envious because I think that's what my mom always did. ","P1-N4005F1":"And I don't want to say these negative things and I don't want to think of others in that way but it's really hard to retrain your brain when you grew up with that's just like normal conversation. But I think that the reason she would say that stuff about other people is because she felt stressed out ","P1-N4005F2":"and that she was giving a lot and the other people weren't and she was sort of envious of them.
THERAPIST: Yeah, that sounds like a lot of voices to undo.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well that's I mean I think that's the hardest thing now that I I mean I think it's good that I realize that it's me and probably not the other people, but that being said, it's hard to not think to stop the behavior of thinking all of these things because literally that's when ","P1-N400651":"I look at these pictures that's what I see and the immediate thing that pops into my head is not that I'm thinking these things about myself, it's just that that's what everybody else sees. Like that's just it seems like a natural mechanism. I see the picture. I look terrible. That's what everybody ","P1-N400652":"else saw. It's even if I know it's me thinking all of this.
THERAPIST: Did your mother's comments ever make you angry?
CLIENT: About other people? They do now. They I used to just play into it and say, 'oh really?' and like because I didn't know any better. To me it was normal conversation to have about other people and if anything, I was doing the same thing. Because that to me was just normal and it probably really ","P1-N400691":"wasn't until I met my boyfriend and he would say, 'hey, why are you saying this stuff about -?' that I realized first of all what I was doing and that I realized where it was coming from and now I'm to a point where it makes me very angry and for the past year or two I'm (unclear) 'can't you just focus ","P1-N400692":"on the positive?' Can't you but it doesn't work so I think being aware of what's going on has caused me to become angry about the way that she speaks. So that's why I like a lot of the stuff she does now just makes me so mad and it's really hard. Like I feel like the only way to interact with her ","P1-N400693":"is to just go along with what she wants because if I let her know that I don't like the way she's being or if I say something, she literally flips out and yells and goes crazy.
THERAPIST: You're describing two things. One is sort of a projection of your own feelings that you've taken in over a long time onto other people and the other like very understandably is a kind of paranoia which was very much inculcated into you like with reason to be paranoid.
CLIENT: Yeah, there is huge paranoia. There's so much stress that goes with that paranoia like thinking about how other people are perceiving you all the time is really, really stressful and so and I think that I have made progress with that like just being able to casually like go in front of people ","P1-N400731":"and talk and different things is big for me because normally I would be so worried about what everybody was thinking so in certain scenarios and certain situations I think I am getting better. Like it's not happening as often but in other situations or especially with the pictures it can get really, ","P1-N400732":"really bad and then it takes away from enjoying whatever you're doing. Like the whole wedding thing. I was really having fun at this wedding and it literally, seeing this picture, just ruined my entire night and I just had to leave because I couldn't have fun anymore because I thought to myself this ","P1-N400733":"is what I look like. And I cannot be walking around like this anymore. Like I have to leave. So it's so stressful and so horrible that I can ruin a whole lot of different situations for me both being paranoid about what the other people think and also just feeling so disgusted with myself as this ","P1-N400734":"really it's a feeling of disgust. Like I can't even see anything positive.
THERAPIST: Do you feel that that's how that you mother felt that way toward you?
CLIENT: I feel like her feelings towards me were more that she wanted me to be better than what she thought she was. And so I think when she saw me and really I get so mad because looking back I really was never overweight as a kid or teenager it makes me really mad that she thought I was because ","P1-N400771":"like scientifically, medically, I wasn't. It makes me really angry. But when she would say that I was gaining weight or that I was overweight and then tell me stories about her weight problems as a teenager, I think in her mind it was more like I don't want you to go through what I went through so I'm ","P1-N400772":"going to help you do all these things so you don't go through that so you're a better version or better than what I was and you don't have to go through all that. So I think I feel that was and is her intention but by doing the things she did and continues to do she's made it worse. So I think when ","P1-N400773":"she sees me she sees me having similar struggles to what she went through and she doesn't want me to have those so she's trying to say and do all of these things to help but it's making the situation worse. So I'm not sure that she looks at me and just I don't think that she looks at me the same way ","P1-N400774":"that I look at myself but I think she feels like she needs to help me because she doesn't want me to have all these issues. And then she told me also this weekend that she looked at all of the photos of me from when I was 19 until now and she thinks that the reason I have gained so much weight is because ","P1-N400775":"of birth control. So knowing that she is looking at pictures of me and analyzing me from when I was 19 until now is just really not a great feeling to know. I mean I do enough of that to myself so it's not really a good feeling to know that someone is looking back on photos of you and trying to say ","P1-N400776":"like, where did she go wrong?' And how could she have gained all this weight and what did she do?
THERAPIST: Birth control. And then she comes up with birth control.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Is there a meaning behind that or do you feel that there is some meaning?
CLIENT: Well I went on birth control when I was like 17 but she found out about it when I was 19.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: So maybe that was so horrific to her because she's very religious that she remembered that and she's blaming everything on that. That's my only thought. Because I do remember that she found it or something like that and went crazy. So that may be so traumatic in her mind that she may have associated ","P1-N400831":"it with that but the fact that she's trying to go back and figure out where I went wrong I do enough of that to myself.
THERAPIST: She's obsessed. She's obsessed.
CLIENT: Yeah and she doesn't do that stuff to my sister at all. And my sister is pretty thin but isn't as thin as she was when she was 19 either. And so she's not doing that to her. She not going through her pictures and trying to figure it out and so and she just said it like at random like she ","P1-N400871":"says stuff randomly. So she was showing me photo albums that she made for my grandfather and that's what she said.
THERAPIST: So there's no prelude. It's just something that's on her mind somehow.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Felicity, we're going to need to stop for today. So the next two Wednesdays are Christmas and New Year's.
CLIENT: Oh yeah.
THERAPIST: I'm going to be here other days so if you wanted to find another time to meet I'd be happy to do so.
CLIENT: Christmas week we're going to be in Pennsylvania but the week after it might be (unclear).
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Another time. I actually have I'm training at work. I have my schedule for that week, too. So I could e-mail you with what works for me that week.
THERAPIST: And then I put in the schedule where you discussed starting in January.
CLIENT: Starting like the first week, the first full week in January.
THERAPIST: Okay, great.
CLIENT: Okay. Thank you.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: Yeah, let me know if you need me to do anything else with the insurance.
THERAPIST: I'll have -
CLIENT: I should have like that has like what they're going to reimburse.
THERAPIST: Usually that comes with the check. That rarely comes by itself.
CLIENT: Well no this is from online. It didn't come in the mail. I went online and printed it out.
THERAPIST: It says the 18th. That means they should have sent it out. The check date is the 18th. Would you mind calling them? I could have your (unclear) -
CLIENT: Okay and just say where.
THERAPIST: That you never got it. Yeah. Thank you so much.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Okay. Good-bye.
