DESCRIPTION: Clients discuss their extreme trust issues when they are hanging out with members of the opposite sex without each other present. Clients' trust issues stem from previous indiscretions.
THERAPIST: Hi!
MALE CLIENT: Hi.
THERAPIST: How are you guys doing?
FEMALE CLIENT: Bad week.
THERAPIST: Bad week? What's been going on?
FEMALE CLIENT: I guess I can just go in chronological order.
THERAPIST: Sure.
FEMALE CLIENT: Some are worse than others. (pause) So I guess the first thing I was at work one night and I got a text from him that said his friend Scott was in our area and that we should go see him because he was in our area. So I get home and he's getting ready and I asked if that guy's name ","P1-N4001B1":"is Scott I asked if his girlfriend was there (pause) and he said no. So I said, "Okay, I'll just stay home. I don't really want to hang out with you and your guy friend. No big deal." So he says, "Fine." And then while he's out I'm thinking why is Scott just by himself at a bar right next to our house? ","P1-N4001B2":"It's a little odd. So I asked him when he got back and he said, "Yeah, he was just there by himself." So long story short it turns out that he (pause) actually made plans with Peter to meet up. That's why he was at the bar. So it wasn't just that Scott was in the north end and we should go see him. ","P1-N4001B3":"He had to go see him already. He made those plans and the text was just misleading me to believe that he was around coincidentally so we should go see him so he had to go. [00:01:47]
THERAPIST: Sure. [00:02:31]
FEMALE CLIENT: (pause) Then he told me a few days ago that he went swimming at this pond near his parent's house (pause) which is normal so that ended that conversation. And then a few days later he says out of the blue, "So just in case it comes up that day that I went swimming..." this girl receptionist ","P1-N400211":"at his hair salon went with him. (pause) So I was completely caught off guard and was just in shock that he wouldn't tell me something like that beforehand. And I don't know this girl. I've never heard her name. I didn't know she existed, never seen her, didn't know they text each other back and forth ","P1-N400212":"and this is how they met up. [00:03:25]
THERAPIST: (pause) So it feels for you at least Melanie that something is breaking down between the two of you.
FEMALE CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Are you feeling the same way about it Peter?
MALE CLIENT: Something is definitely breaking down. I don't know that that outline of the story is the sign of it but it's been breaking down before that. This is kind of a new issue that has come up. We haven't really had an issue like the trust thing before or at least she hasn't. (pause) But I don't ","P1-N400311":"see it exactly the same way, or even close, to the way that she sees it. But I don't know where we're going in this session if I should sit and tell my side of the story or where do you think we should go here?
THERAPIST: Wherever...however...I want to sort of just see what unfolds and I'm usually most helpful that way so whatever you want to...if you want to address what Melanie is saying or talk more about what you feel is breaking down. [00:09:18]
MALE CLIENT: I think I'll address what she just said but I think that the bigger issue is (pause) the last part of it. I mean (pause) the one that she just streamed over in the end is that (pause) what she did...she has a history and she knows that I want to know where she is. There's a big reason for ","P1-N400351":"it that came up recently. She tends to make friends with guys much quicker than women and she tends to like to hang out with guys. It's...the reason I asked who she was with was that the last time that she went out with guys from work she works at a restaurant so she went out with a few waiters ","P1-N400352":"and hung out and (pause) on her way home, it's a long story, but on her way home this guy who she just met up with five minutes before the night was over walked her down the street to the house and then outside the window tried to make out with her (pause) which she obviously didn't let him make out ","P1-N400353":"but it wasn't like a shocking slap in the face or "Go away" or whatever. It was like, "Oh you're drunk. Go home." [00:10:49]
FEMALE CLIENT: Once (pause) before this continues I hung out with them once. I haven't hung out with guys in two months since I don't know anyone here. (inaudible)
MALE CLIENT: Two guys from work? (chuckle) Okay.
FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible) casually hang out with guys and that's why you didn't tell me because you casually hang out with girls like it's okay. Like, it's been once. In two months, it's been once. [00:14:45]
MALE CLIENT: Okay, so the guy that tried to make out with you in front of our house you only hung out with five minutes that night because you walked him to the corner.
FEMALE CLIENT: Right.
MALE CLIENT: That was the only time you ever hung out with him?
FEMALE CLIENT: (pause) With...are you talking about Dwayne and that night that I was with your friends and him?
MALE CLIENT: Right, so she's classifying hanging out with my friends and him as she was walking out of a restaurant going to the cigar room with him and my friends just happened to appear on the street.
FEMALE CLIENT: That's not true. That's not true. Why do you keep changing the story?
MALE CLIENT: Okay did I interrupt you when I was talking?
FEMALE CLIENT: You're just lying.
MALE CLIENT: Right. (pause) It's not even...it's also a history of that she always hangs out with guys anyways. What's new? All of her friends from up there...a lot of her friends from Montana...she's from Helena. She has friends that she goes and hangs out with up there, friends in law school. I don't ","P1-N400531":"have a problem with it. I mean, I do, she knows that I do, but it's something that I'm willing to kind of adjust and accept. (pause) But I lost trust with the types of guys not to stereotype but the people that are waiting at a restaurant, I just don't (pause) like their motives. I don't know if... [00:16:06]
THERAPIST: Has this been an issue throughout your relationship, at least from your end?
MALE CLIENT: A little, a little bit. It's not a huge issue. It is something that just pecks every few months or something. It arises. It's not always there. It's not (pause) a huge reason for breakdown. The breakdown is the way that we handle things.
THERAPIST: Yeah one thing that I was thinking is issues of trust come on when people don't feel like they have...they're secure in their relationship. When people feel secure in their relationship (pause) typically these are not concerns. So clearly I would imagine both of you are feeling that way.
FEMALE CLIENT: Well issues of trust came up because he lied to me and mislead me this week. I don't have trust issues with him. I have girlfriends who go through their boyfriends' phone, hack into their Facebook, read their e-mails. I would never want to be like that. I would never want to not trust ","P1-N4005D1":"him. I don't want to doubt him when he tells me something. I don't want to be that girl that feels like I need to sneak into his phone when he's not looking and (pause) after this week's events I'm just angry because I don't want to look through his phone but that's how I feel right now. I feel like ","P1-N4005D2":"I don't trust him. Whatever he tells me could be a lie. I don't know what else he's lied about. Like my mind is going to a million different places that I don't ever want it going to and I always said I'm not going to be with someone if I don't trust them. It's just a waste and I don't not trust him ","P1-N4005D3":"because our relationship is breaking down. I don't trust him because of specific events that happened. As much as he wants to talk about me having guy friends, yeah I have an equal amount of male friends and female friends, both from law school in Maine and back home. When I go home I hang out with ","P1-N4005D4":"my next door neighbor who's a guy a lot. We grew up together but the majority of my time is spent with my close girlfriends. I'm very close to my girlfriends back home. [00:19:24]
MALE CLIENT: I don't understand why you say that. It hasn't happened once.
FEMALE CLIENT: What are you talking about?
MALE CLIENT: You hang out with guy friends. You've done it the whole time we've been together.
FEMALE CLIENT: We're talking about New Haven, since we've been here and I have zero friends here!
MALE CLIENT: Why are we talking about New Haven? Why would that be zeroed in? I don't understand. We've lived here two months.
FEMALE CLIENT: Right, and in the past two months I've gone out once with guys and it's only because I work with all guys! (chuckle)
MALE CLIENT: We're talking about the last two years.
FEMALE CLIENT: Okay so when are all the times I go out with guys? Who...what guys? My best friends are Miranda, Kelly, and Penelope. Will? Bernie? Guys that I hang out with...you know them! It's like you can't compare that to you lying to me about hanging out with a girl that I don't know. I've never ","P1-N400711":"heard of before. You're texting her behind my back. That's completely different than him knowing who my friends are and that I'm out with them. [00:20:45]
MALE CLIENT: It's not any different from the guy you hung out with at the restaurant, the two or three guys you hung out with at the restaurant. I didn't know them. I've never met them before.
FEMALE CLIENT: Right but what did I do? I sent you a text and said they're going out.
MALE CLIENT: ...until he's trying to make out with you outside our house.
FEMALE CLIENT: Right, that's obviously all my fault. He wants to blame me for that. But what did I do the night that I went out with those guys? Did I not text you saying, "These guys are going out tonight. Do you mind if I go with them?" (pause) I gave you the decency (pause) to tell you where I was. ","P1-N400791":"I told you exactly which bar I was going to.
MALE CLIENT: You're right and I said that. And that's great but you don't actually care if I'm comfortable with it. You just...
FEMALE CLIENT: Right because had you said no I obviously wouldn't have gone.
MALE CLIENT: ...check your luck.
THERAPIST: Do you not feel that's true?
MALE CLIENT: What's that?
THERAPIST: Melanie is saying that she wants you to be comfortable with it and that's sort of what would dictate. Do you not feel that's true?
MALE CLIENT: Not at all. I feel that she does it (pause) to basically inform me but if I'm not comfortable and I say no it's going to be very awkward and a big deal. I would just...I have to just put up with it. [00:21:53]
FEMALE CLIENT: Well it's going to bother me if he says no. I think that's normal. But I still, had he said no to me, I wouldn't have gone out to spite him. I would have gone home and I would have been upset, naturally, (pause) but that doesn't mean I don't care about whether he's comfortable with it ","P1-N4008B1":"or not. There are plenty of things I have not done because he's not comfortable with them. (pause) I haven't seen or spoken to the guy at work who tried to make out with me that night and I would never, ever, go out with him again, which I'm sure (pause) Peter would not give me the benefit of the doubt ","P1-N4008B2":"of and probably thought I was maybe with him the other night and that's why he was upset when I didn't tell him who I was with.
MALE CLIENT: That's not even...I don't know why you would even think that.
FEMALE CLIENT: Well because you brought it up when you said I wouldn't tell you the names of the people I was with.
MALE CLIENT: I didn't think you were with him. I just figured you were with some other guy at work.
FEMALE CLIENT: So why do you want to know their names? [00:22:45]
MALE CLIENT: Because I'm... (pause)...I always want to know...I have an issue with security at work as a private detective. When I was in the military I was in the Rangers in the army and I always liked to (pause) make sure first. There are issues of trust, things like that, there's jealousy. I'm not ","P1-N400951":"saying none of those are an issue but I always want to make sure that she's safe and that other day there is a sign that this guy that she walked home with is extremely sketchy. (pause)
FEMALE CLIENT: Oh my God. Are you fucking serious?
MALE CLIENT: ...anyway (pause) and this guys is just, he prides himself on being (pause) like a Spanish gangster type of person. And she, up until when I saw that happening which another issue is that she never would have told me about it had I not have seen it this guy was like her...the coolest ","P1-N4009B1":"guy at work that she could hang out with and talk to, that she related to the most. And (pause) he goes to the cigar bar next door every night so I don't know, you said it's been once so she's hung out with him one time after this...before this night. But it's the only guy that has been described to ","P1-N4009B2":"me as somebody who she likes at work. [00:25:08]
FEMALE CLIENT: That's not true. (pause) Sergio the Serbian kid on the block (ph) guy.
MALE CLIENT: Okay, but this is my perspective.
FEMALE CLIENT: But you're lying! It's not true!
MALE CLIENT: I'm not lying. It's just those...whatever the impression that I got from your description of those people, that was really like blurb, blurb, and this was like paragraphs of a description.
FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So are you concerned that Melanie is putting herself in situations where she's not safe or are you concerned that Melanie wants to cheat on you?
MALE CLIENT: I don't think she wants to cheat on me. I just think that she (pause) puts herself in situations where she's in control of exactly how that... (pause) The motive isn't to cheat. It's just the questionable circumstances. Why does she need that? I don't know if it's the male attention or ","P1-N400A91":"if it's just she (pause) needs to be able to...she relates better to guys in certain circumstances. I don't know. [00:26:20]
FEMALE CLIENT: I can solve that puzzle for you. It's because I moved to New Haven to be with Peter. I know zero people here. It's miserable and I am dying for someone to hang out with me after work or just have a drink, do something, anything, and he was the waiter that trained me so he was the person ","P1-N400AB1":"I had the most interaction with my first week at work. So naturally when (chuckle) I'm starting to make friends at work, he's the first person that offers. We can go out for a drink or we can hang out and he knows about my boyfriend. Everyone at my work does. There are no female waitresses there.
MALE CLIENT: See this one quick thing is that (pause) right there. It's neither here nor there. "He knows about my boyfriend." (pause) I've described the guy. I don't know how far I need to go into detail. I know that he doesn't give a shit that she has a boyfriend.
FEMALE CLIENT: Right, we know that now because he tried to make out with me. [00:27:14]
MALE CLIENT: Right. (pause) I'm pretty sure that would have been my assessment from the beginning. What I wonder is why doesn't she get that from people? This guy is a scumbag. Why doesn't she realize that?
FEMALE CLIENT: Because like he said...
MALE CLIENT: Or does she not want to...
FEMALE CLIENT: ...I can be in control of a situation if I want to. If he does come on to me like he did, I push him away and tell him to go home. Then Peter opened the door and I walked inside. To me (pause) yeah it sucks that he did that and he's a jerk for trying but it's not going to be the end of ","P1-N400B71":"the world for me. I've been hit on by guys enough that it doesn't faze me as much anymore. And if I am in control of the situation and I just want to go out and have someone to hang out with...I didn't even spend a night with him. He was at a bar on the corner of my street so when I was walking home ","P1-N400B72":"from hanging out with the other two guys, he offered to walk me home. I spoke to him for five minutes and he walked me home. (pause) I wasn't even spending time with him. He wasn't like this one person that totally tricked me and he was the closest person I got to at the restaurant. He was just the ","P1-N400B73":"person I spent the most time with. So I have his cell phone number and he told me he was around the corner so I met up with him. [00:28:25]
THERAPIST: So let me ask you, I mean in this way, you guys have very different feelings about the situation. Do you feel for each of you do you feel that you understand why the other person is thinking that? Not that you have to agree with it but do you understand why they got to the conclusion ","P1-N400BB1":"they did or do you just think this is nuts?
MALE CLIENT: I don't think she understands why I go to my conclusion (ph).
FEMALE CLIENT: See he can't answer for himself. He has to already judge what I'm going to say and think the most negative thing possible and then answer for me because I would have said, "Yes, I understand how he gets to that conclusion." [00:29:21]
MALE CLIENT: So how do I get to it?
FEMALE CLIENT: But that doesn't scream doubt to you? Like there's no faith. There's no trust whatsoever. (pause) I have to prove it to you!
MALE CLIENT: Through our conversations is what I'm basing it off so why don't you just go ahead and answer me?
FEMALE CLIENT: That's frustrating to me. I don't want to have to prove myself. (crying) I want him to take what I'm saying and just believe me and there's...I don't even do the same thing he does. I don't even lie to him! There's no reason why he should have zero faith in me. He hasn't even answered ","P1-N400C91":"why he's lied about hanging out with that girl. He skips over everything he does. There's no fault in anything, ever. (pause) I don't feel the need to prove anything to him right now. I'm still extremely upset and hurt about what happened and he hasn't taken any ownership for it. He just sees me dwelling ","P1-N400C92":"on something and that I should get over it. [00:30:21]
THERAPIST: Have you asked him?
FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, he just doesn't want me to dwell on it. He said sorry already.
MALE CLIENT: That's not true at all. I did, I apologized for it. I said I should have let her know ahead of time. I (pause) took complete ownership for it and I never (pause)...that's not even the issue right...that's not (pause)...that was the day before and then you went and you did your revenge scheme afterward.
FEMALE CLIENT: Right, so we should just focus on the revenge thing.
MALE CLIENT: No, I mean, we took care of it. I said I'm sorry. I said I would not do that again. I would make sure that I let you know and then I realized the importance of it to you and then the next day there was another issue that we need to talk... [00:31:26]
FEMALE CLIENT: But that's not the end of it for me. You can't just say sorry and then if I don't get over it I'm dwelling on it. It doesn't work that way! I'm not over it!
MALE CLIENT: Alright so, how many more times are you going to do a revenge scheme and then we'll get to talk more about how sorry I am? I don't understand at all what you're trying to do.
THERAPIST: Did you think...did you not tell her because you were worried she wouldn't approve?
MALE CLIENT: She was at work. When I text her at work it's not like...she's usually extremely busy so it's not like I planned to go swimming for the day with her. This isn't like you go to the beach and put down a picnic, stuff like that. This was on my way to my mom's house. I go to this pond. It's ","P1-N400E11":"where I swim laps, like a half mile back and forth. And she texted saying, "Are you coming into Cheshire?" And the reason she texts is she's a receptionist at my hair salon. The hair salon woman that owns it is coming into the law firm that I work at. She's going through a divorce so she's going to ","P1-N400E12":"come in and we're going to represent her. So this woman, she will usually make my appointments via her text on her cell phone and then tell the hair salon owner, "This is when Peter is coming in." [00:32:46]
FEMALE CLIENT: And didn't tell me when you said you went swimming, just implied that you went by yourself, lie about it again?
MALE CLIENT: (pause) You just throw that out there. First of all...
FEMALE CLIENT: Well why did you do that that time? I wasn't at work. I was sitting staring at you. (pause) You said, "I went swimming today at the pond," and didn't say who you were with. Why would you do that?
MALE CLIENT: Yeah I...because it was...you two were having a conversation and I said I was going swimming. The conversation went to something else and then I would have had to bring up, "Oh by the way, I was going swimming with that girl." [00:34:52]
FEMALE CLIENT: Does that sound believable to anyone? Are you serious?
MALE CLIENT: It is believable.
FEMALE CLIENT: You said, "I went swimming at the pond." You didn't finish the sentence by saying "with someone else."
MALE CLIENT: Right.
FEMALE CLIENT: The conversation changed so you couldn't tell me anymore?
MALE CLIENT: This is how we get to these places where somebody apologizes. I didn't do it, I should have, and it just seemed like an awkward thing to bring up at that time and I didn't realize the importance of it and I did want to make sure that she knew. There was no reason...I didn't need to tell ","P1-N400F91":"her at all. She would have never found out that I went swimming with someone. I did it because I wanted her to know. In reality my intention was to tell her that night but it just didn't (pause) come out. It was awkward to bring up.
THERAPIST: Well here's the basic problem that (pause) is probably obvious but I'll say it anyway. Neither of you are buying each other's story.
FEMALE CLIENT: (chuckle)
THERAPIST: I mean you're not buying (chuckle) each other's story. And I'm not sure how to help you resolve it but certainly that's a pretty core issue and it's not clear how you guys will get on the same page because evidence or trying to explain your point of view doesn't facilitate the other person ","P1-N400FF1":"(chuckle) buying the story. It seems like a justification that makes the story fall apart even more. And (pause) I'm not really sure what's going on to the point, with you guys, to the point that you're like, "I'm not buying this at all." [00:36:18]
FEMALE CLIENT: Well now I just don't...
MALE CLIENT: It's true.
FEMALE CLIENT: I just...it's getting worse and worse.
MALE CLIENT: It's somewhat in the way that we handle and cope with things, it doesn't mesh. I would say (pause) since the beginning a lot of the way that she handles and copes with things, I sometimes don't buy it. It's true, I don't. It is a core issue. (pause) Because I feel like sometimes it's a ","P1-N401071":"masquerade, there's a diversion, things like that. (pause) When that happens I tend to do and revert to the... (pause) maybe the tactics from growing up that I had learned... (pause) Whenever we had an issue or get in trouble as kids I had three siblings...two siblings including me we'd get in trouble ","P1-N401072":"and we'd have all these elaborate stories about why we weren't guilty and my dad would just sit and listen and he wouldn't even buy any of it. He would just at the end have already known what we did, somehow. [00:37:38]
THERAPIST: Well one thing...well I have a couple thoughts. One, sort of an odd way of putting it, and I don't think you guys are there yet because you're both very distressed, but I guess on one level maybe you guys can empathize...you're having the same experience. You're not feeling like you can trust ","P1-N4010D1":"the other person and you know how bad that feels and that's how the other person is feeling. (pause) You can sort of say the evidence doesn't bare it out and obviously each of you are entitled to your perspective but the other person is feeling just the way (chuckle) you're feeling which is, "I can't ","P1-N4010D2":"feel safe with this person. I don't know what's true and not true." And being in that position is pretty crazy-making, when the person that you love and rely on the most, you can't even sort out what's happening. It's a very crazy-making position to be in. And it seems like right now both of you are ","P1-N4010D3":"in that position. It sounds like for you Peter this has been a lot more long term issue whereas it seems like for you Melanie this is sort of a new element to the relationship that's feeling very unsettling. [00:40:47]
FEMALE CLIENT: Well I've just recently (pause) found him in several lies this week so yeah, it's (crying) gotten worse.
MALE CLIENT: This is also frustrating, it's this...
FEMALE CLIENT: We shouldn't call it a lie right?
MALE CLIENT: ...she throws out like I've been lying...the thing with Scott, it was something spawned from a good intention where I know that after work she wants to hang out and she doesn't have a lot of friends that she knows in New Haven so I got out of work much later than I thought an I made a plan ","P1-N401151":"with Bernie I wanted to do earlier. It was something I kind of...it was a flexible plan that I made three days earlier but I haven't seen him in a long time and he helped us move all of our stuff into our house. I felt bad because I made a kind of tentative plan for that day which I would have liked ","P1-N401152":"to have done from 9pm to midnight and then when she got out I would be home. But instead it went from...it started at around the time she got out, 11:30 or something like that, midnight and so that's when I actually got around to being able to meet him and so there was a fighting match on TV down the ","P1-N401153":"street. Bernie 's like, "Okay, why don't we go there," so we made a plan to meet up there. [00:42:10]
FEMALE CLIENT: Might be more...of a lie?
MALE CLIENT: More criminal or whatever.
FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, but was that a lie? Was that an omission? That's not a lie?
MALE CLIENT: We're not at home fighting...
FEMALE CLIENT: Oh we're using synonyms so that you don't have to admit that you lied. It's ridiculous! He misled me. He did it on purpose. He lied to me! He didn't tell me he was out swimming with a girl and only told me three days later so when he told me he was out swimming, implying that he did it ","P1-N401231":"by himself, he lied!
THERAPIST: Well let me put this in a sort of particular framework it was interesting when you used the word "criminal." You guys are both in a courtroom now and each of you are on the witness stand. You take turns trying to explain your side of the story and the other person is yelling, "Perjury." ","P1-N401251":"(chuckle) To me this is a fundamental problem in your relationship. This is what your relationship is about or at least a big piece of it is about right now. That's a problem for the relationship. The facts for each of you are important and I don't want to completely dismiss them but this is the context ","P1-N401252":"of your relationship is a big problem. [00:44:24]
FEMALE CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. I mean our biggest problem is how we deal with our fights and how we argue and how we get over things. [00:45:22]
THERAPIST: Well it's very hard to (pause) deal with fights effectively when there's little trust. (chuckle) It's hard because there's not...people need a certain level of safety in a relationship to...
MALE CLIENT: I think the trust thing is a recent addition. It's not (pause)...it's just the fallout of events of the last two weeks is that. I don't think the core fundamental problem is the trust. It's...
THERAPIST: You feel it's more symptomatic?
MALE CLIENT: It's the way that we naturally and subconsciously deal with...whereas...I don't know. It's just (pause) we have a certain...everybody has a certain way of coping and dealing with fights and conflicts and resolving them and ours, (pause) it's like a square peg in a round hole. There's...I'm ","P1-N401311":"sure that ours would be completely effective in ways that would work properly but just not with each other. [00:46:25]
THERAPIST: Interesting. I realize that we're going to need to stop in a moment and this is what I'd like to do...I think I...well I don't know if I mentioned the first session, that the main move that I work with people is together obviously because it's helping you work on your relationship. I do typically ","P1-N401331":"early on meet with each of you individually because it helps me to sort of get a broader idea of who each of you are so I can help you more effectively as a couple. So what I'd like to do is the next session I'd like to meet with the two of you again because I want to get a little more of your interaction ","P1-N401332":"and then meet with each of you separately after that as the following two sessions. Does that sound okay?
FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. (pause) So let's...you don't have a...I will be able to make a regular time for you in the next couple of weeks. My schedule is a little bit more irregular over the next few weeks so why don't we find a time for next week and then I'll see what I have. It sounds like morning times are ","P1-N401371":"better for you, like an early morning time? Is that...
MALE CLIENT: Yeah that's good.
THERAPIST: Is that sort of the best option?
MALE CLIENT: Like seven...like right now, you mean? Today? [00:47:38]
THERAPIST: Yeah, do you ever have a slightly later in the morning? Because I'll have a couple of those times come up real soon. That would work, like eight or nine or is that going to interfere with your work schedule?
MALE CLIENT: Could you e-mail it again and then we could check?
THERAPIST: Sure, sure! I'm just trying to look...one thing I can do, I'm not here...well obviously next Wednesday is a holiday but I could meet (pause) next Thursday. I could do a seven...actually a couple of things. On Tuesday I could meet at 9:10. Is that...is that something that would work for you?
MALE CLIENT: I just have to make sure I check in with it but (pause) I think so. I think that would be...
THERAPIST: Okay, so I'll put you in for Tuesday at 9:10 and let me know if it doesn't work. I'll take another work and then maybe we can try to find a more regular time? Is that good? [00:48:35]
MALE CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And in terms of...so like I said you guys are going to get the reduced fee. Do you want me to use the credit card that you guys gave me last time or what would you like to do?
FEMALE CLIENT: Sure, you can do that. [00:48:46]
THERAPIST: Okay that's fine. (pause) Okay, very good. Oh, in terms of this, the company just started charging a few dollar fee, like $2.50 or something. I just want to make sure...
FEMALE CLIENT: To swipe the card you mean?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Is that okay? Because you don't have to do that if you do check but obviously it's not a lot of money but I don't want to charge your card something that you're not aware of.
FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, that's fine.
THERAPIST: So it would be like $2 or $2.50. Okay, I just wanted to check with you. Okay, so I have you guys down for 9:10. If you find out that doesn't work just let me know okay?
FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay. (background noise) Take care!
MALE CLIENT: Thanks. [00:49:25]
