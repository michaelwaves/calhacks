DESCRIPTION: Client discusses wanting to respond differently to conflicts; in a positive, rather than negative manner. Client also discusses feeling frustrated with her romantic partner's lack of responsibility and knowledge of basic day-to-day tasks.
THERAPIST: Hi. I’ll be with you in a moment.
CLIENT: How are you doing?
THERAPIST: Good, thank you.
CLIENT: I had a good week. Just busy working. Me and Steve really didn’t fight. And I’ve just been positive. No like drastic emotions or anything like that, so – just overwhelmed by school. And I started school and like all my schedule has kind of flip-flopped from days to nights so ","P1-N400131":"that’s challenging. Which I wanted to talk to you about because I won’t be able to come next week but if you have anything on Friday in the morning I might be able to come.
THERAPIST: I might have something – let me check.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I have 11:45.
CLIENT: On Friday?
THERAPIST: Yeah. Can you do that?
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: Actually, 11:50. So, 11:50?
CLIENT: Yeah, that’s fine.
THERAPIST: Okay. I’ll put you in for then. Okay.
CLIENT: I’ve just been feeling like panicky lately, just like right now coming here makes me a little anxious. But at work like when I have to go to my shift I feel like talking myself down because my heart starts racing with everything happening it’s randomly and nothing like seems to trigger ","P1-N400291":"it. I just feel real anxious and I just like take deep breaths and ignore it pretty much. Then in like an hour or so I seem more relaxed but it take me that long to relax.
THERAPIST: Did you get my e-mail about Dr. Levin?
CLIENT: Yeah. I called her today to see if I can make an appointment next week but the week after that for a four-hour session. We’ll see when she gets back. I don’t know what the fuck to talk about today. Is there anything that like we should talk about from like last week?
THERAPIST: What feels important to you?
CLIENT: I mean I’m happy about getting help. I feel I’m very positive about that. This week was normal, you know. Like I functioned well. I don’t know. I’ve just been really tired which is understandable with my job. That’s why I question why am I so tired? Is it my job ","P1-N400311":"or something else going on? I feel like I could go to sleep all day and like wake up and still feel tired. But my manager has me on days and then straight to nights for like four days. Like I’ll work Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday like day shift and then Thursday I’ll come in at like 11:30 or ","P1-N400312":"7:30 and then work nights for three days. It’s miserable. So that could be it. I just wish I had more energy pretty much. There is so much more I’d like to do other than just like work and sleep. But I don’t know. The floor is very busy. I’m not the only one. I like ask all the ","P1-N400313":"nurses just like do you ever just like you have a good stress but it’s like so stressful you just hold everything in and then you go home and you just fall apart? And they’re like, oh yeah, we do that once a week. I think that’s hard on my relationship because I’m always so preoccupied. ","P1-N400314":"Like yesterday I got home from work. I was fine and was outside and we live on a lake right by the water and the outside just felt relaxing. And he called on his way home and I was just like, hi. And he was like, I just said, hi, and he was like, is something wrong? And I’m like, that kind of ","P1-N400315":"– I was like why would there be anything wrong and then he got upset. Like, isn’t that a weird way to start a conversation?
THERAPIST: I’m not sure how to answer that (unclear). [00:08:00]
CLIENT: Like you say hi and the other person says, ‘is something wrong?’ I mean that’s weird. The question is how do you think something’s wrong if the person just said, hi. So I think after all this and like telling Steve that like emotionally something’s wrong he always ","P1-N400351":"thinks something’s wrong now. He’s always like concerned about me kind of. You’d think that would be nice but it’s kind of like aggravating. I mean I have bad days and good days but to feel like it’s going to be a bad day for me kind of like sets you up for failure. And ","P1-N400352":"then when he asks is something wrong? I’ll like read into it I’ll think why would there be anything wrong? Like, do you have a guilty conscience? Like I feel, I like read into stuff like that way too much. But when we got off the phone we were like (unclear) with each other and it’s ","P1-N400353":"just like something like that, then he just said he can’t talk to me. I’m like we’ve (unclear) to talk about it. I guess I don’t make good first impressions. So that’s like really aggravating. And then this week (unclear) said they were going to a wedding and I feel like ","P1-N400354":"it’s just like a burden, not something to look forward to for some reason. I wish I could get excited about social events and not just trying to like get through it. And I always think like whenever we go to anything social we’re going to fight. So I worry about that. It seems like it’s ","P1-N400355":"more like a pain in the ass than something happy.
THERAPIST: You just said, ‘we’re going to fight,’ and that upset you. [00:10:46]
CLIENT: I don’t know. Every time we go out we always like have some – we clash. Like someone always feels left out. He’s not very social so he’ll like sit down and he feels ignored like ‘you didn’t even sit next to me or something like that. You didn’t spend ","P1-N400391":"time with me. So it usually escalates. But at this wedding I only know the bride so it’s not like it’s very social and he doesn’t like to dance. I don’t know. Any time we go out anywhere we always have some misunderstanding and we get in a fight. And it’s like either I’m ","P1-N400392":"setting myself up to fight with him like I’m not going into it positively or it’s just like us clashing anytime at stressful events or (unclear). [00:12:14]
THERAPIST: By setting yourself up, developing your theme and you’re acting on it somehow?
CLIENT: Yeah. Subconsciously. Like I guess if you have negative thoughts and that stresses you out if you think negatively and you’re like a tense person and then somebody just like is being tough with you.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: He knows me. He knows how I react to things. And that sets him off. Like we’re just like reacting to each other. So I’m kind of stressed out about that. The whole wedding.
CLIENT: Is there like any advice you could give me?
THERAPIST: About what to do?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like what would kind of – what would you want to do differently?
CLIENT: Like just think. Think more positively like I’m not so stressed out before I go to a social event.
THERAPIST: So you’d like to change your thoughts.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I see. And how would you do that?
CLIENT: Instead of like being stressed out I’d be excited.
THERAPIST: I see. So you’d just have different thoughts?
CLIENT: Hmm.
THERAPIST: I don’t know how to control one’s thoughts. It sounds great.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, like just being more positive. Have you ever been in a situation where you’re like just nervous and how to like self-talk yourself through it?
THERAPIST: I see. What would that self-talk look like?
CLIENT: Just like you’re going to have a good time.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Nothing’s going to go wrong. Like, just relax.
THERAPIST: So you’d say reassuring things to yourself.
CLIENT: Right. And moods. I think I go like overboard or like I’ll start planning like the wedding or whatever, and getting everything together so like I’m not stressed out. But if I don’t have enough time to prepare myself I just feel like I’m stressed going to the wedding.
THERAPIST: And it’s particularly because you’ll be going with Steve and you’re worried about fighting?
CLIENT: I don’t know. That’s part of it. I just get like social anxiety.
CLIENT: And I’ll probably get tired. I think I need reassurance and he reacts. When I figure out how to control that.
THERAPIST: What do you get anxious about in social situations?
CLIENT: Like I would say like, I don’t know. Everything? It’s different if I don’t know anybody there and have a good time. If I know people I feel like, I don’t know, somehow I have to impress them. Like dress really nice and be perfect. I’m like I’m a perfectionist ","P1-N400771":"when I go.
THERAPIST: So you have to be perfect for them or for you?
CLIENT: For them.
THERAPIST: Because that’s what other people expect of you?
CLIENT: I don’t believe that’s what they expect of me. I don’t know what I do that.
CLIENT: It’s kind of stressful.
CLIENT: It’s like I don’t know what (unclear). I feel like it’s just going to be like a date night for me and Steve. Have a nice dinner, get to dance. We don’t really know anybody so –
THERAPIST: What is it about knowing someone that makes you – or knowing the people there that makes you more anxious?
CLIENT: I don’t know. I guess like judgment. I think it’s more I get anxious and then when I’m there I realize like it’s not the worst situation and I usually have a good time. It’s just like I get stressed like on the way there. Like are we going to be late? We’re ","P1-N4008B1":"always like feeling we don’t have enough time and then we’re running late and I feel bad about that. Like it seems like things don’t go the way I plan and it seems like that’s what frustrates me.
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: It must be a control thing.
THERAPIST: What do you fear will happen if things don’t go as planned?
CLIENT: I think I fear like just being anxious or like my mood I fear will be disappointed. You know?
CLIENT: It doesn’t make any sense.
THERAPIST: What might you feel disappointed by?
CLIENT: Like if we’re going to have a good – like getting excited about having a good time and then we don’t have a good time. Like Steve has situations, like Steve worries about money. Of course he worries about dressing up and everything but it’s like he always just feels bad ","P1-N4009D1":"(unclear) like not being able to like pay for a drink or whatever. He worries about that. And his mood affects my mood.
THERAPIST: What does he do when he can’t pay for a drink?
CLIENT: He kind of just like, he doesn’t do anything. He finally relaxes and understands like I’ll give him some money to pay for the drinks, whatever. And like in the beginning he doesn’t really make me feel bad but I feel bad because what he says is like, I feel really bad about ","P1-N400A11":"not having any money to pay for things. It’s like I feel horrible. And that like makes me feel horrible. You know?
CLIENT: I wish we could just go out and have fun.
CLIENT: So I should probably start thinking about the wedding. And it’s my mother’s birthday on the wedding. And my father wants me to stop by there first so it will give me even less time.
CLIENT: I think it’s normal anxiety that other people have, just intensified. Just very intense.
THERAPIST: Well, it also seems important to you to be able to determine what’s normal and what’s not. You use those terms a lot – that’s normal, that’s weird. Trying to kind of organize things somehow.
CLIENT: I guess, categorize them. Well, because I always over-react about things so it’s like, for me it’s like how everybody acts and what am I over-reacting about and what needs to be an extreme case and how should I behave in a situation in a like positive way? That’s like with ","P1-N400B11":"my relationship, it’s like I feel when like something happens it’s like the worst, the end of the world. But I don’t know what it’s like, what I should be upset about and like how to react. Do you know what I mean? Like, is it just me making things up in my head or is it something ","P1-N400B12":"I should pay attention to? Like a judgment.
THERAPIST: And that feels confusing.
CLIENT: Um hmm.
CLIENT: Nowadays, it’s kind of like I can’t say that, probably like for this whole week like if me and Steve act like (unclear) I wouldn’t carry it out I was kind of quiet or like going to bed and ignoring it. But it’s just like it’s still there. Instead of being aggressive ","P1-N400B91":"about it and trying to analyze everything and trying to talk about it with him. I can’t – I really don’t know how to talk things out with him. He like tunes me out. Sometimes it’s like easier to avoid things, which works for our relationship I guess, because we’re not fighting.
THERAPIST: But something else is missing or not working.
CLIENT: We don’t have an intimacy at all and like I’ve brought this up before and he blames it on me because I said he had a problem and now he has like performance anxiety and then I take that as he doesn’t find me attractive. So it’s like – it’s a mess. So we both ","P1-N400BD1":"don’t know where to get through that wall to get to where we were before. Because we were always like so into each other, very, very attracted to each other and now I don’t know how to react.
CLIENT: Which is what? It’s dysfunctional.
THERAPIST: Because it feels like coming together can be – go badly, sexually and otherwise it sounds like which is why you feel anxious being with him at a wedding and what would happen. Well on sort of a practical level I’ve thought about this for the past couple of weeks and it seems like ","P1-N400C31":"for a few reasons we decided the two of us to meet individually versus couples and I enjoy meeting with you and I think that this – we should keep doing this. I do. And I do wonder whether you guys could also see someone separately and see someone other than me, the two of you, and maybe closer ","P1-N400C32":"to home so that some of the logistical problems you were having could be kind of cut down, be minimized. What do you think about that?
CLIENT: I don’t know if he’d go for that. And Tuesdays are his only day off and that’s the problem that he can’t fit anything else in. He likes just to do his own thing.
CLIENT: I’ll talk to him about it.
THERAPIST: He came here. He did. Unless that was an illusion. Do you have any reservations on your part?
CLIENT: Well, he tells me that there’s nothing we need to do in therapy that we can’t fix on our own. He says that it’s our responsibility to fix it and not to see somebody. He doesn’t believe like that’s necessary. So I’m like, okay. And it’s like pick and ","P1-N400CD1":"choose your battles, you know. He’s so dead set on not seeing somebody, I can’t force him.
THERAPIST: But he came here. He did come here.
CLIENT: I think it was just an extreme case of like I don’t know. I think I like forced him to come here. And I don’t want to do that. I want him to feel like, okay. You know. I’d said to him, if you want to work on our relationship I have a therapist and it’s either that or ","P1-N400D11":"we might break up. Like I gave him an ultimatum or I threatened him and I mean he came here but he wasn’t happy about it. And like getting him here was the most stressful thing. And the car ride was horrible.
THERAPIST: Because he was complaining?
CLIENT: Because he was just being quiet and he wouldn’t talk.
THERAPIST: And that’s when I know like something’s wrong with him because he’ll just get quiet and ignore me. He’s in his own – I take it that he’s ignoring me. He’s not ignoring me. You just can feel the tension in the car, you know? That’s stressful.
CLIENT: But that’s why you’d be going to a couple’s therapist, because there’s tension in your relationship.
THERAPIST: That’s true.
CLIENT: I don’t want to make you do something you don’t want to do, for sure. It was an idea.
THERAPIST: If there’s something (unclear) we can do I want to talk to you about your role in it and your distress in it, too, but – You guys talked when you were here.
CLIENT: Did we?
THERAPIST: Um hmm. You did.
CLIENT: Yeah. It’s hard to remember it. Only therapists had afternoon sessions.
THERAPIST: I’m sorry?
CLIENT: Only therapists have afternoon sessions, like evening.
THERAPIST: Some therapists do.
CLIENT: They do?
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: Oh, okay. That would help.
THERAPIST: That would be your concern logistically?
CLIENT: Um hmm. I would have a time getting him like to go get his GED like after work or something like that.
THERAPIST: When is he done with work usually?
CLIENT: It’s different every day. If he gets a day shift he’ll be home at like 4, but usually he has evenings or nights so sometimes he goes into work at like 12. Yeah, maybe we could do a morning session if I was working nights. But he sleeps like until he has to go to work, he’ll ","P1-N400F91":"sleep and he wouldn’t get up. And he’s like a monster in the morning. You can’t even talk to him for like a couple of hours.
THERAPIST: Just one woman’s experience, but he didn’t seem like a monster to me when he came here in the morning.
CLIENT: Yeah. He’s good at putting on a show. No. He’s good at like in front of people being very charismatic and friendly, but like in the morning he’s – you can’t even talk to him and he tells me that. I’m just not awake, just please give me time, I’m not ","P1-N400FD1":"awake yet. A very different person to live with. Like I see the good side of him like you saw, like I know that’s there. It’s just living with each other. I didn’t expect it to be like – I expected him to like me as his girlfriend and like to be not so comfortable all the time ","P1-N400FD2":"like you are with your family. And I feel like he moved in and he acted like the same way he acted at his house, like his mother took care of the cleaning, and like made him lunch and like mothered him. So like he doesn’t do anything – he doesn’t do anything for himself, you know. ","P1-N400FD3":"So it’s aggravating. And he very much likes me to do stuff for him, like make his lunch or do his laundry and clean up, but I don’t look at a relationship that way.
THERAPIST: Those categories aren’t important.
CLIENT: No, I guess functional – he wasn’t functional. And I consider functional as like normal for us here. It was chaotic. And he blamed it on working which I didn’t sympathize with because I work a lot of hours, a lot of different hours and I just feel that I have responsibilities ","P1-N401051":"that I need to take care of. And we had a roommate so. That was a different story. Like he had to leave the apartment a mess because there was someone else he had living there, too.
CLIENT: In fact, I think that affected our relationship and I feel like now I’m stuck in like this mother role for him and I’m sure he doesn’t like that either but he’s put me in that weird position. Do you think we can get out of such a habit?
THERAPIST: The two of you, or him?
CLIENT: The two of us.
THERAPIST: I certainly think it’s possible which I think it’s why going back to couple’s therapy would be helpful. I don’t know – I guess you could do it on your own.
CLIENT: Couples therapy?
THERAPIST: Well, you’re saying you could do it on your own – like his philosophy, like you can do it on your own. That you can do it on your own versus going to see somebody.
CLIENT: I think I can change myself, you know. I don’t think I can change him.
THERAPIST: When you ask that, are you concerned when you say, ‘do you think you can change that?’
CLIENT: I would just – I would hope from a professional’s point of view.
THERAPIST: Did you find when we met – the three of us, to be helpful?
CLIENT: I felt like he treated me better. He was nicer. He seems like he really tried, like he was kind of like responsible for something because we met every week and he would make – he would say held make like a commitment and then he’d (unclear) a commitment, you know. Whereas, if we’re ","P1-N4011D1":"at home he could say these things like I’m going to do this or I’m going to do that but he forgets or he just doesn’t follow through. And I think that’s like what started it the night of the dinner. I was just like really disappointed. And it’s like should I be disappointed? ","P1-N4011D2":"Should I be grateful that he tried? Probably. But it’s like he had all day to do that, to think about which (unclear). I pretty much thought it up for him. And he didn’t know what pot to use. He doesn’t know how long to boil something. He had to ask me about everything. Like, my God, ","P1-N4011D3":"how would you ever – like liver on your own? You know. So I guess I’m like, judging him, but I just don’t understand I think.
THERAPIST: Judging him in what way?
CLIENT: Like do you not feel about not knowing how to boil water kind of thing, you know? Like I don’t understand that. I really don’t. You don’t know how to cook spaghetti. I’ve seen him do it so it’s like, why is he asking me?
CLIENT: Like when he still relies on me so much – I don’t like that.
THERAPIST: What does it feel like?
CLIENT: Like I’m his mother. You know? I used to love it, like that was like the old me. Like I used to love caring for people. Now that I have a job of it it’s like – it’s excessive. It’s a lot. It would be nice if he was a little more independent. Like his, you know, ","P1-N401291":"idea of cooking is like having a bowl of ice cream. That’s his dinner and like that’s fine. Like most people, they live together – a lot of people, they have dinner together and either the boyfriend cooks or the girlfriend cooks. And there’s like function inside of – like ","P1-N401292":"I try maybe if we go grocery shopping to pick up stuff like he would want to like cook and stuff but I’d be buying grocery that he would never touch. He like eats at work or he’ll bring home drinks or something that’s a) not healthy, or, b) like it’s expensive to do that as opposed ","P1-N401293":"to we’ll just buy groceries, you know, and pack a lunch. But I don’t think that would ever change it. For one, he doesn’t leave himself enough time, you know?
CLIENT: I don’t know why it just seems like such a big deal for me. I don’t know it just feels like you cook, you have dinner together, you take care of the house together and you do things together, you know, to help make your relationship grow. We do everything separate. And that makes it so –
THERAPIST: Does it make you feel alone?
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. It makes me feel like I have other responsibility that I don’t have if I (unclear) with him. (inaudible) together. It’s like I have a roommate that sleeps next to me. Like today I had to say like, why don’t you take your laundry to your mother’s house, ","P1-N401311":"she said she would help you clean it. But if I didn’t say that he wouldn’t do that. He would wait until I came home, you know? And I ended up taking his laundry to my mother’s house.
THERAPIST: Because he doesn’t know how to do laundry?
CLIENT: Yes. Unless she’s there to help him, he doesn’t. But his mother did his laundry.
THERAPIST: So what is your concern in having to do his laundry? I’m not sure I understand.
CLIENT: I guess that he’s not independent enough to do that stuff on his own.
THERAPIST: Do you feel like he would just wear dirty clothes? Like what would happen if you didn’t do it?
CLIENT: He does wear dirty clothes.
THERAPIST: So you think for months and months he’d wear dirty clothes?
CLIENT: Not months and months. No. He’ll eventually won’t, but he will wear some dirty clothes to work. I don’t know. It’s like he doesn’t take the initiative until it’s too late, until it’s like the last minute and then he’ll say to me, oh my God, I need ","P1-N401411":"you to do my laundry. And then I feel like I guess that’s my fault and I’m like, okay, I’ll do your laundry but I feel bad and I want to help him but like I feel I’m enabling him to do things for himself. Isn’t that silly?
THERAPIST: Well, I guess I’m not sure what you’re wanting to help him do in those moments.
CLIENT: I feel bad that he feels bad that he didn’t get to do his laundry. I don’t want him to feel bad, you know. I want him to be happy so I feel like if I help him with these things, he’ll be happy. And I’m the one that gets burned, not him.
THERAPIST: So you feel you’re taking the burden off of him, but then you feel the burden and then you feel angry at him which makes him unhappy and defeats the very purpose that you (unclear) in the first place.
CLIENT: Right. And then he’ll say, well you didn’t have to do it. I didn’t ask you do to it. And then I’m like, and you don’t feel grateful, and adds to the cycle. Like one day I was at work and he was like, oh, I cleaned. I cleaned up a little bit and I was like, oh, wow. ","P1-N401491":"He took the initiative to clean? And like I told one of my co-workers and I was like, wow, and I was so excited. And when I got home I could not tell what he’d cleaned. I had no idea what he’d cleaned. I was like, oh, thank you.
THERAPIST: Did you ask him?
CLIENT: Nope. I could not tell and I didn’t want to fight with him. You know? So I was like disappointed. I don’t think he knows how to clean. He watches me do it, but – I don’t – if I start cleaning he’ll be like, do you want me to mop that? And he’s like, ","P1-N4014D1":"okay, and then he’ll mop. But it’s like taking the initiative and doing it like if I come home at night and the living room’s clean and I don’t have to worry about that.
THERAPIST: (Unclear proper name), we’re going to need to stop for today.
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: So I’ll see you in a week from Friday at 11:50.
CLIENT: All right.
THERAPIST: Okay. Take care.
CLIENT: Oh, about the bill and everything? Did you figure that out?
THERAPIST: No, my assistant came back at the end of last week and she’ll look into it.
CLIENT: Okay. Could you have her to just e-mail me again to see what one’s I should e-mail my insurance.
THERAPIST: Oh, she’s been submitting it the last couple of months.
CLIENT: Yeah, I’m just not sure that they’re happy about that. They want me to for some reason.
THERAPIST: Okay, well I think they’re – okay, I’ll give her July on. I’ll have her e-mail you July and I guess August, now, since it’s the end of the month.
CLIENT: Okay. Thank you.
THERAPIST: Okay. Take care.
