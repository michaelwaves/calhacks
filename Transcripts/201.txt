TITLE: Client "SRH" Therapy Session Audio Recording, October 17, 2013: Client discusses her issues with weight, and her fear that she does not have control of her relationship and fears that she will lose her girlfriend.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her issues with weight, and her fear that she does not have control of her relationship and fears that she will lose her girlfriend.
THERAPIST: Hi! Come on in! Just grab some water.
CLIENT: Sure. (pause) Hi!
THERAPIST: Hi! How are you doing?
CLIENT: Okay. I haven't been feeling that great yesterday or today, so I'm feeling frustrated that that's happening again. [00:01:06]
THERAPIST: Not great in what way?
CLIENT: My stomach. I had like, a flare-up of whatever; it was happening yesterday. And it was probably from something I ate, because last time I had symptoms, I had this like, particular kind of yogurt as well. But I think like, when I get nervous about it... It's weird, having actual stomach issues, ","P1-N400151":"because when I feel stressed and anxious, then I usually get like a little like, anxiety stomachache, you know? And so it's odd having... because... an actual stomach issue, because then, when I worry about it, it makes it worse, so... Then it's like, hard not to, it's hard to stop that from happening. ","P1-N400152":"And then I don't know what's like, real or... I mean, it's all real, because I feel it, but I don't know what it's caused from, me being stressed out about what's going on with my stomach and what's being caused by my actual stomach issue. [00:02:03]
THERAPIST: And what do you start to worry about?
CLIENT: Whether it's healing, and what's going on, and why I'm having this symptom or that symptom, is it a side effect of the medication, this isn't... You know, like this isn't supposed to be what... And it also feels like, and I don't know... I just start like, thinking about all the other things ","P1-N400191":"that could be going on. (therapist responds)
THERAPIST: Well, I guess part of patience is sort of bearing uncertainty. (client affirms) Do you think that's what's hard? [00:03:07]
CLIENT: Yeah, I'm nervous that on December 3rd, when I go in for the endoscopy, they're going to tell me that it's not healed, you know. (pause) Because it's shitty, right now, like not eating anything I want to be eating, and I don't have, I haven't been working out a lot. I just went for a pretty ","P1-N4001F1":"pitiful (chuckles) jog after work. I don't have the energy. So it's just frustrating, and so yeah, I'm nervous that like, for some reason, it's going to take longer to heal or... Or something else is going on, that is preventing it from healing, or something like that.
THERAPIST: And do you get particular ideas of what's preventing it or just this fear like something is preventing it?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause) So I'm just trying to be patient. (chuckles) [00:04:16]
THERAPIST: And what does "trying to be patient" feel like?
CLIENT: (pause) I feel like I'm not being patient, you know, like... it feels like... I don't know. I keep like, reminding... I just feel like I'm constantly reminding myself like, "You're fine!" You know? So... (pause) I think it's frustrating, because usually what makes me feel better is when I like, ","P1-N400271":"get a good workout in, you know. And since I'm not doing that, I don't feel like I have... like any way to release any of the stress that I'm feeling. So I feel like I'm just like, I'm just like sitting with it. It's not going anywhere. [00:05:34]
THERAPIST: So it feels kind of pent up?
CLIENT: (affirms) Yeah. (pause) And like the other, two days ago, I finally like, I went for a run for the first time since I got sick. And it was great, and it felt great, and I felt great the rest of the night, you know. Then the next day, I got sick again. So it was just like... I finally was like ","P1-N4002B1":"celebrating that I was really, like felt like I was on the mend and doing well, and was feeling good, you know. And then yesterday, I got sick again, so it was just like... I don't know. It all got taken away. (chuckles) So... [00:06:27]
THERAPIST: Right, there is one thing, feeling crap; then, there is another thing, feeling crap about yourself!
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I don't know, I don't know if it's like a combination of both, or one or the other. It's not like one or the other, I don't think. But I'm just like... You know, I don't feel, I'm, I guess not about myself, but, well, a little bit. I'm frustrated with my body. I don't understand ","P1-N400331":"why this is like happening, and it's prolonged, and like I just want to get over it.
THERAPIST: Like, it's something that you can't control, but you desperately want to? (client affirms)
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, because it's like, these are things that I know, like that usually make me feel better. So I want to be able to have that feeling again. I want to feel like, energized and like, I want to socialize with my friends, and you know like, I'm excited about the day or something. And ","P1-N4003B1":"so, yeah, it's hard for me to like, let go of it and be like, "Oh, well, like you're not going to... Like you're going to feel sick and you're not going to exercise for a while." It's like... I feel like I shouldn't just let that happen.
THERAPIST: (chuckles) What's the alternative?
CLIENT: I don't know; I guess being cranky about it! (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I see. So you can either accept that or feel badly and be cranky. [00:09:40]
CLIENT: I guess. I don't know. I feel like I want to keep trying to, and like figure out like what, you know, like... I want to figure out like why, what's making me not feel well today, you know? Like, I barely ate anything today, so it can't be food, you know?
THERAPIST: It could be not eating anything today (chuckles), too!
CLIENT: That's true. But what I did eat was like, full of protein and you know, I had like peanut butter and then like, brown rice and avocado. Like, I am eating smartly, because I'm not able to eat a lot, so... But I guess it's still not that much food, so it would make sense that I don't feel like ","P1-N400471":"super energized. But... I don't know.
THERAPIST: It sounds like a really hard task.
CLIENT: Yeah. Because you can't like, you know, you get a headache, you don't know why you have a headache. (therapist affirms) But I sit there and I want, like I want to know exactly what's going on, like why I'm having a headache.
THERAPIST: And if you can figure that out, what, how does it help?
CLIENT: (pause) It like calms me down if I know like, if there is something... Like I remember last week, I was having really bad cramps and I couldn't take anything for it. But I didn't feel that stressed about it, because it was like a pain I was having, but I knew where it was coming from. It was ","P1-N400511":"like a normal reaction, it's a normal reaction for females to have that, like once a month, you know? So like it, kind of, it was like not worrisome to me, because I knew where it was coming from, and I knew that it was nothing to be worried about, that it was normal. [00:11:46]
THERAPIST: Sounds (inaudible) something, you catastrophize. (client affirms) Why would something really bad be wrong?
CLIENT: I don't know. It doesn't make much sense, because I'm, aside from having this like whatever ulcer I have, like I'm a healthy 28-year old, you know? Like... when other healthy 28-year olds get a headache or a stomach ache, you know, they're like, "Oh..." You know, like it's not, it's not like ","P1-N400571":"I'm in my 50s or 60s and like you're really, you know, could be something. Like, when you do have to worry about other things going on. But I don't know. [00:12:49]
THERAPIST: What is it?
CLIENT: Kena Hora syndrome? [00:14:39]
THERAPIST: I didn't even know...
CLIENT: That's what she called it. I don't know. I think, my mom like it's, like old Jewish women say this word, "kena hora," it's like, don't, you know, like "knock on wood" kind of thing.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Yeah. I think it's like a Yiddish term, I don't know.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: I've heard it growing up, so I know the context in which it belongs, but I don't know like what exactly it means? But that's, I feel like I'm like, waiting for something bad to happen, because it's like, too good to be true, basically. Like, I never imagined that I would be with... Amelia is ","P1-N4006B1":"literally the girl of my dreams. You know, and I like, never imagined that I would ever, because I spent so many years like, falling for these straight women who, no matter what I did or how I changed my body, would ever fall for me back, because, you know, it wasn't, and it wasn't personal. It was ","P1-N4006B2":"just... you know. And now I feel like something is going to, and I think that's why like, I'm so worried all the time, that something bad is going to happen to Amelia, because... like, it's just, it's like, too good to be true. So, it's going to be taken away from me. [00:15:37]
THERAPIST: That what you have is so tenuous and fragile. (client affirms) Almost like it's an illusion. I mean, it's not quite an illusion, but it's not quite real either. (client affirms) Too good to be true is something that isn't real.
CLIENT: Yeah. Because I just never, I always thought, I like had totally accepted the fact that I would never, like have what I have right now. (pause) So I feel like the longer it goes on, the more convinced I am that like, "Okay, now it's, we're really close to like when something bad is going to happen."
THERAPIST: (pause) So it's not really yours; it's kind of just this stage (inaudible)? [00:16:45]
CLIENT: (affirms) (pause) Yeah. I know. I just like, for some reason, I don't, and I don't know why. Like, I don't feel like I consciously beat myself up over stuff, but like, I, for some reason, I don't feel like I deserve like, any of what I have. And, it's hard to explain, because I don't feel like, ","P1-N400731":"I can't sit here and be like, "Well like, this is what's wrong with me, this is why I don't deserve this." But I just, it's just that like general feeling that, like I haven't, like I don't know.
THERAPIST: So it seems like, on the one hand, you want to control like, something from going really wrong. But on the other hand, you feel like it's an inevitability.
CLIENT: (affirms) So, I feel like I'm trying my best to like, stop it from happening, but like... It's like when I'm not around... Like with Amelia, for example, like when I'm not around, I'm like, "Well, if I'm not there, like I can't..." And she like kind of laughs about this, because like if something, ","P1-N400791":"if like someone were to come like, try something with her on the street, like I, you know, she's twice my size and twice as strong as I am. Like, I wouldn't be, I'm not going to, me, like little old me being there is not going to stop anything, you know? I feel like in my head, I'm like, "As long as ","P1-N400792":"like, we're together like, nothing's going to happen."
THERAPIST: (pause) Well, if you don't deserve what you have, what do you deserve? [00:19:06]
CLIENT: I don't know. And that like, scares me to think about. I don't know. I was just so used to like always being upset, you know? Like, I was always either, I was just, used to always like... wanting things I didn't have, specifically with like, relationships, I think. Not... because I grew up very ","P1-N4007D1":"privileged; it wasn't about like, when I wanted clothes or money or material things, that I didn't have.
THERAPIST: And so that's what you deserve?
CLIENT: I don't think I deserve that, necessarily, you know? Because I was pretty shitty also. I was scared of it, I'm scared that that's what, like you know, that's what I'm scared of. I don't want to go back to that. I'm very scared of putting on weight, I'm very scared of losing Amelia, you know ","P1-N400851":"like, those things make me, then it's like terrifying to think about.
THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?
CLIENT: If I have anything else to say (chuckles) about this subject.
THERAPIST: The thought I had, I'm not sure what this looks like exactly, but the immediate thought I had after you said that is, maybe you have to face the terror and maybe it will make it less terrifying.
CLIENT: (affirms) But what would that mean, like... for like, you know what I mean, like... how would I face the terror without actually like... losing Amelia or getting fat again? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well, facing the terror is about facing the feeling. (client affirms) It's not like, it's not actualizing what you're terrified about. (client affirms) And it's definitely this terror that things will just fall apart, completely fall apart. (client affirms)
CLIENT: Still just whether I have anything else to say about it, but... No, that's it, yeah.
THERAPIST: Where would you be if things fell apart?
CLIENT: I mean, I don't know. I'm like, need to find a new apartment, because I wouldn't be able to stay in like, the apartment that we made together. I feel like I would have to like, leave Boston, you know? Like, I like, we moved here together, Amelia and I. And like everything like, reminds me of ","P1-N4009B1":"her. I feel like I wouldn't, I don't' know what I would do. I'd probably re-apply to the Red Cross (chuckles); just leave. Do something like that. (therapist responds)
THERAPIST: Well, on the one hand, you feel fragile and on the other hand, you feel she's fragile. [00:28:44]
CLIENT: (pause) Even though she's not. She's like, the opposite, you know? She's like the strongest, one of the strongest women I've ever met. And I like know she can, you know, like we joke. I have this like, I hate flying, because I feel really like not... Like if I could have it my way, I would drive ","P1-N400A71":"everywhere. And I don't let anybody else drive my car. Like, I have this thing, I like very much like to be in control. And so I can't stand...
THERAPIST: I would have guessed that... [00:29:20]
CLIENT: ...flying, yeah. I mean, even taking a train. Like, it's better on the train than it is on a plane, but like I really get all like... Somehow on public transportation, I'm fine. Like, when I'm just going to work and stuff, but like flying is just the... and I didn't used to have that. I used ","P1-N400AB1":"to love flying, you know? And I fly a lot, because I travel a lot. And I don't remember when it started getting bad; must have been sometime in college but...
THERAPIST: The "Amelia in the world" is not fragile; the "Amelia inside you" can be fragile. (client affirms)
CLIENT: Just about the fact that like, now I'm just sitting here getting anxious about when we have to fly out to Oregon in December (therapist affirms), and about the fact that like, I'm already like worried that I'm going to be really anxious the whole time she's in Philadelphia. So I was thinking ","P1-N400B91":"about what I'm going to do while (chuckles) she's in Philadelphia.
THERAPIST: What did you come up with?
CLIENT: Nothing yet. But we have, she flies out on a Thursday morning, at 5:30 in the morning. So I'll have to like, get up and take her to the airport, but we have a fund raiser that night, so that's just going to be, I feel like it's going to be a ridiculous day, because I'm going to be sleep deprived, ","P1-N400BD1":"which always makes me more anxious.
THERAPIST: It does? I wonder if she ever, in these moments, if she ends up representing a part of yourself, of you, that doesn't feel like you're going to be okay.
CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) I mean, at the end of the day, it is like, you know, in a selfish way, like it is about me, because if something were to happen to her, then I don't think that I would be okay.
THERAPIST: It seems like free-floating anxiety of things not being okay can get grafted onto physical symptoms, especially when you're not feeling well. (client affirms) And then that sort of becomes the focus.
CLIENT: Yeah, and usually like, I'm able to like, I have, I like constantly have a stomach ache because... And I know it's from my anxiety, and I know it's from stress, because there is like a clear correlation or relationship between the two like... all the time, you know? Like, when I'm not anxious ","P1-N400CB1":"and when I'm feeling relaxed, I don't have stomach issues. And now, because I do have this ulcer (that's not caused by, it might be caused a little bit by my stress, but like most likely caused by that medication I was taking, it's, I don't know), it's like I can usually just brush, like I just live ","P1-N400CB2":"with my stomach aches. They don't really affect my daily life too much, you know? I've like learned how to just deal with it, because it's like, for me, I know that it's like psychosomatic. I don't really feel like something's really wrong with me. But now that there is something that needs to heal ","P1-N400CB3":"and needs time, I feel like I can't just like, usually what I would brush off as like a nervous, anxious stomach ache, I can't like just brush it off, you know? Because then I'm wondering like, "Well, is this related to the ulcer, is this related to the medication I'm on like..." You know. So... I feel ","P1-N400CB4":"like it's all just like a perfect storm right now. (chuckles) And it's making me feel just like... really on edge all the time.
THERAPIST: Do you feel yourself worrying more right now?
CLIENT: Yeah, I was just thinking that it's making me like anxious, thinking about it. And talking about it.
THERAPIST: What, anxious about what in particular?
CLIENT: Um, no I'm just like now thinking about like, my stomach and how I just want, like I just want these next couple of months just to be over, so I can like, I just want to like fast-forward to when... this is like... healed.
THERAPIST: (pause) You don't want to be present for the healing process?
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I feel like because when I, you know, in college when I first started exercising a lot and when I did like, lose all that weight initially, it coincided with the time when I came out and was becoming more comfortable with myself and getting good grades. I feel like I associate ","P1-N400D91":"like, a lot of my happiness to my physical wellbeing. I just think, because like that just all happened at the same time. [00:40:40]
THERAPIST: Well, it seems like that's in part, because you feel you can control your body and then you can control how you feel, and that feels good. But when you're confronted with situations where you can't control your body, that throws everything out of whack. [00:41:48]
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I mean yeah. I have huge control issues. Anytime I feel like I'm not in control makes me really anxious. Even so, Amelia's birthday is next Saturday. I am trying to put together like, a surprise party at the apartment. But even in deciding like whether to have people at the apartment ","P1-N400DF1":"or for us to go someplace else makes me like... You know like, right, if I have people over to the apartment like, I'm not going to be able to just decide when, you know, it's totally out of my hands. Like, the apartment might get messy, people might stay really late, I'm not going to be able to...
THERAPIST: Hmm. It's interesting.
CLIENT: I don't know.
THERAPIST: It seems like a sort of interesting line of thought to pursue. You know, Kelsey (sp), we're going to need to stop for today, okay? I will see you next week?
CLIENT: Yeah, see you next week!
THERAPIST: Great! (pause) Take care!
CLIENT: You, too. Have a good weekend!
THERAPIST: Thank you!
