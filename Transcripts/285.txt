DESCRIPTION: Client discusses a major event that happened during her summer vacation and whether or not she handled the situation as best she could. Client discusses if she feels jealous or fearful of people who have more power and prestige than her.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.
CLIENT: (Breathing heavily) [I had to run here] (ph). (Pause) [0:06:00]
THERAPIST: What happened that you had to run?
CLIENT: (Chuckling) I just lost track of time. I took too long in the shower. I was working out, and I didn't estimate (chuckling) properly. (Pause) I'm out of shape (chuckling). [0:06:59] I was thinking about what you said, that I get into this mode of... like, when I don't think? And I think we were... ","P1-N400131":"I mean, I want to understand that comment a bit more obviously. But I was... because you said this in reference to me going to see a counselor in India, right?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, partly (ph), yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah, so, I mean, I remembered that I actually was very divided about going to see a counselor because I... my first thought was, well, I already have a counselor. And, you know, granted that she's faraway, and I'd have to... you know, I was figuring out how to get in touch. I was thinking maybe ","P1-N400171":"e-mail, maybe Skype, maybe phone. [0:08:00] But then the guy whose house we were staying at, he was very... and (inaudible at 0:08:10) was very respectable, come from a very famous, respectable family. (Chuckling) So I was feeling a little conscious of that. But he'd worked with women in worse situations, ","P1-N400172":"and I just wanted to... I guess from more out curiosity? Like, anthropological curiosity? I was like, huh, I want to see what the center is like, what kind of services they provide. And so that was kind of my thinking or non-thinking behind the decision to go and check them out. [0:08:56] I was just ","P1-N400173":"curious why that concerned you, going to see a counselor and...
THERAPIST: Well, it didn't concern me. I just thought it was... I mean, there was some meaning to it, why you'd think someone who's a stranger to you would be more helpful than me.
CLIENT: Yeah, so I didn't understand... I didn't think that they would be helpful if... like I said, it was more out curiosity? And then I did think, this guy has... is really insisting that I go see this person. So maybe he knows a little bit more about these situations than I do. I don't know. The ","P1-N4001B1":"whole thing was weird, and I just didn't know how much of it to expose to other people and how much of it not to, because after (inaudible at 0:09:48) e-mail came, I was little bit... because she'd also tried to psychoanalyze me and stuff. Like, she'd said to Chris, maybe she has a problem with authority ","P1-N4001B2":"figures. Maybe something happened in her childhood, and she's just projecting on... projecting it on my father (chuckling). [0:10:09] And I was a bit weirded out by that, and I was actually... maybe part of me was buying into it. I was like, huh. Maybe... am I blowing this out of proportion? What is ","P1-N4001B3":"the mature way of handling this? What would other women do? Would they just shrug it off and pretend that it never happened and just move on? And I was like, why can't I do that (chuckling)? Why am I so bothered by it?
THERAPIST: She'll... I'm sorry, who's she?
CLIENT: The friend, the woman whose (ph)...
THERAPIST: She'll... but how was she...? She'll do what? Why was she in...?
CLIENT: Well, I don't know. So I told them about the e-mail she sent, and they were all concerned that she might actually come out and harm me in some way, because she sounded very pissed and (inaudible at 0:11:54).
THERAPIST: What did you write her? [0:11:58]
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: What did you say when you wrote her?
CLIENT: Do you want me to show you the exchange?
THERAPIST: You don't... I mean, I'm just wondering what you wrote. I didn't...
CLIENT: Yeah, no, I have... I mean, [in a way there's a] (ph) gigantic hole in my heart. So instead of me... I mean, I've already summarized it to you. But I won't look at it, so (chuckling)... because it's very disturbing to me, but...
THERAPIST: What you wrote?
CLIENT: What she wrote, yeah. So I'm not going to look at it, but (pause) I'll just let you look at it because it's just (chuckling)... (Pause) [0:13:00] (Exhaling) I thought I'd [stop panicking, but I look at her] (ph) and (chuckling)... (Pause) So... (Pause) So this is what I wrote to her. She'd sent ","P1-N400351":"an earlier e-mail asking, why did you leave?
THERAPIST: Would you be okay reading it to me?
CLIENT: Oh, sorry (chuckling).
THERAPIST: No, that's okay. You don't have to apologize, I was just... it would make more of an impression on me if you read what you wrote.
CLIENT: Okay. And then I won't (ph) read what she wrote because (inaudible at 0:13:34).
THERAPIST: Whatever you'd like.
CLIENT: So I just said, hello. I feel terrible about leaving suddenly, and I really did want to help your mom with her iPad. I feel worse about that because she'd been so kind to me. My time at your place had been sufficiently productive, and I am grateful to you for opening your apartment to me. I ","P1-N400411":"feel I can no longer keep this to myself, so here it is. [0:13:57] Something happened between your father and me which I feel extremely uncomfortable with. It was very inappropriate. After that I did not feel safe or comfortable to stay in his house. Chris had to take an earlier flight and come right ","P1-N400412":"away. I don't... I know I'm burdening (ph) you with this ugliness. But none of it was my fault, and I refuse to take responsibility. All I can do is to distance myself from it, try and forget it happened. I will probably fly back to the US. This is very unfortunate. I'm shaken up. But [here it is as ","P1-N400413":"it] (ph) seems we are not to tell you why I had to leave all of a sudden. You know I hold you in high regard, so I had to say something. You are more than welcome to stay at our place when you come. I will be visiting my mom, so there will be plenty of space. This is to say that there is nothing weird ","P1-N400414":"between Chris and you and me. So... (Pause)
THERAPIST: I see. So that's what you just told her, something about your safety and so...
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I don't know if you want to read this or not, but (chuckling)...
THERAPIST: I'll read whatever you'd like to share with me...
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: Or... yeah, no...
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't want to read it out loud to you.
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: (Chuckling) It's very disturbing to me.
THERAPIST: What's disturbing about it?
CLIENT: Well, if you look at it, you'll know. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Well, yeah, I don't understand. I mean, someone could call you a crazy lunatic. That doesn't necessarily... disturbing. [0:15:57] So what's disturbing to you about it?
CLIENT: I don't know. I feel like she's (inaudible at 0:16:02), bashing me. And I don't like that (chuckling). (Pause) It's like trying to reopen old wounds or, in this case, a wound that is not quite old yet (chuckling), because we, I guess, were friendly. So it hurts to lose a friend. And I know people ","P1-N4005B1":"keep saying, she's a bitch, and she's not worth it. But I still... I didn't think any of that. I still thought that... I wanted her to respect me and like me (chuckling). So that is all. So I'll just put it away (chuckling). (Pause) (Exhaling) [0:16:59] Yeah, so I (inaudible at 0:17:07). (Pause) [0:18:00]
THERAPIST: You chose to stay. That's what's... it's his problem, but you... something was... you chose to stay.
CLIENT: Yeah, and I feel like it was a totally practical concern. Yeah. I mean, I kind of feel like, why should I have to give up something just because of someone else's weirdness? And it wasn't even that actually. So, if I think about it, I guess I chose to ignore it because it was just bizarre, and ","P1-N400631":"I was like, whatever, just... I was more dealing with a... I feel like I've had that kind of interaction before, it seems like, where I'm... and not just with children, but mostly adults actually. [0:24:06] They're like, okay, that's nice. You're being nice. Now don't do that. Keep being nice, and that ","P1-N400632":"is what I want. Just don't say those weird things because, I mean, that was kind of my mode of interaction. You want to interact with someone, right? And they say certain things that bother you, but they're still... overall you think that that person's worth interacting with. So... or it's just the ","P1-N400633":"time, and there's no other option or that there's... you're required to interact with them, for example. So that's kind of what I felt like. [0:24:54] He was always around in the house, and so, if I had to see him, I would be polite and just hope that he wouldn't say weird things, you know (chuckling)? (Pause)
THERAPIST: In your assessment of...?
CLIENT: Well, the situation and the way that I handled it. And everyone that I talked to, they're very supportive, and they're like, yeah, just don't care about her, and she's not a nice person, and none of us liked her anyways (chuckling), and they try to be supportive that way. [0:26:59] Not that ","P1-N400691":"I'm seeking them out to say bad things about her, but just... I guess I feel uncertain, and I just... what I seek is more like approval or confidence, which perhaps should come from inside me and not from other people. And it does come from inside me. I keep... I do hear myself saying that it wasn't... ","P1-N400692":"you couldn't have handled it any differently. You couldn't have moved... you wouldn't have moved away any sooner than you did because you kept giving him the benefit of the doubt. You kept thinking, oh the things that he's saying usually (ph) is weird stuff. And you're not going to be around him. You're ","P1-N400693":"going to try to avoid him.
THERAPIST: You don't want to talk anymore?
CLIENT: Yeah, I'm just... I just want to get away from it. [0:31:58] But talking about it is not the way (chuckling). (Pause) I guess I want to know how someone else would have handled themselves in that situation. I understand that people would have left early, but what if they didn't? What would you do (chuckling)?
THERAPIST: Well, what else do you think they would have done besides left earlier?
CLIENT: If, like me, they chose to ignore those remarks and, like me, they did go downstairs and find themselves alone with the man and he did that to them, what would they do? Would they ignore it or not tell the daughter or...? [0:33:02] (Pause) Did I make it out into a bigger deal than it was, or ","P1-N400751":"(chuckling)...? (Pause) [0:34:00] I guess to me the thing wasn't actually just the physical assault of the... what he did. It was more the meaning of it in the sense that... you know, the construction of that narrative, oh, you don't have any friends, and your mom is depressed, and you have no money ","P1-N400752":"and no family, and... you know? And me trying to negate all that and say, no, this is not true. [0:35:01] That is not true. It's not that bad.
THERAPIST: By the knowledge that people have things you don't have?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, so their grandfather worked hard or inherited more than my grandfather. And so... and similarly with their moms and dads and my mom and dad. I mean, it's all generational and all. [0:40:04] But I feel weakened by that for some reason. And I want to change that. It's very tiring to ","P1-N4007F1":"keep going and looking at everyone's... or thinking about everyone's houses and bank balances (laughing), reducing people I really like to just that and feeling (pause) like I have less or I matter less because of that. Why does that have to be important? I just wish I could... I guess when I feel really ","P1-N4007F2":"insecure I start thinking this way (chuckling). I stay in this pit for a while (chuckling), and it's hard to pull myself out once I start thinking this way, once I start looking at what people have. [0:41:03]
THERAPIST: Well, it makes you envious.
CLIENT: Is it envy? You think it's envy?
THERAPIST: Jealousy?
CLIENT: It's more like fear.
THERAPIST: How?
CLIENT: Of not mattering, of not amounting to much, and of constantly feeling like this (chuckling), and of this being the biggest hindrance in getting anywhere, my own feeling of inadequacy or... (Pause) What I felt after this happened was, if I had family place to stay, this wouldn't have happened. ","P1-N4008B1":"I would be legitimate in that house, and I would be welcome. [0:42:01] (Chuckling) People are like, no, that's not true. Women get... attract unwanted attention anywhere, everywhere, so...
THERAPIST: Yeah, but you know you were there because you didn't have that to go to in your own family.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. What do I do with this goddamn (inaudible at 042:22). (Chuckling) Just... it doesn't go anywhere. It just sits there. I want it to be... either get out of my way so I can do my stuff, or resolve and become something that I can run with or leave or something (chuckling). It ","P1-N4008F1":"just has not shifted, changed. I just feel like pushing everyone away when I think this way, because everyone I tell it to, I'm thinking, oh, what kind of place do they have in Nepal, like (inaudible at 0:42:55)? [0:42:57] Do they have a place (chuckling)? And that makes me mad. It makes me want to ","P1-N4008F2":"do a lot of crazy things (laughing). But ultimately it only harms me, so...
THERAPIST: Like what?
CLIENT: Well, pushing people away and (pause) pushing things away that I care about and being destructive emotionally and... yeah. (Pause) I just want to find someone like myself, someone in my economic condition or someone who's had a disastrous past like me (laughing), you know? [0:44:00] And there ","P1-N400931":"just doesn't seem to be anyone like that. So... and it's funny because I'm saying this because... I mean, I'm really insane, because there are so many people much worse off than me everywhere. (Pause) I just am not part of their circle and their world, but they're out there. So...
THERAPIST: You don't seek them out.
CLIENT: Yeah. I should, shouldn't I?
THERAPIST: I don't know what you should do (chuckling).
CLIENT: (Laughing)
THERAPIST: That was more of a statement of fact.
CLIENT: Yeah. I seek out stable people, right? And then they become brick walls, and I can just smash my head against them (laughing). I don't know. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Why do you think you need to smash your head? [0:44:59]
CLIENT: Because I feel angry and... yeah. (Pause) (Exhaling) Oh well, anger is not productive. I mean it can be, but... (Pause)
THERAPIST: Cecelia (sp?), we need to stop for today, okay?
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I will see you on Monday.
CLIENT: All right. 10:15 is it?
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Yes. Very good.
CLIENT: Have a good weekend.
THERAPIST: Take care. Thank you.
