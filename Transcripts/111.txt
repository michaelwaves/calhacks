TITLE: Client "C" Therapy Session Audio Recording, October 05, 2012: Client is burdened by her mother's living and working situation and struggles to fix her mother's issues while attempting to fix her own.
DESCRIPTION: Client is burdened by her mother's living and working situation and struggles to fix her mother's issues while attempting to fix her own.
THERAPIST: Good morning! Come on in. (pause) So, I haven't worked with that insurance before, but I've worked with it from other schools, and it's usually very good. They are actually usually quite reliable.
CLIENT: Uh-huh.
THERAPIST: And you're not going to have a session limit, because session limits are for some diagnoses and not for others. I'm just diagnosing you with dysthymia, which is kind of like a low-grade depression, and there is no session limits for that.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So, I think your insurance will be quite good and then, as I said, with the tape recordings, I could just charge you $10 a session. [00:01:10]
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Does that sound good?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Also, once we figure out, I can just sort of... because you paid me then too much, so I'll reimburse you the money, okay?
CLIENT: Okay. (pause) So good finally to get stuff done! (chuckles). I feel like I finally have time to take care of stuff that's been lying around for months now. (chuckles).
THERAPIST: Lethal is pretty bad.
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: Lethal is pretty bad!
CLIENT: (chuckles) It's caustic! I just feel like (becoming into a puddle ph?) and just disappearing! I really cannot see her, or even hear her when she's like that. I don't' know...
THERAPIST: It sounds like her losing her job and crashing her car was very convenient for her.
CLIENT: Well, don't be harsh on her! (laughs) I mean, I don't think she planned to do that, I mean, I think she would have liked to, you know, be responsible. [00:15:05]
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: I think she wants to be responsible. I mean, I just assume that people, and her specifically, she does want to be, like... She doesn't want to burden me, and I think she said, I mean she says that, you know?
THERAPIST: So, I mean, do you feel she's incompetent, then? I mean, either she wants to burden you or she's incompetent.
CLIENT: Well, people are at all levels. I mean, I could be incompetent, too, you know? Like... Yeah, I mean, none of us is perfect, right? (chuckles) Yeah, I mean...
THERAPIST: But you're competent to take care of yourself, and you're saying she isn't.
CLIENT: Yeah... I mean, I wonder, like, how much of it is, you know, like, being in a new country when you're, you know, older versus your... I don't know if it's something psychological or what it is, really. [00:16:04]
THERAPIST: Like your friend's mother?
CLIENT: Well, they're so different, though, right? I mean, I know, maybe it's not fair to compare the friend's mom with my mom, you know? I was completely like... she's so strong, she's so strong-willed. I mean, I think it's almost to a, her fault, that she's so strong-willed. But yeah, I mean, she's ","P1-N4005D1":"never a figure of pathos. She's like, she's just so strong and she's older than my mom and she's quite worn down because of this kind of a job, you know? Like, she's had knee replacement surgeries, and this and that, and like her feet ache all the time, and she has diabetes; but she lives on her own, ","P1-N4005D2":"like every morning, you know, she makes her coffee and she's out the door, you know?
THERAPIST: Are you talking about vic... Well, how would it be useful? What would it be useful for?
CLIENT: Well, I was thinking like more like politically and historically. Like, you know, if you have, like, had something, say, (this is something that I'm working on in my novel), like, the partition, where you know, like, millions of people got displaced. So they can have a narrative that... Yeah, ","P1-N400631":"they were wronged by history and by their leaders, and by their neighbors. So, it's fine to say that, you know, we were wronged; don't do this sort of thing again, you know? Don't split a country like this (chuckles). But after that, I don't know, like on an individual level, how useful that narrative ","P1-N400632":"is, you know? [00:18:35]
THERAPIST: What is your theory about your mother's difficulties?
CLIENT: Well, partly that she's an invalid and she came here at a later date, at a later age, so it's because of that that she finds things difficult. But then, that's not true because she does, she had to conquer so many things. She has... like in Ohio. So, I had no time, you know? I basically, like, ","P1-N400691":"provided. It was the rent and, you know, I was there living with her, but... She figured out all the bus routes, and she would, you know, go everywhere on her own on the bus, on the train. She figured that out herself. [00:20:10]
THERAPIST: Yeah. So what do you think it is?
CLIENT: I don't know. (chuckles) (pause 00:20:48 to 00:21:10) I mean, is it just me, who's like, "Oh, I wish my mother was, I don't know... Lady Diana and she turns out to be (chuckles) the pauper from (chuckles) I don't know... I don't think it's that. Do I have very high standards for her and she's... ","P1-N4006F1":"(sniffs) and she fails them or... what do I do? (pause)
THERAPIST: This is a rather odd question, but it came to my mind. Would you want to marry someone like her?
CLIENT: That's a very odd question! (laughs)
THERAPIST: It's an odd question. Well, it's an odd question because, I guess, it speaks to... what you value, or don't value.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I'll have to think about this, because, I should say I... It's not that I haven't thought in those terms, in the sense that marrying my mother, being married to my mother... I mean, I already said, you know, soul mate, so... we are in that realm (chuckles). I shouldn't say this, ","P1-N400771":"you're probably going to think I'm absolutely crazy, but you probably hear (chuckles) crazy stuff all the time (laughs). But, I've had this weird kind of, I don't know what you call it, complex? I don't know if you could supply the word. [00:22:53]
THERAPIST: I'm trying to underst... I mean, I think I understand the distinction.
CLIENT: Yeah. I think that was your question, though, do I value her.
THERAPIST: Yeah, the qualities or attributes or behavior you see in her, those things that you value in someone.
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, like I said, I probably I derive some gratification from it, but I don't think it's a basis for, I should say, it should not be the basis. (phone rings) [00:27:07]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean I guess maybe a different way of asking the question is, why does she take such poor care of herself; does she not know any better or does she not try?
CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) Yeah, my dad had the same complaint. (chuckles) I mean, she's probably a little psychologically damaged, too, because of her own life and baggage and what not, but... Yeah, it's rare that she dresses up nicely and it's even more rare or probably never that she cleans up ","P1-N400911":"the house, cleans up her surroundings and her room and stuff. (pause 00:29:27 to 00:29:51)
THERAPIST: (A lot of people ph?) feel really good to feel bad for yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah?
THERAPIST: Feel like the victim.
CLIENT: Yeah? Are you saying that's... people do that or...? Yeah. But it's so debilitating, isn't it?
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: It's good to feel debilitated?
THERAPIST: I don't know if it's good! (chuckles)
CLIENT: (chuckles) I mean, I do see that because I used to be someone who would say, "It's fun to be sad," you know? Like, it's a kind of liquor, you know? It's kind of a drug to feel, to kind of cultivate that mentality of sadness, you know. It's very dangerous. I mean, if it's for some creative purpose, ","P1-N400A51":"I mean, like, you know, lots of poets and writers, they cultivate that over-sensitivity to sadness, you know, to sorrow. You can fall off the edge and really, you know, dive into that well of sorrow, then you will not be able to get out, or do anything. [00:33:13]
THERAPIST: Do you think your mother is bitter about her life?
CLIENT: Oh yeah! Yeah, I mean, I think we've discussed this, like, she doesn't... her and I have always been, like, like (why did I get ph?) married and give up my bright future in, I don't know, science (chuckles). [00:34:13]
THERAPIST: Well, I think bitterness always comes... you know, breeds anger, don't you think?
CLIENT: Yeah, but she's like the most un-angry person I know, like, completely like a... very passive. She has absolutely no desires, absolut... she probably does, but you know, like, I'd be like, "What do you want to do?" (high-pitched voice) "I don't know... Whatever you want..." (regular voice) "Where ","P1-N400AF1":"do you want to go eat?" (high-pitched voice) "I don't' know..." (chuckles) She has that tone, like, (air attitude ph?). But she has no, like, nothing... she does not articulate desires the way I want her to, you know... in the simplest of things. [00:35:12]
THERAPIST: What might you be scared of?
CLIENT: (pause) Of being abandoned myself! (laughs) I guess. She's not the only one who can feel abandoned, you know.
THERAPIST: Would you feel abandoned by her, or would you identify with her feeling of being abandoned?
CLIENT: It's too complicated! (laughs) Yeah, like, if she didn't need me, I'm sure there have been tons of instances where she, you know, might say, "Oh, I can go to this place by myself," and I'm like, "No, I'll drop you." Whatever. So that would make me feel, I guess... well, it makes me feel relieved. ","P1-N400B91":"You know, it makes you feel, like, "Okay, that's one duty that I don't have to do," you know. I can sleep an hour extra, or I can, you know, read for another hour, work for another hour; that's there. [00:38:15]
THERAPIST: I don't know; I mean I guess one way to think about is, has she abandoned her role as your mother?
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, she had to mother my father, so... (chuckles)
THERAPIST: It didn't sound like she was such a good mother to your father.
CLIENT: Really?
THERAPIST: Well, you described your father as feeling like nothing was taken care of.
CLIENT: Yeah, but then again, that could have been because of the back and forth, you know, like... [00:41:10]
THERAPIST: Yeah, no, I'm not saying no, but it doesn't sound like she... it didn't sound like her mothering at least went very far with him.
CLIENT: Yeah, but what she would say, you know, I had to, no matter when he woke up, I had to be up before him and make sure the breakfast was ready, or something like that, so... I mean, she's always, you know, constantly cooking for him, for me, you know. I don't know...
THERAPIST: Feels more like she was his mother and not his wife? I mean, wives cook for, especially, I imagine in their generation, wives cooked for their husbands all the time.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. But then, you know, he didn't work at all most of their marriage and she provided for both of... well, for him, for both of them, so that's not really a wife's job. I don't know. (chuckles) [00:42:07]
THERAPIST: It's interesting that you associate it with a mother's job.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So mother is supposed to work and provide?
CLIENT: Well, like in my case, the father didn't do anything that a father is supposed to do. That's when I feel abandoned, you know? Really, when I look at...
THERAPIST: ...him?
CLIENT: ...I cannot watch men with their little girls. It makes me really get very upset. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: What upsets you?
CLIENT: Well, just you know, like, I didn't... I had a dad and he didn't do any of those things, you know? That makes me, I really, I tear up (as in cry) or I just get up and walk away. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I would imagine that you're walking away a lot, because there are a lot of dads with their daughters (client chuckles) that I see, at least.
CLIENT: Well thankfully I don't! (laughs) I don't try to see... to avoid seeing that, so...
THERAPIST: That makes you sad?
CLIENT: Yeah. It makes me bitter and angry... [00:43:20]
THERAPIST: So it makes you think about what you didn't get?
CLIENT: Yeah. Because I see how beautiful that is, you know? Like... but, whatever... (chuckles)
THERAPIST: That's hard to think about.
CLIENT: Yeah... (chuckles) (pause) I try to compensate for a dad. I think boyfriends were, you know, father figures. (laughs)
THERAPIST: There is a lot of confusion about the difference between a spouse or boyfriend and a parent. Like, is your mother your mother or your spouse? Is your mother your father's mother or his spouse or just (at one point ph? 00:44:20)? Is your boyfriend your boyfriend or your father? Like there ","P1-N400F31":"is a lot of mixing up of that.
CLIENT: Yeah, there is. (chuckles) A big (puddle ph?), a big mess. [00:44:30]
THERAPIST: The roles are not clear. Everyone's roles are muddled. Are you your mother's daughter or are you her mother?
CLIENT: Well, she introduces me as her mother to a lot of people. (laughs)
THERAPIST: She does? She introduces you as her mother?
CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Wow! What is that like when she does that?
CLIENT: I feel really... everyone laughs. (laughs)
THERAPIST: What do you think? Is it funny?
CLIENT: It's funny and it's... what is the word? Absurd and...
THERAPIST: ...and truthful?
CLIENT: Yeah (chuckles). Yeah. (pause) [00:45:10]
THERAPIST: It's interesting, because the few times, at least today, where I've asked a question, or you've even commented on your own thoughts, you said, "It's too complicated." And I think you have a wonderful mind, so, how can it be too complicated? But maybe this is why; because there are a lot of ","P1-N4010B1":"complicated, confusing things.
CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) I don't know why you said I have a wonderful mind; I definitely have a mind that keeps churning and keeps thinking too much about everything, so that's probably why it's complicated.
THERAPIST: Well, you have a mind that has a lot on it.
CLIENT: (laughs) Burdened might be a better word!
THERAPIST: It's very burdened, but that doesn't mean it's not wonderful.
CLIENT: (laughs) Well, I want to, like, sort things out slowly and make sure that I don't feel things are too complicated to even think about them and not have a resolution. This is, like, you know, really helping me in the sense that I used to be in therapy, like, right after I graduated; but that ","P1-N401151":"didn't help at all because... I don't really know what her title was, well, she never said anything; like absolutely nothing. And I saw her for like a year (laughs). [00:46:39]
THERAPIST: Really?
CLIENT: Yes!
THERAPIST: That's a long time! To see someone who's not very useful.
CLIENT: Yeah, and I guess I didn't know any better at that time, so... And it's funny; I feel like I made a lot of progress here because... I was surprised because last time I was here, I was like, "There is a difference between being sad and being depressed." I would not have been able to articulate ","P1-N4011D1":"even that, at that time. (chuckles) Which is weird, because you would think that, well, that's obvious!
THERAPIST: It's not that obvious, actually.
CLIENT: Yeah? [00:47:12]
THERAPIST: I don't think so.
CLIENT: Well, it took me a long time to say that I don't want to be depressed, because earlier I'd be like, Well I guess if I want to follow my passion, then that's just my lot. (chuckles) After a lot of, you know, years of struggling, I realized there is no way that, you know, I can produce anything (chuckles)...
THERAPIST: Being depressed does not facilitate creativity.
CLIENT: No, it does not.
THERAPIST: Being sad sometimes probably does.
CLIENT: It does, but then you know, again, sadness you get over.
THERAPIST: Yeah, hopefully not too much sadness. You know, (Cecelia sp?), we really need to stop for today. So let's find... it sounds like... I'm really delighted that... I'm just getting my schedule. I'm really delighted that all the insurance stuff works out and it's going to be affordable for you. ","P1-N4012F1":"That's great. [00:48:04]
CLIENT: Yeah, thank you so much for (chuckles)...
THERAPIST: Oh, it's my pleasure; I'm glad to know that. So why don't, you know, I really, since we're going to go ahead with the twice a week, I'd like to get us sort of a regular time so that I know you have it, well we both know you have it. How's that?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: So let me see... So, right now, on Monday, this Monday we have 10:15, but otherwise we have a regular time at 11:00; is that correct? (client affirms) Okay. I know you prefer a little earlier, so if the 10:15 does become available, I'll certainly let you know. (client affirms) And then when ","P1-N401371":"else? So, I have Wednesday, mornings or afternoons better, or does it really matter?
CLIENT: Mornings.
THERAPIST: Okay, so Wednesday... I have... Wednesday I have a few options. I have a 9:00 on Wednesday mornings and I should also have a 10:40, although I think the 9:00 looks better. (client affirms) Do you want to do 9:00? (client affirms) I messed something up, though... Okay, I'd better just change this...
CLIENT: So, next Wednesday at 9:00 won't work?
THERAPIST: Yeah. Just next week. After that, Wednesdays will be just fine. (client affirms) But next Wednesday, I could do a 10:40 in the morning; would that work?
CLIENT: Um, can you do Thursday or Friday?
THERAPIST: Let me take a look. Um, that's the 11th. Okay, I don't have anything in the morning, but I do have something in the afternoon.
CLIENT: How about the 12th? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Um... what are you... so Wednesday doesn't work at 10:40?
CLIENT: Um, I could make it work, but, if, not if, if you don't have anything on the 12th? [00:50:08]
THERAPIST: Well... oh, the 12th, I see. Um, I could, but it would be later in the afternoon. (client affirms) I would have, like... let's see... I could do a 3:00 on Friday the 12th. Do you want to do that?
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: Okay. That's better than the Wednesday time?
CLIENT: Um, yeah. I could finish up early that day or something. (chuckles) (pause) So 3:00?
THERAPIST: So 3:00 on Friday. So, next week is a little different. Monday at 10:15, Friday at 3:00 and then after that, Monday at 11:00 and Wednesday at 9:00. Sound good? (client affirms) Okay, great! Okay, and I will figure out the reimbursement, so I'll... It's like, you paid for five sessions that ","P1-N401551":"your insurance is reimbursing for, so I'll make sure to figure out the reimbursement to you.
CLIENT: Sure, no problem!
THERAPIST: Okay, take care, (Cecelia sp?). Okay, bye-bye!
CLIENT: You, too! Bye. I hope you got your parking permit!
THERAPIST: Oh, yeah! God, that's right! That was a mess! Okay! Take care.
