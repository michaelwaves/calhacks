DESCRIPTION: Client is exhausted and frustrated by her mother's actions towards her. Client discusses her mother's issues and how it has a negative impact on her life.
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in.
CLIENT: So, I wanted to read you this text message that my mom sent me. She sent it on Monday and it just, I sent it to my best friend and I forwarded it to my boyfriend and they were both like really. So, I just wanted to read it to you so it maybe it gives you a little better perspective of what my ","P1-N4000D1":"mom is like. [00:01:00]
THERAPIST: A year and a half?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Wow. I didn't realize it was that long.
CLIENT: Yeah. So, she kicked me out in January and then maybe it was longer than that. I moved back in and I only lived there for maybe a month and then she didn't really start talking to me again until I moved here, so maybe. Yeah, I guess it was about a year and a half. So, maybe it was two years ","P1-N4001D1":"or two and a half years? So, she doesn't seem like she has such an issue with it and she just does, you know, and I guess she acts upset and then she talks about me behind my back and continues to do that. I can only imagine what she's saying now. [00:06:25]
THERAPIST: What were you looking for from your boyfriend and your friend in showing them the text message?
CLIENT: I just, I guess was kind of. I don't know if I was really looking for them to really say anything. It was more so just, you know, like and yet again, just another showing because, you know, they both sort of understand how my mom is I'm like, you know, and now it's just sort of like yet again ","P1-N400291":"here my mom goes with her text messaging and all of her other things that she says and, you know, of course they were like just she's why? You know. It just makes my boyfriend angry. [00:10:30]
THERAPIST: Do you think you are looking for validation from your boyfriend and your friend? [00:12:50]
CLIENT: A little bit. In just like I did ask my best friend like am I reading this wrong? Is she trying to be nice? Did I say anything wrong to her? You know, she, she's very; my best friend is very forward with me. She doesn't just say oh no, everything's fine. If she thought that I had said anything ","P1-N400331":"wrong or did anything wrong she'd be like no, you should probably apologize, but she said I don't think you did anything wrong. I'm pretty sure your mom is doing what she usually does. You know, expecting you to come groveling back to her. You know, my mom I think she just, sometimes she wants to make ","P1-N400332":"sure that I still need her and then when I sort of display that I actually don't, it makes her mad and so then she just, she won't talk to me and I basically have to, you know, do the apologizing and somehow make her think that I need her and then she feels better. [00:14:00]
THERAPIST: For the two of you or for you?
CLIENT: I guess so for me. Right now I've, you know, I don't, I don't want to say that I don't care, but I need to sort of focus on my life and my feelings and how I feel and getting myself to the point where I don't feel like she's constantly badgering me and I don't feel like I'm constantly, you know, ","P1-N400391":"living to make sure that I don't say anything wrong to upset her so that she doesn't feel that I'm being disrespectful to her or anything like that. Like, I don't want to have to tiptoe around her. You know, if at some point I feel like maybe I want to talk to her or maybe I want to say something to ","P1-N400392":"her I will, but I'm not going to apologize to her for the things I'm not doing. If she wants to talk to me, that's fine, but I know she won't. That's just how she is. She'll go and it doesn't, it won't matter. So, I just don't think I'm in the right frame of mind at the moment to be able to talk to ","P1-N400393":"her and say what I want to say, I guess, which is frustrating. [00:17:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah. Would you like to be able to?
CLIENT: I would like to be able to, but, you know, I think I've always just, I've always known that okay, this is how she is. She's never going to change. I've always had hope that maybe she would or maybe at some point in time like something will happen and it will change, but she's just really not ","P1-N4003D1":"and what had happened, you know, what's going on right now and everything that is happening is a big deal to me and to my boyfriend and, you know, everything else. It may not be a big deal to anybody else, but it is to us because it's happening to us. Every person has been supportive. I mean I haven't ","P1-N4003D2":"told, you know, like my family or anything like that just because I don't really want to get them involved. It's not really any of their business. You know, like my best friend and the people that I work for have been really supportive. The other family that I sometimes work for and, you know, I hang ","P1-N4003D3":"out with them, you know, on a friendly basis have been supportive and my mom has not and I don't. I don't know. I guess I don't really feel like I don't really even need her and she's just, no one else is really making it about them. Everyone else is just, you know, lending an ear and saying, you know, ","P1-N4003D4":"we'll do what we can do for you and if you need a break, just ask and whatever else. [00:18:50]
THERAPIST: What was it like for you the last time?
CLIENT: When she kicked me out?
THERAPIST: Yeah. When you didn't speak. When you were not speaking.
CLIENT: It really, it wasn't that bad. I mean in the beginning it was kind of like, I think, I'm trying to think. I don't know if I have ever really gotten upset that I don't talk to her. It's more the frustration of the fact that she's being so dramatic and she, you know, is continuing to just, I feel ","P1-N400491":"like everybody is out to get her and everybody hates her and, you know, it's frustrating when you have someone that is constantly saying that. [00:21:45]
THERAPIST: It sounds like she identifies with your dog about being abandoned. Not being cared for. Somehow like she identifies with it.
CLIENT: I guess. I have no idea, but she just... It's very frustrating and you know and I've said to her, you know, like, she's my dog and I will do what I need to do with her as I see fit and you know when I was working outside of the house, you know, sixty hours a week or more, she stayed at home ","P1-N400551":"all day while I was at work and she was fine and you know she's on my case if I have to leave her for a few hours. So, I just don't, I have resigned to the idea of just not telling her, you know, like what happened. It's like the dog ate chicken bones this past weekend and I called the vet or whatever. ","P1-N400552":"Then my first thought was if I told my mom about this she would absolutely be freaking out. She would be yelling at me and how could I let the dog eat the trash like it was my fault. You need to take her to the vet and you need to go get her stomach pumped or something like completely over reactive. [00:26:40]
THERAPIST: It doesn't sound like it.
CLIENT: No. I just feel like there's something. It's always something. Like, my grandmother isn't talking to her or someone at school said something or so and so is, you know, being this way or that way and I don't know. She's just, I try to imagine like what her life, like, what goes on inside her ","P1-N400611":"head and I couldn't even begin to kind of form any sort of coherent thoughts about it because she's just all over the place and for someone to just be totally fine and okay with not talking to their only child and going a long span without talking to me and talking behind my back and all this other ","P1-N400612":"stuff is just, to me, it's just so silly. [00:32:20]
THERAPIST: And sad.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it's just, it's almost like it's more sad for her and less sad for me. Just that she constantly has all of these feelings inside and she's not honest with anybody and she doesn't, you know, when she goes to her own therapist I know she's not saying anything, not anything, but most ","P1-N400651":"of it can't possibly be true because she will tell me some of the conversations that she has and I'm just like really. I mean you talked about that? You know, or are you sure? You know, I'm thinking in my head like that's not remotely true what you're saying to him, so he has no idea and I just I'm ","P1-N400652":"starting to just sort of just feel sad for her because she's alienating herself from everybody in my entire family and she doesn't like her boyfriend's family. They're all, there's something wrong with all of them and my grand mom is this way and my aunts are that way and her own daughter apparently ","P1-N400653":"doesn't do anything for her. [00:33:40]
THERAPIST: That this is the situation.
CLIENT: That this is just how it is and I have no other choice. I can't change the way that she is. She's not ever going to change and I just have to sort of accept that and if that's, you know, what I have to do then I guess that's what I have to do. You know, it could change later, but right now, ","P1-N400731":"that's just sort of how it has to be and it sucks and I don't really, you know, I wouldn't want people to, I don't know. I don't want people to feel bad for me because to me it's like well, I'm losing so much drama and so much unnecessary baggage by not necessarily having the relationship with her as ","P1-N400732":"other people would have with their mom. Whereas, if I decide to have a relationship with her, then it just adds a whole new element of dramatics in to my life that I don't really want or need at this point . [00:40:30]
THERAPIST: It's complicated to lose something that you never really felt you had to begin with.
CLIENT: Yeah. And, trying to like make sense of it all and I think this is the first time I've like sort of actually verbalized a lot of it and, you know, just still now having to sort of think about it and actually have it, you know, sort of like become real as time goes on and, you know, not talking ","P1-N400791":"to her and just swallowing it and like realizing that I'm not losing someone who has been caring and supportive. It's been more someone who has been filled with drama and trying to control my life to where she wants it to be. So, it's essentially more weight off my shoulders than not. Whereas, most ","P1-N400792":"people would look at it the opposite way because I guess not everybody has normal moms. [00:42:40]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I guess I just need to sort of swallow that and think about that, but right now, that's sort of on the back burner given that I just need to get through tomorrow and figure out what's going to happen there and that's it. I think that's it.
THERAPIST: Do you feel like you're slightly less anxious about it now? Tomorrow?
CLIENT: Tomorrow? No. I think I'm, well, in talking to lawyer he basically said look, he's, he's going to get arraigned tomorrow because the DAjust doesn't really want to talk to anybody, but now it's sort of just a matter of getting the charges dropped from here. [00:43:45]
THERAPIST: Is he required to do so?
CLIENT: Yes. So, after he gets officially arraigned tomorrow on the charges, he has to tell them just because he's up for in 2014 they do different boards for his security clearance and he has top secret security clearance and so it could affect that and if they do a background check on him then and ","P1-N400891":"he never told them then it sort of raises more eyebrows like you had this happen, but you never told us and I think he's more worried because he is an officer. So, and he's working at headquarters doing a much more important job that he recently got. So, he feels like he has a lot more to lose and he's ","P1-N400892":"sort of nervous about that. [00:45:00]
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you're having the same attitude towards both which is sort of resigned this is what the reality is. You know. There are certain things you can control and there are certain things you can't and with both these situations you can't control them. [00:46:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. And, I'm usually fairly, you know, I always need to control things and I always need to sort of, I have a little bit of that in my mom. Like, I'm a planner and I like to know what's going to happen, but, you know, the lawyers have just been like you've got to let go. Like, there's nothing ","P1-N4008F1":"you can do about it. Like, you can't go in there and change anything and, you know, I've just kind of come to the okay, well, we'll just get through this and then we'll move on and we'll get to the next point and that's sort of basically how I feel about my mom. Like, I'll just make the decision of ","P1-N4008F2":"how I'm going to be now. It can change later if it needs to, but, you know, it's not set in stone necessarily, but at the same time, like, you can't do anything. She's not going to change and I'm not going to keep hoping that she does. So. Yeah.
THERAPIST: We're going to need to stop for today.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So, right now we'll leave that appointment on Thursday since we don't have Monday.
CLIENT: Yeah. That works because you have something to do on Monday.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I know my schedule will probably be a little crazy, so instead of having to like juggle a new thing, I will just come on next Thursday.
THERAPIST: If for any reason, you know, given what tomorrow brings up a lot of feelings and you feel you want to come in earlier, just let me know.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Otherwise I will see you on Thursday.
CLIENT: Okay, great.
THERAPIST: Okay?
CLIENT: Thank you very much.
THERAPIST: Sure. I will see you then. Good luck tomorrow, okay.
CLIENT: Yeah. Thank you.
THERAPIST: Take care.
