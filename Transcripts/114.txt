DESCRIPTION: Client discusses his frustrations at his current job, for he feels as if he cannot communicate correctly. Client discusses how he was never punished as a child and now gets angry when people say no or don't let him do things he wants to.
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in. I'm just going to grab some water. (pause) I wanted to ask you about a scheduling thing real quick.
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: So I teach a course on Tuesdays starting... I think it'll be sometime at the end of November.
CLIENT: OK.
THERAPIST: From 3:00 to 4:30.
CLIENT: OK.
THERAPIST: It's a ten week course. I'm sorry I didn't tell you about this before.
CLIENT: That's all right.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:00:45) in the future. So... and it's a ten week course. So I was hoping during that time we could find something so that obviously we can...
CLIENT: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday doesn't work for me...
THERAPIST: OK.
CLIENT: ...because I have soccer.
THERAPIST: OK. Well, one thing I could do is meet after class on Tuesday. Would that work? [00:01:03]
CLIENT: That would work, yea.
THERAPIST: OK. Let me double check that but I think I could because I'm in Concord probably I could do 5 o'clock.
CLIENT: Yea, 5:00 or 6:00 or whatever. If you want to grab dinner, I could even do later. It's up to you.
THERAPIST: Let me take a look. I think 5:00 would probably work a little bit better.
CLIENT: OK. Yea, whatever is convenient for you. I can... I'm pretty flexible because Tuesdays are my days off.
THERAPIST: Oh OK, great.
CLIENT: So...
THERAPIST: Would you be able to... oh, Tuesdays are your day from soccer.
CLIENT: Yea.
THERAPIST: So you wouldn't be able to come before the class. Would that be a possibility?
CLIENT: I get out at work at 3:00.
THERAPIST: Right, I thought it was. So it's your day off from soccer, not from work.
CLIENT: Yea. Not from work.
THERAPIST: So yea, let me take a look. But I think 5:00... and let me figure... also find out. I don't know... it's the last week in November. I don't know when it starts. Probably...
CLIENT: Yea, that's fine.
THERAPIST: OK, great.
CLIENT: Just let me know. I'm pretty flexible on Tuesdays. I mean, if we had to do, there's some Fridays I could do.
THERAPIST: OK.
CLIENT: But...
THERAPIST: I think the Tuesday will work. I just want to...
CLIENT: OK.
THERAPIST: And again, it's ten weeks.
CLIENT: OK, that's fine. [00:02:01] Yea, everything is going OK. I'm just starting to feel irritated at my job because for what I went to school for and for what the position I thought it was going to be, it's kind of not what I thought it would be. I thought I'd actually be doing more hands on helping ","P1-N400511":"kids. Helping them with their learning disabilities and actually helping them out. And it turns out I'm more like a babysitter. And I'm just getting frustrated because the whole school all my coworkers all we complain about is our students and how... like today we had school but all... so all the ","P1-N400512":"students come from all over the state. And the parents that send their kids to school today, the whole staff was saying they only did that so they can have a babysitter for their kids so they can have a day off. [00:03:01]
THERAPIST: From?
CLIENT: From people. Like the feedback that I'm getting is not, "This is what you need to do. This is the approach you need to take." It's just, "Stop doing this. Stop doing that. You can do this, but you can't do that." And I'm like, "All right. Well, can I add anything?" "No, just do this." And that ","P1-N400671":"irritates me because I'm thinking to myself, well, if I can't do this and I can't do that but I can only do this, then what actually is getting accomplished here? Is... I guess what I'm looking for is a hint or a strategy of how I can solve a problem in a different way. [00:13:11]
THERAPIST: What do you think is lacking?
CLIENT: The delivery. The emotion is there, but it's my emotion of what I want. [00:14:06] I think the empathy part is lacking in the deliveries. Because everything I do if I'm frustrated with them, my voice gets harder and more attacking. If I don't care about it, it's soft and I'm just... I don't ","P1-N4006D1":"pay attention and I just... I slowly doze out and my voice is like this. It's normal. But when I really am enthusiastic about something, I'll make eye contact. I'll focus. I'll talk in a regular tone of voice. And I'll be interested in the conversation. And that's for all conversations. However, I catch ","P1-N4006D2":"myself a lot when I'm not interested. I'll look over there. I'll forget what they're saying. I'll zone people out. And for me, it's rude because the most important part of being able to relate to someone or to get what you want is to be an effective communicator. [00:15:14]
THERAPIST: What was sort of threatening about them coming up to you?
CLIENT: Just that they were different. I didn't know them. [00:20:04] And just like a trust issue. I didn't know... didn't want to say too much. I didn't want... I was very hesitant because it was just a new person and I didn't know them and I didn't know what... I kind of feel like I didn't really ","P1-N4007B1":"engage in like the social aspect of situations because as I got older, I've become more and more social. I've felt more and more comfortable talking to people. I mean, when I do presentations I don't... and here's the thing that's weird about me is I don't mind getting up in front of 300 people and ","P1-N4007B2":"making a presentation. However, if you put me at a table with eight people and I have to talk with them, I'm very uncomfortable. And for me, I just don't understand why that is. [00:21:01]
THERAPIST: Well, here's one thought I had was especially when you were describing talking to your students that it seems like you have a hard time feeling confident in your authority. [00:24:11]
CLIENT: I do. I do. I feel like I have no authority because everything that I have done before... like put it this way. When we were... when I was coaching, I was never the head coach. I never made decisions. When I did, when I was a head coach, I made those decisions. But everywhere I've gone, I've ","P1-N400851":"always been the underman. So I've made threats, but every time I made threats, the head coach would always cut my head off. It's just a figure of speech. Just cut my head off and I felt like I had no authority.
THERAPIST: Well, in a sense what you're describing is that your parents didn't have confidence in their authority. I mean, they... when you have confidence in your authority, you, over time, realize that you can have some influence even if that influence...
CLIENT: Yea, yea.
THERAPIST: But they didn't feel confident about that. So the way they got influence over you is by bribing you.
CLIENT: Yea. No, that's truly how I feel because there are times where I wish I was grounded. There are times I wish like I had shit taken away from me. Because now I'm actually getting shit taken away from me with my fiancï¿½. She goes, "You can't have this." [00:27:59] And I cry like a little ","P1-N400931":"kid trying to get it. I do. And I'm not going to lie. I cry like a little kid. And she stays firm on it and I don't get it and I'm over it. I get over it and I move on.
THERAPIST: Well, you feel frustrated because your actions don't seem to have immediate results which is true, especially if they're getting other messages at home. But as you understand for yourself being on the other end that over time, they can feel extremely thankful and grateful even if it's not ","P1-N400991":"what they want to hear in the moment. [00:30:12] But I think that when they say no or they don't listen to you, it already sort of feeds into your own lack of confidence in your authority. And it's hard for you to toe the line.
CLIENT: Well, it is because that's when the frustration gets... kicks in is when I say something, I feel like they're not listening like I was. And then I just trigger something, like with me, like they're all just like, "Yea, he's full of crap because no matter what, I'm going to get what I want." ","P1-N4009B1":"That's how I was when I was younger. I used to be like, "Oh, all right. I'll give it an hour and then I'll try again." And then I did and then boom, I'd get it. It's kind of like that mixed message where even now I can do something for this long. If it's at the end of the day, they're like, "Oh, whatever. ","P1-N4009B2":"I'll suck it up because in an hour I'm going to get to play it anyway." [00:31:03]
THERAPIST: Well, my first thought is that if the skills to survive were... came easy to them, they wouldn't need your help.
CLIENT: No, I know.
THERAPIST: And I can totally appreciate how you feel. Not only are you not getting support, but you may... they may be getting counter... you may have forces that are or their parents counter to what you're trying to do which is very frustrating.
CLIENT: Well, it's frustrating because the goals we set out for them, their parents agreed on. That's where I get frustrated is because we set up a sheet that their moms and dads told us that they wanted their kids to work on. [00:33:09] Not exactly what we put on the sheet but the skills that they ","P1-N400A71":"wanted developed the more social interactions on campus, the more of keeping in touch with what else is going on around campus. Those are goals that meetings with mom and dad and us those are what mom and dad wanted to focus on because moving forward, a lot of their kids are going to be leaving ","P1-N400A72":"our school. And having to go into a college whether it is a community college or a four year full-time college and mom and dad are just nervous about releasing them into the college life without any general skills or any general knowledge of what to expect because ultimately they're not going to ","P1-N400A73":"have one of us driving them to college. [00:34:01]
THERAPIST: Well, what you described at the beginning in terms of saying, well, we're all babysitters or sharing (ph), that's having other people say that, too. I think babysitters have an important job but it's a feeling of being devalued.
CLIENT: Yea. I do. I feel like that. Again, I feel like that. I just am irritated at what I was reading about and what was talked about of the opportunity. And when I first read about it and heard about it, I was extremely ecstatic. Because I thought, oh, this is awesome one on one in the classroom, ","P1-N400B11":"going to actually work with kids that have autism. [00:38:07] That in my head, completely delusional, thought that they'd be functioning like normal high school kids.
THERAPIST: Why? Why did you think that?
CLIENT: Because my two little cousins have Asperger's. They're fairly bright. They function like normal high schoolers. That's the thought I had in my head. And I get to school, totally different, absolutely different. Kids are much worse than my cousins. Their social skills just aren't there. And it's ","P1-N400B51":"totally what I didn't expect. And I guess shame on me for expecting them all to be like my cousins. Being able to socialize and talk and not have these executive functioning problems that they have unfortunately. But they have them. And I guess it was part of my process and part of my mindset to finally, ","P1-N400B52":"OK, now you got to adjust because this is totally different than what it was. [00:39:13]
THERAPIST: What about it?
CLIENT: To be honest, it's childish. It's very childish. And I got my supervisor who's telling me, "Yea, I know. He's 20 years old. He needs to move on from it." But here I am. If I take that away from him, he melts down. And I'm just like here I am putting my perception on things. I can't judge these ","P1-N400BB1":"books without looking at the cover because it's what I did. [00:41:08] I judged this book by looking at him and going, OK, he's 20 years old. He's going to be kind of developed. He's going to know this. He's going to know that. And unfortunately he's one of my slower students. He just can't process ","P1-N400BB2":"the stuff like a normal 20 year old.
THERAPIST: Well, I think what happens is you're overly identified with him.
CLIENT: How?
THERAPIST: Well, you're sort of imagining... well, first of all, you were talking about him having difficulties being with other people. And you talked about that with yourself.
CLIENT: I do.
THERAPIST: And just in terms of like there's a... several times in the session where you said, "Well, I know how it is because this is how my parents were with me." It's hard for you to feel how different you are from them.
CLIENT: It... I guess I can't feel... well, I mean, different... I guess, yea, you're right. I can't really... I can't put that... those two together because I mean I feel I'm only different because I'm kind of normal, I guess. [00:43:09] I don't know. I don't have a disability. I guess that's what ","P1-N400C91":"makes me different from them. That's what I try to tell myself is that the only thing that's different between he and I is he has a disability and I don't. And I'm educated in his disability to help him better himself.
THERAPIST: Well, certainly, I mean, you identify that you have at least this similar issue, maybe others. But you have a much... you're not impaired the way they are. And you have a much greater capacity to manage that struggle and come to some sort of I don't know resolution or peace with it. So... ","P1-N400CD1":"but it does seem like you start to feel like they... like you sort of see similarities that aren't there and sort of feel frustrated that they're not doing more. Maybe you feel frustrated you're not doing more.
CLIENT: Yea. It's a perception thing. I mean, I see a 20 year old man. And my expectations of a 20 year old man aren't what this 20 year old man is. [00:45:00] It's of another 20 year old man.
THERAPIST: Well, and ironically... I mean, I don't know anything about him. Autism, there's a big spectrum.
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: But this 20 year old man might actually be doing quite well.
CLIENT: Yea.
THERAPIST: And relatively speaking to what he could be doing, you probably strive in ways that other people with the same disability might not be.
CLIENT: Exactly. And I don't know that. But my only thing is and this is my perception is I see a 20 year old man. And this is how clueless I am to the field is how uneducated I am to the field is I see a 20 year old man. And the 20 year old man I see is totally different than the 20 year old ","P1-N400DB1":"man that's in front of me every day. And I'm still trying to come to grasp of that. And I tell myself every day he's not a normal 20 year old man. And I guess that's what frustrates me because I think someday I'm going to walk in and I hope he's going to be like a regular 20 year old man. [00:46:01] ","P1-N400DB2":"Maybe it is that delusion that I have in my head.
THERAPIST: What upsets you about seeing him as a... when you see that he's a 20 year old man but acts like 7, what's upsetting about that?
CLIENT: What's... it's not upsetting. It's just frustrating. How can you obsess... and this is what bothers me is like his obsession over a game. Like a cartoon that's for like little children. I guess that part bothers me is the fact that his whole life revolves around this one game and getting to ","P1-N400DF1":"this one game. And that's all he talks about is this one game. And everything he does in school is to finish so he can go home and play this game. If he has homework, he can't play this game. So he does his homework during school to play this game. [00:47:00] I guess that's what irritates me the most ","P1-N400DF2":"is that he revolves his life around a video game. And it's not just like an adult video game. It's a kid's video game. And I guess that's what frustrates me the most is because there's all this opportunity out there for him to develop.
THERAPIST: There's opportunity for you out there as well.
CLIENT: No, I know.
THERAPIST: There may... but that's why I'm sort of highlighting the separateness...
CLIENT: OK.
THERAPIST: ...that you're having a hard time seeing. It's like you are not him and he is not you. And you do have those abilities and you do have those opportunities. And I think the frustration that you're feeling toward him is a frustration you feel toward yourself. And not seeing that you guys will ","P1-N400E91":"have different opportunities and different... that you'll have more opportunities.
CLIENT: Yea.
THERAPIST: And you'll have... you have more abilities. And so I'm not saying that simply because I think, oh, you should be more empathic to him. But that you're also much more... have much more potential in power than he has. And it's hard for you to feel that. [00:48:08] I think you're identified ","P1-N400ED1":"with the man who has severe autism.
CLIENT: Yea.
THERAPIST: So that's... I'm going to leave you with that. I notice we're out of time.
CLIENT: That's fine. Thank you.
THERAPIST: I will see you in two weeks then.
CLIENT: OK.
THERAPIST: OK, great.
CLIENT: Send me an e-mail of all times. I'm pretty flexible.
THERAPIST: Yea. And I'll send you an e-mail also about I don't know when it starts. I should know in the next couple of weeks.
CLIENT: OK, awesome. Thank you (inaudible at 00:48:26).
THERAPIST: All right. Take care.
