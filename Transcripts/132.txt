DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her tendency to try to make herself smaller, which stems from her relationship with her mother.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in. Thank you very much.
CLIENT: You're welcome.
THERAPIST: I have to get Kelly (sp?) to recalculate everything-
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: (cross talk at 00:01:22) I think you're not going to end up (inaudible at 00:01:25) for last month.
CLIENT: Okay. That's fine.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:01:29) that.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I should have...
CLIENT: So I was thinking more about the whole idea that we were talking about last week, where I was saying how I feel like I try to make myself smaller all the time. And I was listening to-there's this poem called "Shrinking Women," that went viral or whatever. But it's about this girl and she's talking ","P1-N4001F1":"about her relationship with her mom and how about she realizes that because of what learned from her mom, she's making herself smaller. [00:02:08]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I get that-I mean, that's what-
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It's imposed, it's (crosstalk at 00:08:06).
CLIENT: Yeah. It doesn't feel like it's genuine. And it makes me-it bothers me a lot, because it makes me come off as very young and very meek and very... This sweet, young girl type of persona, type of thing.
THERAPIST: It's very (inaudible at 00:21:59) when you walk around with this feeling that people wouldn't be interested in what you have to offer and you have to conform to something you're not.
CLIENT: Yeah, and it's led me to have despite the fact that through middle school age, I was getting up on stage and doing debates and doing all of this stuff then, because I decided that I was going to be this meek person, I developed an intense fear of public speaking, of speaking out. And that ","P1-N4006F1":"lasted all through college, that I was so scared of everybody around me and of saying anything.
THERAPIST: It's easier to be yourself when you're in an environment that encourages it.
CLIENT: Yeah. That's the thing.
THERAPIST: It's harder to yourself if you're no in an environment that encourages it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It's always easier to do something different.
CLIENT: Yeah. A lot of times, it's easier for me to feel like I'm not upsetting people than to feel like because I was assertive and said what I had to say, I might have offended some people or I might have upset some people. [00:29:07] That's okay.
THERAPIST: When (ph) people do make judgments but in different directions, you have no idea (crosstalk at 00:31:41).
CLIENT: Yeah, you don't know.
THERAPIST: And it could be the complete opposite and for the opposite reasons, for their own personal issues.
CLIENT: Right, and that's the thing, it's knowing that probably has nothing to do with me. That, yes, it's probably happening but that's fine and I don't need to worry. [00:32:05] It's other people. And I need to do what I'm doing and say what I have to say.
THERAPIST: Wrong in whose eyes?
CLIENT: In my parents' eyes. And I still feel that need when my grandmother writes me a letter and says, "You're so sweet, just like your mother," or something, part of me still feels like that's good. [00:34:06] There's still that part of me that that thinks, "Oh, she thinks I'm doing all this," and ","P1-N400AB1":"that's really-there's part of me that still thinks that's the right thing to do, because it was told to me so many times.
THERAPIST: Your parents, but your mom in particular, needed you to be a particular way for her.
CLIENT: Yeah, very polite and very sweet and very-definitely very apologetic and always doing things for other people, that was really important. [00:37:00] And then I was told that that's who I was. And then I believed that that's who I was.
THERAPIST: Yes, but also not believed it, which created...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...a different probably a better kind of calm, ultimately but a calm, too.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It was, "This is not right." You didn't completely lose yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah. And it took me a long time, though, to realize that. [00:39:00] Because I feel like it wasn't until I met my boyfriend and that we were truly well together, because a lot of the things he enjoys were things that I actually enjoyed but I forgot that I enjoyed.
THERAPIST: It feels like a loss.
CLIENT: Yeah. It feels like lost years, or something. But I don't want to... [00:42:01] I think that going through all of that and acting a certain way or trying so hard to fit in is not what I would have wanted to be doing. But at the same time, I wonder if it's good that I went through it so that ","P1-N400D91":"now I can really realize who I am.
THERAPIST: How do you mean, "accidentally"?
CLIENT: [laughs] As in, I have all these behaviors that I'm trying to break, that are learned behaviors that I was taught are right and it's hard for me to break them. And if I got stressed or something and wasn't aware of what I was saying, and said something about the word "diet" or said something ","P1-N400E11":"about-there are words and certain things that I don't actually even want to say in my house. And I always fear that I'll be stressed or be unaware of what I'm saying and say something about dieting or say something about wanting to lose weight. [00:45:08]
THERAPIST: You'll just forget.
CLIENT: Yeah. [laughs] I'll get stressed and say the word "fat." I use it so much, negatively, towards myself. And it's something that I don't want to use. And it's a word that I don't want my kids to hear me-there are certain words, like "weight," "diet," and "fat," and "obese." There are certain words ","P1-N400E91":"that are so negative for me and they bring up so much emotion that I don't want my kids to have to see that. [00:47:05]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:48:02) you're talking about wanting to protect future children from some of the things that you were not protected from (crosstalk at 00:48:10).
CLIENT: Sorry. Yeah. I think that's the thing, it's being angry that I wasn't protected from it and knowing what it resulted in, yeah.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:48:23)
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I'm not sure I mentioned, the first week of February, I'm away.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay? (crosstalk at 00:48:28)
CLIENT: Oh, yeah, I'll just (crosstalk at 00:48:29) my calendar.
THERAPIST: Yeah, it's still a few weeks away, but...
CLIENT: Okay, all right.
THERAPIST: Okay. Okay, great. I'll see you next week.
CLIENT: See you next week.
THERAPIST: Okay, take care.
