DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the burden of having to help her mother in life while attempting to start her own career. Client discusses how her parents' failed marriage continues to have an impact on her life.
THERAPIST: Hi. come on in.
CLIENT: Sorry I'm late. (LAUGHTER) (SIGH) (inaudible at 00:01:39) Trying to finish too many things before I leave. So... (SIGH) I looked at like five apartments yesterday with my mom and it's the same thing, you know, the place you want, they don't want you and the places you don't want... It's just ","P1-N4000F1":"like... (LAUGHTER) (SIGH) [00:02:09]
THERAPIST: It's not clear if you live with your mother or she lives with you.
CLIENT: Is that... So like that needs to be clear or like...
THERAPIST: I wasn't suggesting that needs to be clear. I'm just saying it's... It's not.
CLIENT: Yeah. But, I mean, wouldn't it be... Even for my friend, wouldn't it be unclear because I'm sure she must make more money than her mom. I'm not sure actually. [00:07:01]
THERAPIST: It feels like it's imposed from the outside?
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:09:51) So if I impose it on myself I wouldn't feel so bad you're saying?
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) [00:09:59]
THERAPIST: Impose is a loaded word. Right?
CLIENT: Yeah. I did it, as they say. You know, like I was talking to this guy last night and he was like, you know, much younger than me and his parents live in Nepal. He's thinking of moving back and he was just like, "You know, it's my decision to take. If something goes wrong, then it was mine and, ","P1-N400331":"you know, I'll take responsibility for it." But this is not... You're right. This is not my decision. You know? It's because my dad was an absolute abusive shit that, you know, we are in this situation, I feel. Like if he had been half way decent, we would have had a lot more resources and pretty much ","P1-N400332":"that I feel is the cause because like everyone else's parents are there. You know, like... Yeah. Their mothers are being taken care of by their fathers. (LAUGHTER) [00:10:57]
THERAPIST: Do you think you don't deserve to have choices?
CLIENT: I really don't think I don't deserve them. Like what kinds of choices?
THERAPIST: Your choice to not live with your mother, your choice not to have the kind of obligation you feel toward her. [00:13:03]
CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like it's just there. It's a constraint and I just have to, you know, like with it like a handicap. That's a very bad word. But...
THERAPIST: I mean, certainly in her eyes and I imagine from your culture when, you know, thirty years ago, she very much felt mired down by obligation that her dreams were shattered because of the obligation she had to follow...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...you know, her parents' dictates in terms of marriage. And she vocalizes that that, you know, her life was so mired, if not ruined by obligation. And it seems that in some ways you're carrying on that legacy. [00:14:01]
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I don't... I feel like the culture has changed in the sense that... I mean, marriage is still considered very important but like girls in middle class families are definitely encouraged to pursue education a lot more. It's really a double bin that we have. (LAUGHTER) you know, ","P1-N400471":"like scholars have written about this and stuff. But, you know, it the bind of (inaudible at 00:14:41) tradition and modern (inaudible). you know, like, on the one hand, we have to go traditional, we have to get married and stuff. But we also have to be modern and we have to, you know, get a PhD or ","P1-N400472":"a master's and be independent as well. So...
CLIENT: Like people my age with my kind of educational background are supposed to make, you know, like a hundred thousand dollars (LAUGHTER) over a hundred thousand dollars. I don't know. If I made that kind of money, I would get an apartment in a heartbeat. (LAUGHTER) So... But... (PAUSE) I don't know ","P1-N4004F1":"if I deserve, if I feel like I don't deserve choices. (PAUSE) I thought I just, it would be possible to live kind of narrowly, you know, like in a little box not impose too much of myself and my life, I guess, on the outside world. [00:17:05]
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know if I want to be in a tiny box or out in the world just like bumping up against people and (SIGH) you know, having good healthy interactions. (PAUSE) It's funny... (LAUGHTER) The last time Victor and I were together, he was showing me Grey Gardens, the movie. I don't know if ","P1-N400551":"you've seen it. [00:19:07]
THERAPIST: Well, I would phrase the question a little bit differently but with the same aim. What's preventing you from feeling you have choices?
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Preventing me... Hmm... (PAUSE) Yeah, I mean, that's true. It's just my fear, I guess, that she won't be able to take care of herself. I'm afraid. I don't know of what. Am I afraid of the guilt or am I afraid of something that actually might happen? I don't know. I don't know what ","P1-N4005F1":"I'm afraid of. It's funny. Like that's exactly kind of what Victor was saying, not really saying, but really just his being and actions were posing to me that, "You know, I'm going to walk away and we're not going to see each other." [00:23:09]
THERAPIST: Her helplessness? Is that what got to you?
CLIENT: Yeah. Just that she was... Yeah. (SIGH) That was just really, really scary... Yeah. I mean, bleak. I don't know why it's so bleak because there's bleaker things, you know, like literature and the world. But... Just my own mother's helplessness, I guess.
THERAPIST: Well, it's like feeling there's no pillar for you.
CLIENT: Why do I need a pillar? (LAUGHTER) Why I can't I be a pillar? (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Yeah. I think everybody needs a pillar and it's true that hopefully, at some point, you become your own pillar. But usually you need someone else to serve that purpose for you to be able to create that for yourself. [00:31:09]
CLIENT: You mean I need that or one does?
THERAPIST: In general, I believe, yes.
CLIENT: Well, Victor doesn't have a pillar. (LAUGHTER) He's his one pillar. He's like ten pillars. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: How do you know he never had a pillar?
CLIENT: I assume that just because of his life. He... His parents sent him off to like a boarding school. He's an only child and yet they sent him off. So it seems that he's been independent from a very young age. His parents are really old. They're in their seventies I think and, yeah, he sends them ","P1-N400811":"money and takes care of them. So I feel like he's exceptionally strong or he thinks he is exceptionally strong. I don't know. (LAUGHTER) [00:32:05]
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: Why is that horrible? Shouldn't we be proud of the people we love? Shouldn't you want to like parade them around? Not parade them around. But, you know, like... [00:34:09]
THERAPIST: Does your mother evoke admiration from other people?
CLIENT: (SIGH) In some people. I don't know admiration...
THERAPIST: Well, sort of pride. The idea of being proud is that people admire.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't think I admire, I inspire admiration. (LAUGHTER) Maybe in some fleeting instance if they don't know the whole story. Like if they say, "Oh, you're taking care of your mom. How cool is that?" (LAUGHTER) But... Yeah. I don't know if she inspires admiration. Like a big chunk is that... ","P1-N400911":"What I do know is that her family has completely shunned her and that this is, you know, what's happened twenty five years ago when she took my dad back. [00:35:07]
THERAPIST: Why? Why were they upset?
CLIENT: But they didn't like him at all and like, you know, his family treated her really badly so she came back home and then like all these people and her siblings were away doing their own thing, they're married and whatnot and this one brother who she was closest and lived with, he came to the US. ","P1-N400971":"So... And then my dad came like five years later and then my mom accepted and everyone was like, "How could you after all that he's done? You know, all the pain he's caused us and..." You know, at one point, one of her brothers was like, "I'm just going to take him down. You know? Really just do something ","P1-N400972":"about him." [00:36:07]
THERAPIST: But she didn't chose him. It was an arranged marriage, wasn't it?
CLIENT: Yeah. But she chose... She gave him a second chance. So that's what they're angry about. Because I think the divorce was under way so... But then they remarried... I don't even know.
THERAPIST: The divorce was under way when you were a kid, when you were young? [00:36:53]
CLIENT: Yeah. So...
THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess... I understand that piece, I guess. But she didn't chose him. She was assigned him.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It seems sort of unfair that she would be judged.
CLIENT: Yeah. Absolutely. But then why did she have to take him a second time is what they, their story is.
THERAPIST: Where did her parents find him?
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) He was a student (ph) and my mom's sister's husband was an employee there and like the warden for the dorms where he lived. So all these students used to come by his house, my mom's sister, would kind of be friendly with them and she just sort of picked him. And he was notoriously... ","P1-N400AD1":"Like he had a bad reputation, my mom says. And still like, her sister said, "No, just go ahead." [00:37:59]
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: There were all these signs for them not to get married which were ignored and she blames her sister entirely for pushing it, the lines along. So... This is like a whole bunch of blame game (LAUGHTER) that she does. It's not a game. I'm sure it's legitimate. But I feel it's... For several years, ","P1-N400B31":"I've just been tired of this narrative. As a child, I completely accepted it. But for a while now I've been tired. Like why... This is so debilitating to be like, "You did this to me. Look. I mean, because of you, I got married and then my life is ruined." You know? [00:39:05]
CLIENT: So you think living with my mom probably is making me feel very encumbered right now? (LAUGHTER) I don't know. I don't know if it's like the therapy or it's really this is what my mind is like all the time when I'm living with her. (LAUGHTER) I don't know.
THERAPIST: How do you mean, "Is it the therapy?"
CLIENT: I mean, you know, bringing this stuff out, like the buried stuff in the background, bringing it out is making me feel like, wow, this is what I... I don't know. Is it what I'm like all the time or... Like would my mind be absolutely like a blank piece of paper with which I could do whatever ","P1-N400BF1":"if I'm living with my mom or if I'm not living with my mom? I don't know?
THERAPIST: You're wondering what's creating this unrest?
CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) I... (PAUSE) I feel like her father sometimes. (LAUGHTER) Like, "What do we do with this daughter who's unmarried?" (LAUGHTER) And then I feel like, why don't I have someone like that worried about me? Like, "What do we do with (inaudible at 00:42:35)" There's no one who is thinking of...
THERAPIST: Like your mother?
CLIENT: Yeah. Like her. She's...
THERAPIST: Like mothers often do with their daughters?
CLIENT: Yeah. I think her extent, the extent of her thinking about me is like, "What can I feed her?" (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: (SIGH) (PAUSE) I mean, it would be awesome to have a pillar but... Right now it's just Chris. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) I mean, encumbrances can be pillars. Right? Your chains, your shackles can be, can hold you in place. (LAUGHTER) And that can feel stable and pillar-like.
THERAPIST: That's very interesting. I was thinking though a pillar isn't necessarily something that holds you in place. But something you can go to for strength.
CLIENT: To lean on and stuff.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. You're usually not chained to a pillar.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) But can you not be chained? You know, like you get so used to having it that it is a chain and... I don't know. Maybe I'm overcomplicating things.
THERAPIST: You know, (inaudible at 00:44:47) stop for today. So I will see you on Monday and let's talk more about Skype and so forth on Monday. Is that good?
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay?
CLIENT: Okay. Sounds good.
THERAPIST: Okay. Very good.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Have a good day.
THERAPIST: Okay. You too. Bye bye.
CLIENT: Bye. [00:45:03]
