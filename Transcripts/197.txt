DESCRIPTION: Client discusses how and when she became aware of her sexuality, and what it was like to come out. Client discusses how her sexuality has grown and changed since coming out.
THERAPIST: Hi! Come on in!
CLIENT: How are you?
THERAPIST: Good, thank you!
CLIENT: I have a check for you, before I forget.
THERAPIST: Thank you! And did Helen (ph) send you the statement and the link to Blue Cross?
CLIENT: Yeah, I sent it them yesterday.
THERAPIST: Okay, oh great! Great! It was pretty clear?
CLIENT: Yeah, it was straightforward, so... And I assume you'll just let me know when you get the payment, or...? [00:01:06]
THERAPIST: They actually often will send it to you.
CLIENT: Oh, and then I'll bring it? Oh, great. Yeah, I wasn't sure how that worked, so... I'm assuming that Helen would have checked that it was covered under my plan first, right?
THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. No, it's fine.
CLIENT: Good. Just checking. I don't want to have to make that call to my mom! (laughs)
THERAPIST: Everything should be fine. How are you, though?
CLIENT: Good. Doing well today. It's been a busy weekend at work, so... That's always good. (therapist responds) (pause) And, yeah. That's about it. Amelia's going to Philadelphia next week. I actually haven't thought that much about it, because I've been busy, which is good. (therapist responds) So ","P1-N400251":"hopefully that will go all right. Hopefully! (chuckles) [00:02:06]
THERAPIST: That's how you ended the last session, talking about all the experiences you had, which you felt, many of which were not yet processed. [00:03:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. Or maybe they are processed, I don't know. I mean, I don't know how to tell like, when I've processed it, because I do feel like I've changed a lot since coming back, which is expected. Like, you know, I always knew that like, I would go and then come back a different person, but I always ","P1-N4002B1":"thought like, it would all be for the better, you know? And... I mean, that's definitely not necessarily what happened. So I don't know if I've like, processed everything and like, this is just how it is now; or like, this is how it is because I haven't really dealt with what went on over there; I don't know.
THERAPIST: Well, certainly feeling unsafe is not a good thing, it sounds like.
CLIENT: Right. (therapist affirms) And like, I feel like that's translated now to me worrying about like, my safety, Amelia's safety, you know. But then we've talked about things like from when I was a kid that also, you know, so it's not like it's a brand new thing. (therapist affirms) But the way ","P1-N4002F1":"that it kind of materializes now is different, is new. For sure. [00:04:04]
THERAPIST: So thinking about the importance of Freddy being around. Is it Amelia's physical safety that you're concerned about?
CLIENT: (affirms) Yeah. (pause) Because I don't know where he lives, and she has to like, get places, you know. She's got this conference downtown, but it's like an hour commute on public transit from where he lives. And you know, I mean like I said a couple of weeks ago, like she's been all over the ","P1-N400331":"world by herself, you know. I think she can navigate Philadelphia, but I don't know.
THERAPIST: Well, it's not a rational fear. (client affirms) Philadelphia is probably a lot safer than a lot of the places that she's been. [00:05:00]
CLIENT: I guess so. I don't know, it's funny, when I think about like, how I felt unsafe a lot of times in Egypt. I also never worried about Amelia's safety in Egypt, because like, the sense of community there, and you have people... Like, even though there were times when I didn't feel safe, I kind ","P1-N400371":"of never felt like I was going to die. Like, I didn't think that anything was really going to like... like I was going to cease to exist, you know, something really bad was going to happen, because you like, the way that the communities are there, you just don't... Like there is the verbal harassment ","P1-N400372":"is one thing, but like very rarely did it ever get physical, just because of the conservative nature of the communities there, and how everybody knows everybody. So if, you know, word gets out that you touched the American girl, then like, your life is going to be a living hell. You know, and so like, ","P1-N400373":"I wouldn't know where Amelia was for like, a whole day at a time, but I always knew that like, she was looked after by the people in her community. (therapist responds) Then I don't feel like, that's definitely not the way it is here, you know. That's a big cultural difference. So... Yeah, it's like ","P1-N400374":"all these weird, I feel like, contradictions and... [00:06:22]
THERAPIST: There is a sense of accountability over there.
CLIENT: Yeah. Like, you just didn't hear about the kind of stuff you hear about on the news here, you know? Like people didn't go missing, people didn't take people, people... you know what I mean? Like murder wasn't really something that... I mean, probably in the capitol and like things happen, but ","P1-N4003B1":"it was usually like men doing it to other men. Like, women were this like, tended to be a protect ... I mean you have honor killings, which is like another whole situation, but otherwise, women tended to be this like protected... because it was very sexist, you know, just like protected, revered, ","P1-N4003B2":"kept in the house, kept safe from all the outside dangers kind of thing. So... [00:07:10]
THERAPIST: Like what?
CLIENT: Like, well, they just put such... And maybe it was stuff that already kind of, I was like predisposed to being, kind of drinking the Kool-Aid a lot, you know? Like, they just put such emphasis on community, and family, and being together all the time. And they make like... If I wanted to spend ","P1-N400411":"time alone, they would make me, I would feel so guilty for wanting to spend time alone, because my landlord's family just always wanted... They, you know, they thought it was like a sin for me to be by myself downstairs. Like, what is she, they would always say like, you know like, translated, it's ","P1-N400412":"like, "What a shame, that you would be by yourself and nobody to hang out with you." (therapist responds) [00:08:31]
THERAPIST: Not so much.
CLIENT: But I got used to being around them all the time. Like, you know, after a while, I became, I grew comfortable and just hanging out upstairs with the family, and constantly being around them, and didn't have such, you know, it was like normal to just hang out up there. It was like they were my ","P1-N400471":"family, you know? It wasn't a big deal. Like, I could read my own book on the couch. (therapist affirms) Well, they didn't have couches, but like the cushion. You know, and they would be doing their own thing. But we'd all just be in the same room, you know? It was like keeping each other company. So ","P1-N400472":"I got used to that. (pause) And so then, that was quite a harsh transition like, by the end, you know, that was something I really enjoyed doing, hanging out upstairs all the time. So, it was kind of funny; I never really thought about that.
THERAPIST: That's a very different lifestyle. [00:10:23]
CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, yeah! I mean, it's wild! And I've been, I've done stints in a lot of different places, and experienced a lot of different cultures, but nothing was as different as Egyptian culture from American culture. It was just like the wildest place I'd ever been, you know? I mean, there is just ","P1-N4004B1":"nothing like (chuckles) Egyptian culture, compared to American culture.
THERAPIST: (pause) Have you been feeling less anxious overall?
CLIENT: (pause) I'm not sure. Because it's not, I don't feel like constantly... And I haven't ever really felt like constantly in a state of anxiety, you know? I feel like I have episodes of it, and so... The last, and I can't remember when the last time was. I mean, I got a little bit worried yesterday. ","P1-N4004F1":"I took Tylenol, which was like a big step for me, yesterday, because I was having really bad cramps. Amelia made me just take the Tylenol. It was bad enough that I took it, but then I had like a slight... moment of anxiousness afterwards. Just that I was going to like hurt my ulcer, I don't know. I ","P1-N4004F2":"mean, because I haven't taken any medication, aside from my stomach medication, since I got the ulcer from pain relievers in the first place. So... And I wasn't excited about that, but... I know other than that like, I don't really remember the last... I don't remember the last time that I like, really ","P1-N4004F3":"freaked out about Amelia. But I also, you know, like we haven't had a situation where we've been like, I couldn't reach... I don't know, like it's just been smooth sailing for a while now. [00:12:33]
THERAPIST: You're not sure if it's you're feeling better or just circumstantial.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I can't tell. Last week, after our session (I guess it was the same day, yeah), and I met her. I like, had to go back to, I went back to work for a little bit, and then I didn't have time to work out, so I was like feeling antsy. So I met her and we like, went for a little bit of ","P1-N400531":"a walk. I told her a little bit about what we had talked about, and we talked about, you know, how the little things contribute to that overall feeling. We ended up having like, a really, really long conversation that like we both really, I think, needed to have.
THERAPIST: So, have you ever written down your worries while you're having them?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: I wonder if that would be a useful exercise.
CLIENT: You're not the first person to suggest that to me, and I don't know why I haven't done it yet. (therapist responds) When I was in college, I did for a little while. But then I remember finding them a couple of years later and like, I read through some of what I had written. It was like, it was ","P1-N4005D1":"just awful. It made me like, upset to read what I had written, because I had a real, I was like really in a bad place for a while when I was a freshman in college. I think I'm like scared... I don't know, I'm like scared of what I'll write down, I think, because I'm still like embarrassed and... you ","P1-N4005D2":"know? It's like, still that like, shame that prevents me from, from doing that because I always think about it. I'm like, "Maybe I should write down what I'm thinking right now." Then I'm like, "No. Just go for a run," you know? (pause) Because it's like embarrassing. Then, when I write it down, it's ","P1-N4005D3":"like worse than just saying it. It takes me awhile to like, even get ready to like say something, but like writing it is so permanent. [00:15:13]
THERAPIST: What's so embarrassing about your fears?
CLIENT: I don't' know. I just like know how irrational they are... you know? It's like, it's bizarre, because I know that I'm having like, very irrational reactions to things. I know that... but like, I can't stop it from happening at the same time. So it creates this like, weird embarrassment, because ","P1-N400611":"like I feel like I, like... makes me like not normal to be having these kinds of fears and worries and stuff like that. So I just try to like, pretend like they're not happening.
THERAPIST: It doesn't sound like it goes too well.
CLIENT: Well, (chuckles) obviously not! Yeah, so... I mean, I can put more of an effort into writing things down.
THERAPIST: But it's, it's, what prevents you is this embarrassed reaction. (client affirms) Does it mean like, you're a crazy person? What does it mean? [00:16:12]
CLIENT: I don't know. I just, it goes back to this like, feeling I've always had since I was a kid, that like, there is something wrong with me. You know, like I always thought that there, I was just like, not right, like because I was really overweight and then I was dealing, when I was dealing with ","P1-N400691":"my sexuality like, I was like... I used to remember like, I would just sit there, like when I would be upset and I'd cry, and just like, in my head, just like list all the things that were not, like wrong with me. You know, I'd be like, "I'm fat and I'm apparently I'm a lesbian..." I had this like horrible ","P1-N400692":"habit of biting my nails; that was always on the list when I was younger, because my mom would always try to get me to stop biting my nails, so it was like always on my mind.
THERAPIST: That someone would sort of find out that all these things are wrong with you?
CLIENT: Yeah. I'd feel like I never thought that, but like, what would happen, but like I didn't want anyone to know. (pause) And I still do a good job of like hiding things, you know? People have no idea that I... There is like, I can count the number of people on one hand, on like three or four fingers, ","P1-N4006F1":"that know that I have like issues with anxiety. People are generally pretty surprised when they find out, too.
THERAPIST: Do you remember how old you were when you started thinking about sort of just feeling ashamed about your problems? [00:18:29]
CLIENT: I think it was middle school, because I think that was when I first started having like... I remember, I mean, I feel like I always probably felt a little bit, from my weight, but like it got really bad when I started like, having feelings for my girlfriends and stuff, without really knowing ","P1-N400731":"what that was. But that's when I really remember like, thinking like, "Man! All these things that are wrong with me!" So I think it was middle, it must have been like middle school-ish. And then like, definitely in high school.
THERAPIST: So that was around middle school was the time where you were thinking about your sexuality or even just trying to figure out what your feelings meant? (client affirms) Did you know about sexual orientation, was it just sort of like, "I have no idea what's going on"? [00:19:15]
CLIENT: I just didn't, I just like remember, I don't know. I just like, there was just something like, different about the way that I felt than the way that I could tell my friends talked about boys and stuff. I had a boyfriend in middle school, these two boyfriends, for like all of middle school. Not ","P1-N400771":"at the same time, like one, and then the other one. (pause) I don't know; it was exciting, because like somebody liked me. But... I still would have like, rather gone and hung out with my friend Fran than my boyfriend Bill, like any day of the week, you know?
THERAPIST: Was that true throughout high school?
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It's funny, I ended up kind of having this fling with this girl that I went to high school with like, three years ago, four years ago, when I was in the Red Cross. It was, you know, like, it would just, in high school like, I don't know. I went to a really small school in a town ","P1-N4007D1":"where nobody was gay. So... And like it turned out that this girl had actually been dating another girl throughout high school, I just had no idea.
THERAPIST: I was going to say, where people don't talk about being gay, (inaudible) (blocked) no one (inaudible).
CLIENT: That's true, that's true, so people are definitely gay.
THERAPIST: They don't have like sort of town, you know, lines. (laughs)
CLIENT: That's true. Yeah, and I remember it was funny, you know, after... She was a, we were just good friends throughout high school. We were on the softball team together and we were just good buddies. I always thought there was something going on with her and the pitcher, but like I never really, ","P1-N400851":"you know, nobody talked about it. She had a boyfriend the whole time.
THERAPIST: Wow! Did it get any easier in college, to at least identify with other people who were gay?
CLIENT: No, because where I went to college, there was not a huge gay community. I was, I became like, the token lesbian on campus, because there was nobody... You had, the outlook was the name of like, the LGBTQ Student Alliance, and it was made up of people who were pretty socially awkward and not... ","P1-N4008B1":"(pause) They were really isolated from the rest of the campus community, which obviously, I mean, at a very white conservative school that, you know, I don't blame them, but by the time I came out, when I was a junior... Then so I was really only out and on my college campus for a year and a half, because ","P1-N4008B2":"I was abroad for the first semester of my junior year. Then I came back, and I had second semester and then my senior year. I was just like the only approachable out lesbian on campus, essentially. [00:23:08]
THERAPIST: Very particular experience.
CLIENT: Yeah, it's crazy. The campus has changed a lot, you know. Now it's a lot more diverse, but I just happened to be there before being gay was like as accepted. I mean, I guess a lot has changed in the last couple of years. It turned out, I mean, after I came out, then a lot of my friends started ","P1-N400931":"to come out as well and you know... Out of my group of college friends like, half of us are gay, but I was the first one to come out when we were in school. But I didn't do so until I was abroad. [00:25:25]
THERAPIST: Did it feel like a secret?
CLIENT: (affirms) It was a secret, but like I wasn't acting on it, either, you know? I was still sleeping with men and trying to like, fig , you know, just because I only had... There was only straight girls for me to have feelings for. So there was still like, there was nothing wrong with me, why ","P1-N400971":"they weren't liking me back. Then I lost all that weight... and then I came out, and then I started to get like, other girls, you know what I mean? So it just like was like a weird pattern of reinforcement for me, too, that like I needed to be skinny and athletic and... to be able to be loved, kind ","P1-N400972":"of thing. Because it just all kind of happened that way at the same time.
THERAPIST: A lot of times, emotions get formed around coincidences. [00:26:19]
CLIENT: Yeah. It was totally, I mean it was totally circumstantial. (therapist affirms) (pause) I don't remember why I started talking about that.
THERAPIST: Well, we started talking about what, writing down your worries (client affirms), and feeling embarrassed, and feeling that there was something wrong with you. Then you thought about this whole history, and feeling something was wrong with you. And having no one to share it with, too.
CLIENT: Yeah, it's been, I'll, like I've, that's definitely been a pattern. I don't really open up to people about it. Even like, I saw that therapist in Chicago for quite some time and I mean... it took me like, years before I even was like, "Um, I think I'm gay," you know?
THERAPIST: How old were you?
CLIENT: Um, I went to see her when I was in high school. And then... but like I think my mom wanted me to go, so I could have, talk about what direction I wanted to go in, career wise, or something like that. It wasn't for, I don't know, I don't remember why. It was like something related to college ","P1-N400A31":"and jobs. And it wasn't until... must have been like 19 , yeah, it was around the same time like I was coming out at school, like 19 or 20. [00:27:45]
THERAPIST: Was it just sort of this pervasive fear, or did you have particular thoughts about what people would say or do or think?
CLIENT: I was just like always scared of being rejected. (therapist responds) Like as long as I wasn't... telling these girls that I had feelings for them, and as long as I was just like thinking about it, and thinking about like, ways that I could make them like me (like losing weight or getting better ","P1-N400A71":"at rugby, you know), then there was still that hope, I think. (pause) And I was just scared what would happen if I, because I still thought it was like a wrong feeling to be having, you know.
THERAPIST: Because girls shouldn't have feelings for other girls?
CLIENT: Yeah, not among my friends, no. It wasn't something I was ever exposed to.
THERAPIST: It wasn't, it doesn't sound like it was the coming out that was the problem.
CLIENT: That's true.
THERAPIST: It was the (inaudible) (blocked)
CLIENT: Yeah, my coming out experience was really positive. Everybody was really supportive and they were like waiting for it, you know? Then once I could be open about how I had these like, really unhealthy feelings for my good friend Nancy and like, the rest of my friends rallied behind me. They were ","P1-N400B71":"like, "She's not (ph) nice to you," you know? "Move on. We'll find you somebody else," and it was wonderful. Yeah. Like everything good happened after I came out, you know? But yeah, it was definitely the before part that was troubling for me.
THERAPIST: And years and years and years of it. (client affirms) It sounds like you felt isolated. (client affirms) Like, very isolated. I wonder if it relates to your difficulty being alone. [00:30:24]
CLIENT: It might. Because I mean, I felt like that I had nobody for so long, you know? (therapist responds) I mean, like realistically, I did. I was always surrounded by wonderful people, but I still, there was like these huge things I wasn't talking about. (pause) I mean, I didn't exactly get positive ","P1-N400BB1":"reinforcement when I did, you know, when I did try to tell my mom that I was struggling with an eating thing and that I was doing drugs and... You know, she kind of like shot me down in that moment. I didn't revisit that, I have never revisited that conversation. So I didn't really get like, I mean, ","P1-N400BB2":"when I came out, yeah, it was like, great. You know, and everyone was really awesome about it. My friends were, you know, I have friends that I can talk to about anything. But, it was almost like, with that situation like, you know, I think they, yeah, that's like, "Right. Remember, you're not supposed ","P1-N400BB3":"to talk to people about like, those big problems," kind of thing.
THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?
CLIENT: I was thinking like, trying to figure out why I don't like being alone and like, what I think about when I'm alone. (therapist responds) (pause) Like nothing specific is really coming to mind, because I really, like I'm not feeling alone that much. I mean, some days I feel like it, you know? ","P1-N400C11":"But I usually, like I tend to distract myself.
THERAPIST: That does sound nice!
CLIENT: Yeah, it felt good. (pause) I don't know. It's just been like, a nice week like... Not that joining a jam is the answer to my problems, but I feel like that's helped a lot. You know, and I've been going with one of my co-workers. We're like becoming, we're like new friends so we have like, lots ","P1-N400C91":"to talk about. It's just like, it's nice, yeah. (therapist responds) [00:34:18]
THERAPIST: Like replacing somehow?
CLIENT: Yeah. Like I wanted that like, flirty attention and I wasn't getting it, because Amelia was gone all day. (pause) Because I like attention, it's always been something like, I like it when people are giving me attention, especially sexual attention. (therapist responds) But I felt like after ","P1-N400D11":"Amelia and I like, talked about it for a couple of minutes like, I felt better. It was just like, I think it was making me feel shitty because I wasn't talking to Amelia about it. Then that was making me feel like I was doing something wrong, because it was something that was making me not want to tell ","P1-N400D12":"Amelia about it.
THERAPIST: Because...? [00:37:36]
CLIENT: Because it had never happened before, and it reminded me of my history in college with women. But then it also made me feel like, "Well, why am I looking for, like...?" You know, because I have no desire to do, to do anything with Brenda. She's a very cute girl, but like I would... never, I ","P1-N400D91":"don't know. Like, I don't, I would never do anything to be disloyal to Amelia, and I don't have any desire to. Like, I don't feel like I want to hang out with Brenda alone, you know what I mean? Like, I don't feel like I want to explore that or anything like that. But it just never... I don't know. ","P1-N400D92":"I flirted back with her and then I felt bad about it. (therapist responds)
THERAPIST: Yeah, it seemed like it was less about Brenda, her potential interest in you and more about why would you be thinking about her.
CLIENT: (affirms) (pause) But yeah, I feel like after Amelia and I had a conversation just about how I'd been feeling the last couple of weeks, and feeling kind of lonely and isolated. Then once I was finally like, "Well this is what's been like, going on with Brenda at work and it's freaking me out ","P1-N400E11":"and..." I felt, I don't know. I just felt like we reconnected this weekend and we've had a really good week and I'm feeling like a lot better about things. But I still feel kind of weird around Brenda at work. I don't know, I can't describe it. We went to the gym together the other night and we had ","P1-N400E12":"a good time, and it was fine. But like, I don't' know. I think now that the thought has been in my head like, it's, I'm just like, can't shake it.
THERAPIST: Is that a direct question?
CLIENT: Yes! (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I am not a very good judge of normal. But I don't know if that's the question.
CLIENT: Not normal, but like is it, I don't know.
THERAPIST: Is it...
CLIENT: Like, is it unhealthy in our relationship for like, Amelia or I to be attracted to somebody else? It depends on Amelia and my relationship, right? [00:41:18]
THERAPIST: That's also just a different way of saying is it normal? (laughs) (client affirms) To me, what seems important is that you worry about these things. You begin to question yourself and wonder if there is something wrong, and then you begin to feel insecure.
CLIENT: (affirms) And that's, I mean, it's funny like, when you phrase it like that, because I always used to think that there was something wrong with me like, inter-relationships also, because I never... I always cheated. Technically, in my eyes, it wasn't cheating, because I was telling the person ","P1-N400F51":"that I was sleeping with somebody else. So I wasn't lying and cheating, I was honestly cheating. But I never felt connected with somebody enough not to want to do that, and so I just always thought there was something wrong with me. (therapist responds) [00:42:09]
THERAPIST: There is something that freaks you out about other thoughts that you have.
CLIENT: (pause) Was that a question?
THERAPIST: No, it was a statement.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And then like, I felt like I was trying to convince myself last week that it was fine, you know? But like, the more I tried to convince myself, then the more I freaked myself out, because I'm like, "Why are you trying to convince yourself? Either it's fine or it's not. If you're ","P1-N400FF1":"trying so hard to convince yourself, then what's going on?" I mean, I needed to talk to Amelia about it. And I did, and then I felt better, but... [00:43:27]
THERAPIST: You have a lot of worries.
CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah! (pause) Well I just, I don't know. I thought of like, "What would I think if like, Amelia was doing this?" You know? I don't know, I just don't... I would never want to do anything that would hurt her, you know? And I kept trying to think like, "If she knew, if she was like ","P1-N401031":"watching our interactions right now, what would she think, you know?" And then like, talking to her about it and seeing her like, laugh it off and like, asked me, it was like, she asked me, she was like, "Well, do you think she's hot?" And then I turned red, and she laughed about it, you know? And I ","P1-N401032":"think she, like it doesn't, she's so comfortable and confident in us and I am, too, but... not as, I don't know. It's not that I'm not as much as her, but like I get worried, you know, about everything. And I'm always worrying like... [00:44:22]
THERAPIST: You worry about the relationship and you worry about yourself in particular (client affirms), your own capacities.
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. Those are the symptoms (ph) of Jewish Mother Syndrome like, there is always something we...I'm terrified, like God forbid, we have kids!
