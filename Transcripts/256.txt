DESCRIPTION: Client is conflicted about how she feels for her current boyfriend and whether or not she's still in love with an ex. Client does not feel accepted by her family and wishes she was deserving of love and a good career.
THERAPIST: Cecelia (ph)?
CLIENT: Hi.
THERAPIST: Hi Cecelia (ph). How are you?
CLIENT: Good. How are you?
THERAPIST: Good, good. I figured I would call. I wasn't sure if you had tried to call me earlier.
CLIENT: I just thought since, you know, I wait out in the living room, in the waiting area, this would be I'm waiting on Skype. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Okay. Whatever other calls we do I'm happy to call you. It might be a little bit easier. So this is, yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: How are you?
CLIENT: Oh, alright. Um. Could be better. (laughs) I'm a little sick because I got wet in the rain yesterday, in the monsoon rain, and it's been lots of hot and cold, hot and cold. Were you able to see if your camera worked? [00:01:15]
THERAPIST: Actually, you're not working either. I'm not seeing you either at the moment.
CLIENT: Yeah, let me turn that on. I don't look very good, so (laughs)
THERAPIST: That's okay. You know, I'm really sorry I have not been able to get it to work. I'm not really sure why.
CLIENT: It's alright. Yeah, I guess. Let me put something. (pause) It's been kind of a rainy day today so I just stayed at home. [I'm trying to recover] (ph), but it's not really making much difference. (sniffs)
THERAPIST: Yeah. Actually, I couldn't before but now it's better.
CLIENT: Okay. I'll try to lean a little bit more, but my back is kind of sore as well, (laughs) so. Yeah, I mean, I don't really (sniffs) (inaudible at 00:04:27) but I know that I'm really difficult and people who like me are very few and far between. But it still kind of comes as a shock when you realize ","P1-N400311":"that like they are dropping off like flies. (laughs) So (pause) I'm not really sure what [00:05:15]
THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?
CLIENT: What did you say? I didn't hear you.
THERAPIST: I said, "What are you thinking about?" (pause, static from bad Skype connection). Cecelia (ph), I can't tell if you're talking or not. We have a pretty bad connection. [00:18:54]
CLIENT: Oh. Can you hear me now?
THERAPIST: Yeah I can hear you now, but I couldn't hear what you were -
CLIENT: Yeah. No, I didn't say anything. I just was waiting for that wave of static to pass. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Got it. Got it. Yeah, I know our connection isn't as good today as it's been in the past.
CLIENT: Yeah, that's because I had another USB modem Internet that was faster. This one is a little slower. (sniffs)
THERAPIST: Oh. Got it.
CLIENT: But I'll be traveling next week anyway, so I think, yeah, I don't know if we'll be able to Skype in this month I think. (sniffs) So, but anyway. (laughs, sniffs)
THERAPIST: I was going to ask. Can you hear me? Cecelia (ph), can you hear me? (bad Skype connection, loud static background noise) [00:20:05]
CLIENT: I mean I know that -
THERAPIST: Cecelia (ph), can you hear me?
CLIENT: Yeah, I can hear you.
THERAPIST: Okay. Because I was saying, "Can you hear me?" before and it didn't seem like you could.
CLIENT: Oh. What did you say earlier? (laughs)
THERAPIST: Yeah. So, yeah, the connection is pretty bad today I think. Well one thing I asked is whether, you know, when you're saying that I had said that it did seem like you cheated on him, did you feel like I was judging you?
CLIENT: Well, yeah. I mean, but you're not a friend. I mean, we just (inaudible 00:20:45). It was kind of, it was neutral basically. It was more neutral than someone else, one of our mutual friends, pronouncing that judgment. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Well here's the thing now that I know you better and think about it more is that you know, I'm more, because there is certainly a part of you that didn't feel like you were being with another man sort of conflicted with your relationship with Chris (ph). So what I'm interested in is that fact.
CLIENT: Yeah. So much noise outside. Who am I? Can you repeat that last part? I'm sorry. [00:21:53]
THERAPIST: Well for you there's a sort of emotional reality that your relationship with Chris is separate than you're sort of sexual and romantic life.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I'm kind of thinking about it and I feel like, and maybe I'm articulating this for the first time. But I feel like even when I was with Chris (ph) all these past few years, I've always kind of kept a certain side of me separate from my relationship with him. (sniffs) I mean I didn't ","P1-N400891":"know such a side existed. It was there, I just didn't know about it until a few other things happened and certain other men came into the picture. [00:22:54]
THERAPIST: Huh. How does he bring legitimacy?
CLIENT: I feel a man is required to make you make you, a (inaudible at 00:29:26) legitimate. You know? Like he has parents. He has, right now I'm sitting in a flat in Istanbul, the cost of which is probably two hundred thousand dollars. (laughs) That brings solidity, right? I mean, I don't know. In ","P1-N400A11":"my head it does.
THERAPIST: I didn't hear that. I'm sorry Cecelia (ph). I didn't hear something about. You said "Something, something, two hundred thousand dollars." I didn't hear that.
CLIENT: Yeah. No, I'm saying I'm sitting in his flat in Istanbul and it probably costs that much because his parents, you know, bought the place in the eighties when it was much, much cheaper. I'm just saying like, you know, owning property, having parents, having a huge family all of whom would love ","P1-N400A51":"to have him at their wedding. (laughs) You know, and everything else.
THERAPIST: Cecelia, you have yourself.
CLIENT: What?
THERAPIST: You have yourself. [00:31:34]
CLIENT: I don't really trust myself that much. I don't know if I count for that much. (pause) (sniffs, pause) I don't think I can make that much of a difference by myself. Like I need someone like him to tell me, you know, "This is a worthwhile occupation. Do that." Or, "You're doing this great."
THERAPIST: Why not?
CLIENT: Well I guess, I mean, like I don't have family, I don't have real estate. (laughs) I feel like those two things really make people legitimate. You know? (pause) And doubt that (inaudible at 00:33:53] which is a house right now, I would feel very legitimate. (laughs)
THERAPIST: I think that's a good point. I think that you have an idea that if you had these other things you would somehow, they would bestow on you a feeling of legitimacy.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And that somehow you don't believe in and recognize your internal resources. Although sometimes you do. Like you were just talking about how you were able to support your mother and Chris (ph). And so sometimes you have a sense of your own sort of capacities and resources, but that gets lost very quickly.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause, static from bad Skype connection) Sorry, I was just waiting for the wave of static pass. (sniffs) [00:35:23]
THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. I got that.
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean you're right. Like I feel [sort of] (ph) precarious. Like I really do oscillate from feeling strong to feeling really just like a doormat or not having a spine. (sniffs) I'm not sure how to keep that from happening. (sniffs) I mean, I guess people have fears. They just somehow are ","P1-N400C51":"able to keep them at bay. You know?
THERAPIST: Cecelia (ph), I'm sorry I'm having a hard time hearing you.
CLIENT: Oh, I said I feel my job, I do feel my job is too easy and anyone can do it and I don't feel very proud about it. (sniffs) So I don't know if I've told you, but I think I've made a mess of it as well as everything else. I went part time a year ago to be able to spend more time on my writing ","P1-N400CF1":"and now they want me to come back, but obviously that position that I held has already been filled by this guy.
THERAPIST: But you're very caught between sort of wanting to pursue these sort of external reassurances and validation, and in wanting to pursue your own hopes and dreams and your own capacities and your own creativity. [00:40:57]
CLIENT: Yeah. Well because I know the people tell me that, you know, the externals are not going to go too far. You know, people might praise me, you know, one moment and then if they don't praise me the second moment I'm going to be down in the dumps. (inaudible Skype connection at 00:41:31)
THERAPIST: Cecelia (ph), can you hear me? (pause) Cecelia (ph), can you hear me? (inaudible Skype connection at 00:42:33)
CLIENT: All the confidence needs to come from within. It needs to be internal.
THERAPIST: You know, Cecelia (ph), can you hear me? (pause, silence, then sound of phone ringing) [00:43:02]
CLIENT: Can you hear me now?
THERAPIST: Yes, I can hear you now?
CLIENT: Do we have any more time or ?
THERAPIST: Actually we only have another minute or so. Are you going to have your modem back? You know, I'm so sorry, I didn't, for the last minute or so the screen was frozen. I didn't hear what you said.
CLIENT: Oh yeah. You know. Yeah, well I was just kind of exploring what you had said. But, yeah, I'll think about it more I guess in my own time. I will have that modem back actually.
THERAPIST: Oh great.
CLIENT: But I'm not sure if I mean, I'll be traveling starting Saturday and then that whole week I'll be traveling. (inaudible at 00:43:56) next week.
THERAPIST: Would you like to set something up for the following week or ?
CLIENT: The following Let me just open my calendar really quickly.
THERAPIST: That's the week of the thirtieth.
CLIENT: So, the following (Skype connection seems to have cut off here)
