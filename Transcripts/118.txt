DESCRIPTION: Client discusses feeling guilty for not spending more time with her family. Client also discusses feeling that she has to limit her contact with her mother, and general family, due to the constant negativity.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.
CLIENT: Hi. [pause] So I’ve been having an issue lately in thinking about am I having a problem with dealing with my mom when she starts to like bring up stuff that I don’t want to talk about. Like random—like a lot of stuff about obviously diet and her diet, and also a lot of like ","P1-N4000D1":"negative stories about people that I’m not necessarily still connected with, or know of, or like care to know about. And I’ve tried to express to her that I don’t want her—just to like change the subject, or I don’t want her to talk about this stuff, but she’s still ","P1-N4000D2":"doing it, which is making me realize, it’s like, I can’t change that. Someone might—her or anyone else might say or do something that is a trigger for me. I can only change the way that I—like whether or not I’m triggered by it or—
THERAPIST: Mm hm. You don’t spend Thanksgiving with your boyfriend or his family?
CLIENT: No he’ll—so he’ll be there, which is good, because if— The worst was like I went home a few times this summer and he couldn’t come with me, and I had more time off because of school, and that was very difficult for me. Because it’s easier if he’s there ","P1-N4001D1":"too because then he understands the situation and I have someone to like go escape with that can kind of help me rationalize my thoughts again and deal with the situation. Because he observes what happens and is very aware of what’s going on, so it’s very helpful for him to be there. But ","P1-N4001D2":"it’s still—it makes the problem a little better, but it doesn’t make it completely better, because it’s like that I’m-just-back-in-that-family dynamic again and it’s all—like all the same stuff.
THERAPIST: Okay. [12:30]
CLIENT: And I feel like in terms of overall awareness of actions that I have that are more like they have formed out of habit and they’re habits that I’m, you know, trying to break or trying to be more aware of these actions so that I don’t do them, all of that awareness seems to just ","P1-N400271":"like go away when I’m at home or with my fam—like on my own or with my family. It’s like I’ve always—I feel like everything I’ve worked for is just lost.
THERAPIST: I think ultimately when you feel you need them less it will be easier.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: The attachment is so intense right now.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And when you can tolerate—because it sounds like it’s not only your mom who has a hard time tolerating not having contact with you, you have a hard time not tolerating not having contact with her, it’s very painful for you.
CLIENT: Yeah. It’s—I feel guilty. It’s—it actually feels easier to not have contact with her. Like it makes things better because I feel like I’m in a better place when I don’t have contact, but I feel so guilty. Like I feel like I’m not there enough. And the ","P1-N400331":"last time I went home my sister screamed at me, telling me that I wasn’t there enough, and that I don’t go home enough, and that I’m not there for my family enough. [crying somewhat] And that was like really difficult. Because I feel like it’s really unhealthy for her, the amount ","P1-N400332":"that she’s there. And I feel like I’m healthier if I’m not around them as much, or—you know, to me it’s like I think talking to them once a week is fine. Because usually if I talk to my family more frequently, and particularly my mom, the stories she tells are actually ","P1-N400333":"the same, because it’s the same bad news story that she’s told again and again and she can’t remember who she told it to. [15:00]
THERAPIST: Why? If you go home twice why do you have to go to Christmas too? [16:50]
CLIENT: Well, it’s just the way we kind of rotate the—I mean, we could go to his family’s, but then I feel like—I feel like my family won’t like—because anything—a lot of times I would rather be with his family, because I really enjoy being around them and I ","P1-N400391":"don’t feel all this like stress. Like it’s just actually an enjoyable time. Like no one’s talking about weight, no one’s talking about like—and like no one’s speaking negatively about other people, like it’s kinda nice. But I feel like my family resents all ","P1-N400392":"the time I spend with his family, and I feel like they would give me so much guilt for not spending the holiday with them. [crying] And then I also feel like they would think that because—
THERAPIST: Oh, well, they will.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You’re talking about wanting to control all sorts of things you cannot control.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And try—and holding on so tight. Of course they want to believe it’s somebody else, they don’t want to believe it’s you.
CLIENT: Yeah. [19:00]
THERAPIST: “If but for this other person our daughter would be with us all the time.”
CLIENT: Yeah. That’s what it—and that’s why I laugh. I can’t— If my sister ever does date, because she has all kinds of issues from being around them so much, I like really wonder what would happen. Because right now I’m the one that’s getting all this blame ","P1-N4004B1":"and everything and my sister’s the good one, because she’s always there and always with them and always spending time with my grandparents. And I think that—so I feel like my grandparents will for the most part understand me not being there as much and want me to go have my own life ","P1-N4004B2":"and be happy, but I don’t feel like my parents feel that way. [20:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah, but [unclear] is if you wait for their permission you’ll be waiting forever.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, because I just… But the hard thing for me is I want to be with my boyfriend’s family more because they are so just accepting and I just, you know, love being with them so much more. But I don’t want to have any regret. [crying in earnest] I’m afraid that if ","P1-N4004F1":"something will one day happen to my parents that I’ll always feel guilty. [pause] Sorry.
THERAPIST: Please don’t be. You came to me for support.
CLIENT: [pause] So I don’t think that they’re aware of their actions enough to really—to really understand why I might be distancing myself. Like I think they’re totally unaware of how they’ve negatively affected me. And so I’m afraid that if I don’t help them ","P1-N400531":"more and spend more time with them and do all this stuff that I’ll feel some kind of a regret for—you know, for not having been there more, for not having [held\/helped? 22:13] them more. But at the same time my mom is like always taking care of my grandparents and it’s really negatively ","P1-N400532":"affected her because she feels the sense of guilt and everything. And I see what’s happened to her and I don’t want that to happen to me. And I don’t want to feel like the guilt. But it’s like still so there, especially when my sister gets angry with me, or, you know, says I’m ","P1-N400533":"not there enough. I just—it’s like the sense of guilt is so strong that I’m just afraid that—I’m afraid that if I don’t do more now that one day I’ll look back and say, “Oh, I shouldn’t have—” you know, I should have helped them more, ","P1-N400534":"I should have been there more, or I should have spent more time with them. [23:30]
THERAPIST: I almost get a sense when you’re talking it’s not only that you feel obligated to give something to them, but you almost feel compensate or make up for something.
CLIENT: Yeah. I think it’s—well, I think a lot of that though comes from the fact that I was always compared to my mom, and my mom is the one that does everything for everybody, and goes above and beyond, and has to do everything for my grandparents, and has to be the one to do everything. ","P1-N4005B1":"And so I think that I’m supposed to play that role, but I haven’t really been playing that role enough and I feel bad. And so I feel like I keep having—like I have to do more, and I’m not doing enough. And I feel like—I mean, I also feel like as they get older I really—I ","P1-N4005B2":"don’t want to do what my mom is doing. Like I don’t want to have to deal with them all the time and drop my whole life to take care of them, because I want to have my own life and I don’t want to negatively impact my life. And at the same time though I feel this guilt, and I feel that ","P1-N4005B3":"because they’re my parents you’re supposed—like that’s what you’re supposed to do. And you’re supposed to take care of your family, and you’re supposed to visit them and be there for them, and if you’re not then you’re a bad person. [27:15]
THERAPIST: So what are you thinking to do in telling her the good?
CLIENT: I don’t… It just sort of happens. But I think that I am trying to control her mood. Like I’m always trying to tell her to focus on the positive. And I have pointed out to her that she’s very negative, and I’ve told her I don’t want to talk negatively about ","P1-N400651":"other people. And I’ve said all of these things to her. And so I think that subconsciously I’m thinking, well, if I inundate her with all this great information then when she takes that and has a conversation with another person maybe she’ll tell them positive stuff, instead of only ","P1-N400652":"having negative information in her basket of stories that she has to tell people.
THERAPIST: But she doesn’t want to talk about positive stuff.
CLIENT: No. Yeah. That’s… The thing is like I’m—I think that’s the issue, is that even though I know that I can’t change my mom, or my dad, and their behaviors, I still—like I still think that I can. I know that I can’t, but I think maybe I can change ","P1-N400691":"them for the better. Because if I didn’t think that I don’t think I would be pointing things out to her, or trying to say to her like, “I don’t want to talk about this,” or I don’t… And so even though I know that they’re very set in their ways and very ","P1-N400692":"unaware of their own behavior, I think part of me still thinks that if I point stuff out I can change their actions. [32:45]
THERAPIST: You want to change them into the parents that you’d like them to be.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I think I feel like now—like oh, now that I have, you know, gotten through so much, and now that I’m so aware of—of my own actions, and of their behaviors, now that I know all of this can I help them, like can I help them to be better. But I know that they’re ","P1-N400771":"not receptive of that, and I know that they will never change. And I think coming to terms with that is really hard. Like coming to terms with the fact that this is who they are, that’s really difficult. [crying] Because… this is who they are, and it’s up to me to determine what I ","P1-N400772":"want my relationship with them to be. [39:00]
THERAPIST: I would too. [41:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. And I think that… I… I still, like I said, want them to just be aware of themselves and their behavior. Because I worry about one day when I have a family having them be around them, because there are certain behaviors they have that I wouldn’t want anyone else to pick ","P1-N4007F1":"up on or have to deal with. And so it’s really hard to also think like, “Oh, I may not want them to have a really big role in my child’s life, or I might…” That’s really hard to deal with, because I’ve always imagined my parents really, you know, being there, ","P1-N4007F2":"and through it all. But there are things that they do that I just don’t—I don’t want to be around and I don’t want other people to have to be around that, or, you know, pick up on that, or mimic those actions or behaviors. So I think that’s really hard to come to terms ","P1-N4007F3":"with too. Because the distance makes me feel okay, but there’s still that like guilt or that sadness that it couldn’t be better. Like why can’t it be that ideal relationship that other people have, and why does it have to be this way? I think there’s a lot of that feeling too.
THERAPIST: A lot of loss.
CLIENT: Mm hm. Like why couldn’t I have the parents that this person had, or the relationship that this person had. And they can have their parents—they can have all this other stuff, but I can’t have that because if I do it’s not really that healthy for me. So that’s really ","P1-N400831":"hard to come—to deal with. I think. [pause]
THERAPIST: And it will continue to be hard, and then it will be better. [43:30]
CLIENT: Yeah. And I think that it will be. And I can see myself getting there.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: But I think I’ll have to, you know, feel these feelings for a while, which is hard. But I know that it’s the best thing for me. But it’s… Like just navigating all the dynamics and the guilt coming from so many places is—it’s really hard.
THERAPIST: Well, I will help you navigate that.
CLIENT: Yes. And I—it’s like the stuff with my sister too, I want to have a close relationship with my sister, and I don’t. And I want to be one of those people that has a good relationship with their sister, but unfortunately my sister is too much like my parents, because she spends ","P1-N4008F1":"so much time with them and she isn’t necessarily aware of, you know, the negative effects that might be having. And so she’s kind of defending them or spouting their viewpoints very often. And so I try to reach out to her, and I want to have this relationship, and it’s not really there ","P1-N4008F2":"right now.
THERAPIST: Okay, I think we are going to need to stop.
CLIENT: All right.
THERAPIST: So then I’m not going to see you next week, but I’ll you the following week.
CLIENT: Yeah. [46:00]
THERAPIST: And in terms of scheduling, so right now I don’t have any availability on Mondays, I mean everything’s already booked.
CLIENT: Okay, okay.
THERAPIST: Tuesday, I usually have at least one Tuesday morning appointment, and at least one Tuesday late afternoon appointment at this point. And then a Thursday, I’ll have one or two appointments on Thursday.
CLIENT: Thursday could— So Tuesday I have an 8:30 class, and I think I have a lab that night. But Thursdays I have morning stuff, but I don’t have a lab, so if I can when she asks me about my work schedule and stuff that might be a good option probably.
THERAPIST: Okay. Okay, let me know, because right now I do.
CLIENT: Is it Thursday afternoon?
THERAPIST: Let me look at what my book actually.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Thursday, so I think—
CLIENT: Because she still has weekend. We’ve—I still haven’t worked out scheduling, so that is a good time probably now, just saying [unclear].
THERAPIST: And I do— So are we going to look at trying to find two times to meet? Is that the—
CLIENT: Well, for now I definitely obviously want to find one.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: I would like to find two, but I’m not sure. My schedule’s really terrible, so I’m not sure that it will work. But if we can find two that would be good.
THERAPIST: Are you able to come—so are you able to come on Wednesdays in general?
CLIENT: So my whole schedule changed, and Wednesdays now I have a lab at night for the next semester. Wednesday morning though. But I think up until like 10:30 again, because then I would have to go to school because I have class for the rest of the day.
THERAPIST: I may—yeah, I’m not— But right now my Wednesday mornings are full, but there might be an opening there.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: In that case. So Wednesdays before 10:30 are a possibility
CLIENT: Yes, are a possibility.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: And then—
THERAPIST: Thursday—so Thursday afternoon. Right now I have a 2:10.
CLIENT: That would work. Mm hm. [48:00]
THERAPIST: Okay. So that would work starting in January?
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: So I can just—do you want—I can hold that for you.
CLIENT: Yeah, that would be good. Because that way when I work out my schedule with her I can just kinda say, “Oh, that doesn’t work either.”
THERAPIST: Okay. So I will hold that for you starting on January.
CLIENT: Perfect, okay.
THERAPIST: And the other thing is—I don’t usually fill this tight. I could meet really early on Wednesday mornings until I have something that might come open at—I have a 7:10 time.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I don’t usually—I don’t usually fill that time regular, I usually do that for consultations.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But I could see you then. And then I do think that something before 10:30 will open up at some point and we can always switch.
CLIENT: Okay. Yeah, let’s do that.
THERAPIST: Does that sound good?
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: So I’ll put you in for both of those mornings—
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: —starting in January.
CLIENT: Yeah, that’s good.
THERAPIST: Great, okay. It sounds like—I’m glad it worked out.
CLIENT: Thank you. Yeah.
THERAPIST: Sure. And I will see you in two weeks.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And I wish you luck for Thanksgiving.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Bye bye.
CLIENT: Bye.
