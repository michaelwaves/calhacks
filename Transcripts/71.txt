DESCRIPTION: Client discusses going to a conference recently where he was reminded that he is not content with his life and wants it to be different. Client is conflicted by this, however, as it would mean leaving him marriage.
THERAPIST: Hi! Come on in!
CLIENT: Morning.
THERAPIST: Morning!
CLIENT: (pause) I can’t find what the right place to start is, but... Nothing of substance has changed in the intervening time since we’ve seen each other. I sent some applications out; I guess that’s something of substance that’s changed, so that’s a good thing. [00:01:08]
THERAPIST: (pause) But it doesn’t feel that way. It doesn’t feel like there is progress being made. [00:04:31]
CLIENT: Yeah. Or, yeah, and maybe that’s because I don’t have a clear sense of where any of it is going towards. You know, it’s progress, but... (chuckles) if you wandered through the desert, you can make a lot of progress and still not get anywhere. Not that... (pause) I guess I don’t ","P1-N4001B1":"have a particularly clear picture of where anything is headed, or where I actually want it to head. (pause) If doing a post-doc (ph) is a step along a particular career path that I’m doing, because... (pause) I like some aspects of the end career, but I sort of wonder, will I ever find something ","P1-N4001B2":"that I actually just like? Or is this all there is? You know like, some pieces of this, some parts of it are going to suck. That sort of describes my relationship also, with Tanya. [00:06:05]
THERAPIST: (pause) It sounds like you’re wondering, Is this all there is?
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I think that’s right.
THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?
CLIENT: Um... So, I’ve been sort of thinking about the set of problems that I have don’t really change from week to week, you know. It’s like, I can talk more about them, but you’ve already heard about all of them, you know more or less what they are. So, sort of thinking about ","P1-N400271":"the feeling of nothing changing over time, which is much less the sense that I have here, but is a sense that I have in our couples’ counseling.
THERAPIST: I’m not sure I understand.
CLIENT: That’s okay. I am not sure that I explained it with any clarity at all.
THERAPIST: (pause) I imagine that didn’t go over well with you, even if... internally, if not...
CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah, certainly internally. You know, I was confused as to what she was even talking about. What, because it... well, it tends to talk in a sort of more discreet fashion, at least in theory. Like, “What has it been like this week” is a question Dr. Jannis will often ask, ","P1-N4003B1":"which seems to make sense as a like, starting point for talking about what’s going on in our lives. So then in that context of like, what’s going on in the last week (chuckles)... So, yeah. [00:18:46]
THERAPIST: (pause) Did Tanya saying that annoy you?
CLIENT: (pause) It certainly perturbed me. I don’t know what the right word to attach to it is. You know, it sounded annoyed or not, but I feel like I sound frustrated, I certainly feel frustrated. (pause) I think part of the frustration I feel is like... (chuckles) It’s not at all clear ","P1-N4003F1":"to me what other incremental changes I should be making, or could possibly make, to make life okay for her, whatever the hell that means.
THERAPIST: (pause) Well, are you also feeling that you’ve just done enough? (pause) So much has already been asked of you, and you’ve just done enough?
CLIENT: So that phrase seems to imply that there is like, an end point in some ways. I feel more like...
THERAPIST: It’s not a sort of, necessarily, an end point. It’s a stopping point to see that something is happening with the resources you’ve invested before you continue.
CLIENT: Yeah, something like that, yeah.
THERAPIST: Well, it seems like, in addition to finances being very real, and a real problem in itself, that it’s also symbolic of feeling that you guys are, your needs are outweighing your resources, and has been leading you to get into debt, sort of symbolically as well as practically.
CLIENT: That’s a nice... yeah... analogy. (pause) Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because ostensibly, that problem will change, to some extent at least. I imagine that whatever, I know post-docs (ph) are not wildly high-paying jobs, but I assume you’re going to be more, you’re going to get more than before, so (client affirms), there will be some change. That ","P1-N400591":"problem will actually change. It might not completely go away, but it will get better, probably. So that’s helpful. It certainly doesn’t solve the “now,” and it’s also, there is also a larger issue. [00:24:20]
CLIENT: Yeah, and... Yeah, so I was thinking about all of these things, and being a very different way came to a sort of similar point, but without the nice analogies and the catharsis of saying all of those things to you. But part of the point is that some of these things are actually separable, so ","P1-N4005B1":"they feel the same, but like the money will actually get better sometime soon. So that brings back to like you were suggesting, many weeks ago now, but like... Some decisions are time-sensitive. I don’t need to find a job now, but I don’t need to decide what I’m doing with my relationship ","P1-N4005B2":"now, so...
THERAPIST: What does the frustration feel like? Can you describe it?
CLIENT: Probably not well. It feels like tension, it feels like there is a particular note that my voice gets when I’m very frustrated. You’ve recognized it, but I certainly hear it or feel it; it feels like that sound to me, which is... maybe one of the last clear things I’ve said ","P1-N400651":"today. Today has not been a particularly clear day. But maybe it feels sort of like that. You know, trying to give directions to someone who is visiting from a foreign country and doesn’t speak very good English, so you can’t tell where they’re trying to get to, and you can’t ","P1-N400652":"quite tell if they understand what you’re saying. It feels sort of like that.
THERAPIST: (pause) You’re describing a sort of feeling of repetitiveness or almost pointlessness. And I guess among the reasons I pointed out that your financial situation will change, at least somewhat, is just simply to say there are things that are actually are changing. They’re not just ","P1-N4006B1":"circling (client affirms) or cycling (client affirms), but they don’t... But I say that, not to try to take away from your feel , I understand that’s how you’re feeling. [00:30:10]
CLIENT: Thanks. I didn’t hear it either time that you said it or explained it that, like you were trying to take away from the feeling, more like you were trying to help me see beyond the feeling or something. Talk a lot about, I have this tendency to feel despair or to compare (ph), but the whole ","P1-N4006D1":"point of that is that there, that feeling is overwhelming, but there are things beyond it.
THERAPIST: Well, I don’t love this answer, because there is more to it than that, but I was thinking, “Well, why should the frustration go away? The frustration can hopefully help you solve the bigger problem.” (client affirms) If you just felt less frustrated about things in your ","P1-N4007D1":"life, that were overall troubling, where would the motivation be to do something about it? (client chuckles) Now does, yeah, so that’s not to say that frustration is only useful, but it’s also useful.
CLIENT: (chuckling) So a couple of years ago I was talking with my friend Cody, who... We were both living in Columbus at the time and talking about some discontent with particular features of the program. He was saying, “Well, maybe you shouldn’t be content. Maybe you’re not supposed ","P1-N4007F1":"to be content in these circumstances. That’s where change comes from, is people not being content with things that aren’t that good.” So, your advice, or your response reminded me of that. [00:36:48]
THERAPIST: Yeah, it’s very much in line with that.
CLIENT: There were some particular features of your phrasing that were superior to what he phrased it, because this... He didn’t quite mean it, but part of what he, it sounded like he was saying, it was like, “Well, maybe you should never be content, because someone’s got to change ","P1-N400831":"things, so, maybe your role is to just to be malcontent all the time,” which I don’t think is actually true. Yours was sort of more in response to the specific problems of... I don’t... I’m not happy with my life, and so the solution is not just to become okay with everything. ","P1-N400832":"It’s to pay attention to that and make the appropriate changes, I think, or something like that. [00:37:33]
THERAPIST: Yeah, along those lines, the thought about some of the frustration... This isn’t quite right, but I was just thinking that sometimes you have this feeling, when you’re really in a despairing mode (which I’ve seen you in), is just hearing like things are just unsalvageable. ","P1-N400851":"It’s not unsalvageable. The question is, what do you want to salvage? (client chuckles) And you don’t want to salvage everything. You also feel that way. So it’s not unsalvageable, and it’s not that you want to salvage everything. So the question is, what is the most important ","P1-N400852":"things for you to salvage, and then how?
CLIENT: Yeah, that’s a really interesting way of describing it. I think it’s right. It’s also terrifying.
THERAPIST: Hmm. How so?
CLIENT: (pause) Um, I’m not exactly sure, but it’s in that idea of like, you don’t want to salvage everything. What are the important things to salvage? (pause) I think there is a part that is afraid of making those choices.
THERAPIST: I think that’s right. Which I think leaves you just feeling like, I have just the same problems I did. You know, it’s sort of a, they’re related.
CLIENT: Yeah, because in some ways, at the root of all of it, it’s like, I have to make some choices about what I want to salvage and what I don’t. I don’t really want to make those choices.
THERAPIST: Why not? [00:39:44]
CLIENT: Um... (pause) I don’t know that I know, but some things that come up are fear of loss, and fear of hurting other people, and... I don’t know, other than that. I feel like there is probably more to it than that, but...
THERAPIST: (pause) Well, that’s what’s ultimately going to change, or going to have to change for something to change, because you were saying before, the problems aren’t changing (client affirms), which you know, has input, (inaudible) not entirely true. There are some problems that ","P1-N4009B1":"are changing, but...
CLIENT: Well, it started with that, so... [00:41:43]
THERAPIST: Right. But ultimately, what’s going to change is what you about the problems you have. And that’s a big change, what you do about them, and how you handle them differently will change those problems, and it will very much will. (client affirms) It’s not, sort of, these are ","P1-N4009F1":"just the problems and this is, this is, you know, what life gives you and that’s it.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think part of the frustration comes from some of the problems, the easy problems, I know how to handle like, the money problems. There is no difficult problem there like, eventually I’ll make more money and they’ll go away, so... But I think you’re pointing at the deeper ","P1-N400A11":"problems, I think that is partly right.
THERAPIST: Um... I feel like I could answer that in very specific ways and more general ways. In a very general sense, how you take ownership. I think what needs to change for you to feel better is to take more ownership over decisions in your life and feel less, “This just sucks and I, this just ","P1-N400A71":"sucks.” Because it doesn’t... That leaves you very stuck.
CLIENT: Thank you for that.
THERAPIST: Okay, take care.
