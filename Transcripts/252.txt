DESCRIPTION: Client struggles to find a way to just accept her life as it is. She feels like she victimizes herself, always looking for the negative aspects of her life. They discuss a dream she had recently.
THERAPIST: Hi. [0:04:56]
CLIENT: Sorry. (pause)
THERAPIST: How are you?
CLIENT: Fine, thank you. (sneezes) Excuse me.
THERAPIST: Bless you. (pause)
CLIENT: I had (inaudible at 0:05:48) my nice yesterday. Let's see, school is over for the semester but I wanted longer. [0:06:06] It probably kind of feels like I miss that structure.
THERAPIST: Are you looking for someone to replace you too?
CLIENT: I cannot because...
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: I cannot do anything because they are the ones who have to live with the person.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: So I'm not allowed to do anything. I mean, I know I signed the lease. I'm responsible for the rent and obviously I'll pay it. But it just makes me feel a little bad for so they're all they reject to get a lot of interest. But then they reject people. And one of the guys they rejected because ","P1-N400271":"he was upset that they that people mispronounce his name. I don't know. (chuckling) [0:09:01]
THERAPIST: That's true.
CLIENT: Yea. And I was asking him. But I was like (inaudible at 0:13:00) because he knew this girl too. [0:13:02] And I was like, "So just to make this clear. You have absolutely you feel absolutely nothing negative when I tell you about her entry." He's like, "Yea, I don't." And I'm like, "Wow." ","P1-N400331":"I'm like totally insecure. And you're like and I mean, he's like, "No. I know what I have to get done." And I'm like, "How can you not feel like what you're doing might not be as significant or as popular as what she's doing? And you don't think that way." It's like, well, I wish I could be just a ","P1-N400332":"little bit like that. (pause) Will I always be insecure? Or will I be able to feel a little secure in myself?
THERAPIST: You're not sure. [0:14:01]
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: You're not sure.
CLIENT: No. Right now, I'm not.
THERAPIST: Because you're feeling especially insecure?
CLIENT: Yea, I guess. I mean, I'm sure I I'm trying to think if there were times in my life where I was less insecure. But I don't know. I might have been. But I might have still been insecure about other things. Even as a child or something. (pause)
THERAPIST: That's quite a change.
CLIENT: Is it? It's a small I don't know. I want to be like it's there. But I do. I mean, I was feeling I was very, very sad yesterday. I mean, sad enough to cry and not even realize that I'm out in public. (chuckling) But yea, today I wouldn't feel like crying. (chuckling) And I don't know. (pause) [0:18:01]
THERAPIST: Well, it's also the reason you seek him out.
CLIENT: Yea. Yesterday I had this dream that and this is like I never dream about him so it's very strange but I had this dream that we were in the room. In this place that looks very normal. But it's a game where it's some horror movie. Where you lift things or they lift on their own. [0:20:02] ","P1-N4004F1":"And there's a glass or something. And I was behind when he was putting those things out because he knew how to do it. Or maybe it stems from us playing Angry Birds too much. But I don't know. (chuckling) I don't know.
THERAPIST: So can you say the dream again?
CLIENT: Oh, just stuff you lift stuff. And there's a glass or something horrible happens. And I was on his arm and I was next to him. And he was going ahead and diffusing the stuff. Or doing it the right way because he knew how to.
THERAPIST: Diffuse the explosion?
CLIENT: Yea. (chuckling)
THERAPIST: And what were like what was the explosion was like in a box?
CLIENT: I don't know. It was like furniture or something that suddenly it looks like furniture. But as soon as you go close or do something, it changes. [0:21:06] It was deceptive stuff. It looked normal. But as soon as you did something, it changed and became like yea, harmful. (chuckling) Something ","P1-N4005B1":"scary popped out or something. But that was just one of the dreams. I have other dreams too in which he wasn't there.
THERAPIST: Do you remember those?
CLIENT: Oh, yea. (chuckling) I was just I had the ability to fly. (chuckling) It was weird but so it's like Google Maps. Do you do that sometimes? I just sometimes just plop myself down on some corner of the street. And that images view where you can actually see the street level view. [0:22:05] ","P1-N4005F1":"And then you just go from one point to one point. And then you're able to see the whole street like that. So it was like that.
THERAPIST: What was the feeling in the dream?
CLIENT: I don't know. I was just like, "Oh, I'm flying." I don't know that I was surveying stuff. I don't know. I can't describe it.
THERAPIST: What was your relationship with the actor?
CLIENT: (chuckling) I think it was sexual. It's very weird and rare for me to have that kind of a dream. But yea, he was holding me in his arms or something. Isn't that weird? After I had that dream, I I don't know. I think I had that dream after the walking into the deceptive living room with (David). [0:24:06]
THERAPIST: What do you make of it?
CLIENT: I'm crazy? No, maybe not that. (chuckling)
THERAPIST: That's interesting.
CLIENT: (laughing) No. I mean, I'm sure you've heard crazier dreams in your profession. But no, I mean, I need (David) through his guidance, yea.
THERAPIST: That's what comes to mind?
CLIENT: Yea.
THERAPIST: Needing (David)?
CLIENT: Yea. And for the first time maybe letting him be letting him take care of me, letting him lead me. I don't know what I feel about that because I thought I would want to do it myself. Take care of stuff myself. [0:25:02]
THERAPIST: I mean, it sounds like the dream with the sort of sexual relationship with that actor came after.
CLIENT: I don't know why. It was a totally unexpected because I was just having a very innocent dream about flying.
THERAPIST: So the flying came first? [0:26:00]
CLIENT: Yea. I think I might have seen my mom also. She was teaching or something in a school. And then I just started flying from there. (chuckling)
THERAPIST: What did it feel like?
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: To fly. What did it feel like?
CLIENT: A bit scary. A bit weird but normal and exciting. Imaginative. And also I guess a little, yea fun and dangerous and being sly. And because I kept telling myself, "Of course, I'm invisible. No one can see me." So...
THERAPIST: So you were flying and you were invisible? Or you were just high up?
CLIENT: I don't know. It's like the Google Maps thing. [0:27:01] You feel it's yea. It was pretty close because of the ground and buildings. I don't know. But then in the with the actor, I was visible.
THERAPIST: You were visible?
CLIENT: Yea. (pause)
THERAPIST: Did you feel free?
CLIENT: I guess. I felt just like I was doing something that I wasn't supposed to. [0:27:59] Or I was doing something that people I don't know might find weird if they knew about it. Or not like it or something like that. But yea, it was freeing.
THERAPIST: This was this is a very (Cecelia) piece thing to say. You start elaborating on it. You have an idea and then you stop. And then you ask me. [0:29:05]
CLIENT: No. Because I'm saying I'm telling that, for me, it's something that's full of anxiety so I'm not really sure if that is freedom or if it's not.
THERAPIST: Whether freedom and anxiety could go together?
CLIENT: I guess they do. But I'm saying, for me, they do. I haven't asked other people if that's the thing for them too. (pause)
THERAPIST: What do you make of the looking for (Victor's) street?
CLIENT: My obsession with him as (David) puts it. (pause) [0:30:01] Yea, this is so much crap attached to that whole thing. It's just so weird. Yea, the best everyone is doing are just ignoring it and nothing can matter again.
THERAPIST: So there was a confusion of time in the dream too?
CLIENT: No, no, no. Oh, yea. Maybe you're right, yea.
THERAPIST: In that piece anyway.
CLIENT: Yea. Well, yea. I'm not sure what time it was. [0:33:04] I just assumed that what that meant was like it's still today. But this guy this actor still looks like what he did when I actually used to have a crush on him as a ten year old or something. I don't know.
THERAPIST: Do you think that's the relationship with (Victor) too? That this sort of kind of love like comfort thing you're looking for feels like a younger your younger self too?
CLIENT: I don't know. I guess love makes you feel younger.
THERAPIST: Well, I was coming on the nonsexual piece. I was thinking you were struck by the fact that it didn't feel like a sexual relationship. And almost like a friend or even a parent like just that comfort.
CLIENT: Yea. [0:34:02]
THERAPIST: And so you associate it to be ten when the actor was the age he was so I wondering if you in the dream were sort of a younger person looking for something comfort or love?
CLIENT: I don't know if I was younger. Maybe I was a little younger. I don't know. I never pay attention to my age in my dreams. I don't know if other people do. But yea, I come across I never thought about it but I think I come across as a girl child. Not really a woman but that's because I don't ","P1-N400BD1":"think of myself as a woman. I don't know when I will. But I was flapping my arms and my arms looked pretty thin so I was like, Yea, this could be a younger me." Or... [0:35:00]
THERAPIST: How would that happen that you would ruin your dreams?
CLIENT: Just not being able to work. And I'm just constantly thinking about him and stuff, I guess. I'm trying that's what I'm trying not to do that. I don't but I do think about him. But it's I don't try to contact him. Because then I'll just be like, "Oh, has he replied?" Or if I might want ","P1-N400C71":"to see him, then I'd be like, "Oh, does he want to see me?" And when and in what condition and if I see him then I'll be like, "Oh, are we going to get back together or not?" [0:38:03] And it's just going to be it's going to waste too much time. So weeks, months I don't really have that shouldn't ","P1-N400C72":"do that right now at this stage. (pause)
THERAPIST: What do you think the explosives represented?
CLIENT: I don't know. Well, now that I'm describing the dream, I'm struck by the whole deceptive aspect of the things. They looked normal. And maybe that's how I feel like stuff comes across as you know, "Oh, I can deal with this situation." And but then it explodes in my face. [0:39:01] Or it scares ","P1-N400CB1":"me. It was scarier than explosives. It was more like I don't know it might change into a ghost or witch or something. And...
THERAPIST: Things are not what they seem.
CLIENT: Yea. And then it was like a game. I don't know, maybe in a haunted house or something or not really because everything was bright and stuff. But then you go up close and then just kind of change. And I didn't know how to deal with it or (David) was dealing with them for me. So yea. [0:40:01] ","P1-N400CF1":"(pause) I mean... (pause)
THERAPIST: You see it but you can't shine.
CLIENT: Yea. I guess. Because then I was flying on my own and I see what you mean about it being liberating. It was. [0:43:05] I mean, it was also it was a twinge of anxiety with it. Not that Oh, my God. I'm going to fall. I don't think I felt that. But I just do I know what I'm doing? That kind of thing.
THERAPIST: So there's an anxiety about having the freedom.
CLIENT: Yea. I mean, it's just like what I said so often here. That OK, I have 45 minutes. What do I say? How do I say it?
THERAPIST: What do you do with the open space?
CLIENT: Yea. And yea, it was in an urban space. I was I had my roots. Like I said on it was like Google Maps. [0:44:02] It was really from point A to point B. I actually remember thinking that, "OK, from now I'm going to fly from this street and street to that to the end of that street which is ","P1-N400E11":"where (Victor's) house is," or something like that. It was very structured and oriented. It was not open space and on top of an ocean or something. (chuckling) (pause) [0:45:01]
THERAPIST: You know, (Cecelia), we're going to need to stop for today. So I will see you next Wednesday and next Friday.
CLIENT: OK, sounds good.
THERAPIST: OK? And that will give us one (inaudible at 0:45:48).
CLIENT: Merry Christmas.
THERAPIST: Oh, thank you very much, same to you. Take care.
CLIENT: You too.
THERAPIST: Bye.
CLIENT: Bye.
