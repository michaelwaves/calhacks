DESCRIPTION: Client's upcoming wedding is stirring up family drama and leading to fights with his father. Client's father did not stand up to his sister or mother, which has led the client to be emotionally scarred about his childhood.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in! (pause) I just wanted to let you know, I appreciate the check from last week. So, that covered through the end of September, but not last session, just to let you know. Just wanted to let you know that, because it didn't cover the missed session.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So you know what I'm saying? So, you covered it through the end of September, but not last session.
CLIENT: Okay, so next I owe you three?
THERAPIST: Yeah. So, yeah. I mean, that's totally fine, I just wanted to let you know. From an accounting standpoint, we usually... yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah, I do, too. Okay, so now I owe you three. Okay. Perfect.
THERAPIST: So, in realizing that, like his sister isn't his safety net, what do you think he fears?
CLIENT: I don't know. And that's what I don't understand. I don't know what he fears. I don't know what he's looking for out of the relationship. (sighs) I mean, I don't know what, you know, me and my siblings and my mother have to do to prove that we're on his side, that we do want what's best for ","P1-N400251":"him. Everything we're trying to do with him is in a positive way, it's in a way to help better his life; where before, you know, when I was working at the company, it was that one thing that was holding me back. [00:07:22]
THERAPIST: Well, sometimes, people don't stand up for themselves in relationships because they're afraid of losing that person.
CLIENT: Well, and that's what he said. He said to me, because I, you know, I asked him and, you know, we had a conversation. There was no yelling and screaming, but we had a conversation about how I really would not like them to be a part of my wedding. And he came back with, "Well, I don't want to ","P1-N400331":"lose my sister." [00:11:20]
THERAPIST: What did he say?
CLIENT: He didn't say anything. He just sat there in silence, upset. I knew that he was upset, because he just sat there. And it was kind of awkward a little bit, but that's... (sighs) that's how I'm slowly letting go of my feelings, because I want him to know where I stand. I understand this is going ","P1-N400391":"to be a difficult process. I understand he's not going to like what I have to say, but I feel I have to let him know where I'm coming from. I can't be holding anything back anymore. I can't be just putting it on the back burner and making these, you know, fake smiles that everything's okay; I can't ","P1-N400392":"do it. Mentally I can't do it, emotionally I can't do it; but I can let him know how I feel. [00:13:08]
THERAPIST: What was it like, to see him like that?
CLIENT: It was kind of a relief, because he was actually thinking about it. You know, I think he was boiling, but I think he was actually processing what was going on. I think, you know, hopefully, it sunk in, how hurt me and my siblings really are because of this, how, you know, difficult it is for ","P1-N4003D1":"us to watch him get pushed over, have this man constantly pushing his other children on us, that aren't even related to me by blood, you know? I think it started to all process, because I also mentioned to him that I do want to have a conversation with my aunt and uncle, and explain to them their role ","P1-N4003D2":"in my life, which is non-existent. [00:14:09]
THERAPIST: That's not clear, if it's a funeral or a wedding!
CLIENT: No, no, I know. But I told my mother and I told my siblings, if something happened to my Aunt Trish, I would not be in attendance. I don't have that connection. I only went for my grandmother's for my dad. That was it. If something happens to his sister, I don't care.
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you're not only, or maybe even really making a statement about your cousins and your aunt. You're making a statement to your dad, in particular, about his loyalty.
CLIENT: Well, that's the... and ultimately, I don't want it to be, but it is a choice, because I do want to see where he stands, whether it's with me or her.
THERAPIST: Well, I don't think they would bother you as much if you felt that your father was on your side and took your side.
CLIENT: I really 100% agree.
THERAPIST: So it seems like in some sense, like, it's not exactly about them. It's about how he, what he does, based on who they are and how they've treated you.
CLIENT: Yeah. And how they treat him. I mean, it's all about... and I know I don't, you shouldn't use this word, but it's about a justification. It's a concrete of why this is happening. I just want him to be able to see my side, my siblings' side, my mother's side. I want him to experience that, because ","P1-N400551":"throughout all those years, he really wasn't that person, because he always turned a blind side, because it was his mother and his sister that were the ones doing it. He always turned a blind side to that. [00:19:47]
THERAPIST: Do you feel like when he was upset that he... do you feel that that indicated that he understood something about what you were talking about, or not?
CLIENT: It triggered something. Do I know what he was thinking? No. Because I never actually had this conversation about how I truly felt, about how hurt I was. I really don't... He never understood that. And as much as he wanted to think he saw it, he never did, because his children never spoke of ","P1-N400591":"this until now. Now is when everything is coming out, now is when all the dust is starting to settle and all the pieces are falling into place, because before I never had the courage or the confidence to speak out about it. I always talked a big game, but never did it. [00:20:42]
THERAPIST: Do you feel like getting it now will make up for some of those past experiences?
CLIENT: Make up for it? No. But moving forward, comfort me a little bit more, make me more loving? Yes. Because there is always...like I said, you know, I don't know if I mentioned this, I can't fix the past. I can forget it or try to forget it, but I can't fix it. So if I can get that support now, ","P1-N400671":"or just a show of it, and have them understand it, maybe they can change now to help me live a better rest of my life. Because if they don't see it... (sighs), I'm running out of patience. I'm running out of cries, calls for help. I feel like I've tried numerous times to ask for the emotional support ","P1-N400672":"that I needed, the reinforcement of positivity, the reinforcement of helping me as an individual. I really do feel like I needed that support, and I never got it. I feel like I've never gotten it. And that's what's frustrating. [00:26:27]
THERAPIST: And it feels like your father taking sides will help you feel more supported?
CLIENT: It will give me, at least in the back of my mind, I will truly know that he is on my side, because right now, I feel he's not. Right now, I feel he's on his sister's side. And that's bothered... that bothers me, because here I am, someone who has done nothing to hurt you, who's done nothing, ","P1-N4006B1":"but try to be supportive, try to help you, love you; and here is the person who constantly abuses you, steals from you, makes your life more miserable than it needs to be; and that's who you're choosing. [00:27:22]
THERAPIST: What do you think that something is?
CLIENT: The emotional attachment that I've been looking for, the emotional support I've been waiting for, the emotional support that I've been so long and been crying out for so long. I think that's what's finally hitting. [00:31:13]
THERAPIST: So they're contacting you to tell you they support you?
CLIENT: No, my brothers and sisters are contacting me, telling me my parents are upset over my comments.
THERAPIST: I see. So, but it sounds like that feels like support to you.
CLIENT: No. It's not support to me. It's, to me, it's comfort, knowing that they're thinking about it.
THERAPIST: Got it.
CLIENT: They're processing what I've said.
THERAPIST: You got their attention.
CLIENT: For once.
THERAPIST: Got it.
CLIENT: The problem is keeping that attention, because they can get easily distracted and try to fight to avoid it. I have their attention; now I need them to listen. That's the hardest part, is getting them to listen, because they tend to do their own thing. My mother does whatever my dad wants, and ","P1-N4008B1":"my dad wants to dictate everything. That's not happening anymore. He's not dictating anything; not to me, at least. [00:32:13]
THERAPIST: What I was going to say, you made a comment earlier in this session, that you feel like you, now, like that, you or your father are in the same position; like you understand how your father feels, because of what he's going through with his sister. How did you mean?
CLIENT: How did I mean?
THERAPIST: Yeah, how did you mean (blocked)?
CLIENT: I meant the situation, how... where I'm constantly calling out, and even though bad things are happening to me, even though situations are not healthy and outsiders see it, and I constantly complain (like my dad constantly complains about his sister and her actions and her husband's actions), ","P1-N400991":"whereas I was constantly complaining about work and the actions of my aunt and uncle and the actions of my grandmother, and the actions of my aunt; he does that constantly with his sister, I did it constantly with my aunts and uncles and my grandmother. That's where the relationship, you know, kind ","P1-N400992":"of coincides, is because we're all just, instead of acting on it, we sit and indulge in it and complain about and let it eat us away, mentally and emotionally. I'm just like, "How can she do this, what is wrong with them? We're your family; why are you doing this to me?" [00:35:15]
THERAPIST: Right; but agreement in what... I'm not sure I understand (blocked)
CLIENT: Agreement in, we both go our separate ways.
THERAPIST: You mean you in one way, and your parents in another?
CLIENT: No. Me and my parents this way, and my aunt and her family that way.
THERAPIST: Right. I see.
CLIENT: You know? Because it's really tampering with... you know, my mother is obsessed with my aunt. She's obsessed. And I just don't want that, for her own safety, for her own health.
THERAPIST: What if that doesn't happen? What would happen instead?
CLIENT: Unfortunately, I'd slowly sneak my way out of the picture. I would. I would sneak my way out of the picture. I wouldn't do it abruptly, just, very fast; it would be very slow and it would be to the point where I wouldn't see anyone on my dad's family; and I'd have no problem with that. I'd have ","P1-N400AD1":"no problem with that. [00:37:58]
THERAPIST: What about your dad? Would you see him?
CLIENT: Yeah, by himself, with my immediate family, my brothers and my sisters. But any big family around, that has them there I'm away. I'm away. I'm done with it.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess it's important to sort of identify who it is you're angry at. I mean, it sounds like you're really angry at him.
CLIENT: Well, I'm not angry; I'm frustrated. I'm not angry at him. I'm just frustrated, because he just doesn't see emotionally what we see.
THERAPIST: Well it sounds like, was it your aunt... whose stepson, who... was in that...
CLIENT: My dad's sister's stepson.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you felt that she and her husband really looked out for their kids in a way that your dad didn't look out for you. I guess that's what I meant by angry, but maybe that was the wrong word. [00:39:00]
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And that's what I expressed to him. How they fought and fought and fought for him, and I never got that for me. I never even got an ounce of that. And that's when the conversation went quiet. That's when it went quiet, because, I think he knows now; well, not knows, but he's thinking ","P1-N400BD1":"about it. "Shit! I really didn't do that! My kids are seeing this, this is how my kids are feeling." We are feeling left out. I do. I feel left out. So if I'm left out, why am I going to try to fit in? I already know I don't!
THERAPIST: Do you think he knows?
CLIENT: No. (pause) No. (pause) And that's what's even more frustrating and more painful and more emotionally angering me, getting me all worked up, because I don't think he sees he did anything wrong. He doesn't, and I know... that's the one thing that, you know, I feel for in my heart, in my gut, ","P1-N400C91":"because I know that's his answer; he didn't know what he was doing. It's frustrating, very frustrating, you know? It's just something that (sighs)... until he can come to grips with, you know... he was a part of the reason why we were hurt as kids, it's just a question that's just going to keep burning ","P1-N400C92":"at me. It's going to keep bothering me, and I don't know how my siblings feel about it, but I feel very strongly for it. I feel very strongly that, you know... because they weren't... (sigh)... [00:44:09]
THERAPIST: You can curse, if you want.
CLIENT: I'm sorry, I would go over there in a fury.
THERAPIST: And protect her.
CLIENT: And protect her. And tell her that that's not called for, and that until you apologize, until you can understand how bad you hurt her, you're out. You're out! I feel that he let it happen, she got a slap on the wrist, and we were still out. [00:45:35]
THERAPIST: Well, this is some pretty heavy stuff, and it seems like we have a lot more to talk about. We are going to need to stop today, Blaise (ph?), okay?
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I look forward to hearing how things are going, okay?
CLIENT: Thank you, Dr. Stevenson (ph?). Talk to you.
THERAPIST: Okay, take care.
