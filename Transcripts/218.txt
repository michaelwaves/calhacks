DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her issues with her socioeconomic status, even though she chose to get another degree. Client discusses her confusion over which man she loves.
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in. [00:00:38]
CLIENT: This is what I was thinking. (Sneezes) That what we talked about on Monday, like valuing others and undervaluing myself. (Pause) I guess I was wondering if my relationship with Chris (sp?) didn’t work out because I started undervaluing myself. That was the biggest reason. Not that there ","P1-N4000F1":"has to be just one reason, but I guess in terms of understanding something, understanding is (inaudible at 00:06:48). I’m sure there are more reasons. (Chuckles) I guess I was trying to see if that’s what happened those three years that I wasn’t (ph) in good shape.
THERAPIST: When you say, “That’s how.” What’s how? What are you referring to?
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: You said, “That’s how you know your place in the world.” When you say “That’s how,” what…
CLIENT: Well, you compare and you like, hierarchize and place yourself in comparison to others.
THERAPIST: Well, it’s not something that you compare, which I think is a problem in many respects, but that you’re always in the unfavorable position.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, it’s logistically the case. Right? Yesterday at school I’m sitting and eating lunch with Chris (sp?) and his friend and both are professors and I’m a student in the same institution. And I’m complaining about my bill that I haven’t paid. I don’t ","P1-N4001F1":"have… $300 is too much for me. So that’s just logistically the case. Obviously I’m going to feel small next to these guys who are constantly just talking about tenure and how this person makes $90,000 but this other person makes $110,000 because he was hired five years later. You know? ","P1-N4001F2":"And then they close the difference of 15 (ph). So it’s all there. It’s not just in my head. [00:11:15]
THERAPIST: I don’t know how that relates to anything though. You’re making it mean something that I don’t really understand.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: But what does that say about anything? What does it say that you’re a student? Why does that reflect anything on you? Bad, good?
CLIENT: I don’t know. It makes me feel small and makes me not want to sit at the same table with them. (Laughs)
THERAPIST: But you chose this. You already have 2 masters. You already have the degree that you’re pursuing.
CLIENT: Yeah. But I had my reasons doing this.
THERAPIST: I know. But then you’re saying that, “I’m only a lowly student.” Well, you chose to get a third masters.
CLIENT: (Chuckles) I know that. [00:12:14] (Pause)
THERAPIST: I guess I’m putting that out that you do have things that these other people, at least some of the things that these other people do have and can get the things that these people have. But somehow that just kind of gets washed away.
CLIENT: What gets washed away?
THERAPIST: The fact that you do have degrees already and you could be making more money if you wanted to. You’re just choosing not to.
CLIENT: Yeah. I know that. (Chuckles) (Pause) I don’t know. It just makes me want to run and hide. (Laughs) That’s like my first reaction. Only reaction.
THERAPIST: If you feel you’re at a point in life that you don’t want to be a student anymore, that you want to have a different status, you could choose that too. You certainly don’t need to be a student anymore if you don’t want to. It’s not like you’re getting a ","P1-N400391":"degree you absolutely need to get and you’re just sort of very low on the ladder because of it.
CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. (Pause)
THERAPIST: I guess what you’re saying is, “Look at how lowly I am, given how much more status and stature these other people have,” and I’m sort of saying, “Quit complaining and just go get it then.”
CLIENT: Chuckles
THERAPIST: If it’s that important to you.
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I’m also trying to tell myself that this decision has given me so much more time to write, which I didn’t have earlier, which I was dying for. So I should remember that and I should remember every day. Every day that I am writing. And I do. I make a note on my calendar, ","P1-N400431":"“I wrote these many hours.” I should just constantly keep looking at that. And yet, coming out of (inaudible at 00:15:26) and all, but I chose it for a reason.
THERAPIST: Do you feel that he’s preoccupied with how much people make?
CLIENT: I don’t know. I feel like I know him pretty well and he’s not at all money-minded.
THERAPIST: You do bring about a lot that you guys talk about peoples’ salaries, which people do talk about that but it’s not like something that’s very common that people talk about often.
CLIENT: Yeah. No, but I think he was just kind of find out that it matters when you get hired. That was the context. [00:16:28]
THERAPIST: That your starting salary matters?
CLIENT: Yeah. That if you’re hired 5 years later, [maybe somehow and you] (ph) negotiate well. He would write me a check for however much I ask him for in the sense that he doesn’t care about money. He’s not like Nelson (sp?). You know? Who is totally like that. (Laughs) (Pause)
THERAPIST: Well, even if people around you don’t, you need a certain amount to live on.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I can take care of myself, so… (Sighs) Whatever. It’s temporary. I keep telling myself that. It’s temporary. (Pause)
THERAPIST: It’s an important topic.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it is subjective. It changes from time to time. I guess I still feel like I can hear my friend’s voice saying, “You’re a destructive maul (ph).” I don’t know what exactly her context was with it.
THERAPIST: Is that what you felt she was saying?
CLIENT: Yeah. I’m sure she wasn’t saying that, but that’s what I heard. Like, I have this narrative in my head that Chris (sp?) is great. He’s upright and he’s upstanding; he’s moral and he’s kind. I love him. He loves me. Just quit complaining as you were saying ","P1-N400631":"earlier and be with him. (Pause) And that, just like the rebel in me is like, “No. If I’ll be with him, I won’t sleep with him.” Or I just, “Oh, find him attractive.” Which pretty much is what happens all the time.
THERAPIST: What are you thinking about? [00:25:27]
CLIENT: Just what more to say about this? (Laughs)
THERAPIST: Well, in a very broad way you’re trying to figure out whether that some of the things that you find attractive or don’t, whether they’re changeable or not. You know, whether it’s sort of your mindset about your not finding men attractive because he’s too kind ","P1-N4006D1":"to you or something that you can work through versus you know, some people are just less attractive to people; and I guess you can find your reason for it but it’s not exactly anything that you can change. [00:26:41]
CLIENT: What can you not change?
THERAPIST: Attraction for example. It’s an interesting question. Is there a way in which we can understand some of the things that do and don’t attract other people that are changeable because they’re based on conflict or whatever? Versus just some people you just find attractive or ","P1-N400711":"not. Even if we find a reason for it, it doesn’t change the fact that you’re either attracted to them or not.
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean… because ultimately or soon I feel like I should make a decision about whether [ph] I want to spend the rest of my life.
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: Why not?
THERAPIST: You may not have met the person you should spend the rest of your life with.
CLIENT: Well, I’ve not much time.
THERAPIST: What’s the time limitation? [00:28:19]
CLIENT: I’ve known Chris (sp?) for 10 years now. His parents have been asking about marriage for a long time now. I made the excuse, “Oh, I’m going to finish my book first.” Well, that might be happening soon too so then what’s my excuse then? I feel like I could see myself ","P1-N400811":"married and having children. That requires that I make a commitment to one person. (Laughs) I’m like so far from doing that with Chris because things are so up in the air. I’m involved with someone else and not just involved as like, “Yeah, we see each other,” but actually have ","P1-N400812":"feelings for him too. I feel like, marriage wise, things are muddled (ph). [00:29:27] (Pause)
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like that wasn’t only your friend’s voice; that your mother used to tell you that.
CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) I would just say, “You’re just not satisfied with me. You’re just not satisfied sexually (ph) or whatever.” “I’m not like that. [I’m like a pretty mild guy] (ph). I’m perfectly happy staying at home cooking a meal and that’s ","P1-N4008B1":"it.” No, I hate that. I want to do crazy things. (Laughs) I guess now that I am doing those crazy things, as in like Nelson (sp?) is social and likes to go out and grab a drink sometimes and meet his friends for drinks. One of his friends was like really crazy and we go to his place and he makes ","P1-N4008B2":"us drinks and we dance until really late at night and that’s something I’ve always wanted to do. It’s like a safe place and you’re just dancing with people you consider friends and that’s it. It’s kind of like the thrill I’ve always wanted and never had until now. [00:34:13]
THERAPIST: How do you mean you’re capable of anything?
CLIENT: No, I mean. I don’t know. What if I do something really stupid? I don’t even know what that means. It’s just [inaudible at 00:35:41].
THERAPIST: I imagine it’s associated with your dad’s exploits.
CLIENT: No, I hope it isn’t. I don’t want to go there.
THERAPIST: But the idea that it’s crazy, I mean, it can be. But that it can’t be other things too.
CLIENT: No. I don’t know. I was with Chris for so long. And I loved him and he loved me but it never really translated to, “Okay. Let’s have sex.” You know? And then I had my whatever, sexual awakening [ph] and I had been with Graham (sp?) and then [inaudible] and been with like ","P1-N400A11":"Oliver (sp?) and having sex. Feeling the need for it for the first time. And I tried to bring that feeling back to Chris and we did but it was mechanical, I guess? I haven’t really been able to… “Okay. Safe, warm, comforting, loving sex.” It just doesn’t follow. It’s ","P1-N400A12":"like dangerous, dark, and unknown. You know, scary sex? [00:42:02]
THERAPIST: Well, that’s what I was suggesting. That there’s an association of sex and your dad.
CLIENT: I don’t know. I hope not.
THERAPIST: Why not?
CLIENT: What do you mean, “Why not?”
THERAPIST: Why hope not?
CLIENT: Oh, because then I would just totally run away from it because what I associate with him and his exploits is that he hurt my mom. He’s an asshole to her.
THERAPIST: I don’t think that’s all the association but I think that’s some of it. You’re worried that your sexual needs will lead you astray and lead you away from what you really should have. And that’s good. And you sort of see kind of a dichotomy at times between your ","P1-N400AF1":"sexual needs and being in a loving or stable or constructive relationship. I do think there are those associations for you. [00:42:56]
CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) I don’t know what to do about them. (Pause) Well, I mean I do have a fear that I’m like him. That’s why I don’t want to be like him. You know, obviously being with Chris makes me feel like, I don’t know like, it’s all safe and comforting and ","P1-N400B11":"I just feel locked in that and I wonder if that’s what my dad felt when he did it. (Pause) Yeah. I don’t know why I feel if I was locked in so much with Chris. [00:44:49]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:46:23) need to stop for today. I will see you on Monday.
CLIENT: Okay. Thank you.
THERAPIST: I did get your e-mail about 2 weeks from…
CLIENT: Oh yeah. Spring break.
THERAPIST: Not next week. The following week.
CLIENT: April 15.
THERAPIST: Take care.
