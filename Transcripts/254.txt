TITLE: Client "S" Therapy Session Audio Recording, February 18, 2013: Client talks about her religious identity and her need for approval.
DESCRIPTION: Client talks about her religious identity and her need for approval.
THERAPIST: Feel free to come on in whenever you're ready.
CLIENT: It's so cold. Did you get the October thing?
THERAPIST: No, but they said it's being processed.
CLIENT: Yeah, because I got an e-mail about that. I got another one this mVictorng.
THERAPIST: Great. Thank you very much for the help. I think they're finally processing it now.
CLIENT: Yeah. Oh gosh, it's so cold. I can't feel my face. [00:01:45]
THERAPIST: Feeling excluded when your mom was considering divorcing your father?
CLIENT: Yeah, and just everything. I haven't even had a chance to process the need. I put it in a box and forgotten it and I'm just afraid of processing it. But I was very, very, and, you know, like I was what? I don't know. 19 or 18 or something. So impressionable and like I remember the days clearly ","P1-N400211":"when I was converting. You know, like giving up. Not that I was a very religious Hindu, but, you know, like I believed in that in the sense that, you know, you pray and you, you know, there are these gods and goddesses and, you know, whatever. [00:08:20]
THERAPIST: Well, you put it in a box and you didn't have the time to go through it yet.
CLIENT: I don't know how to go through it. Like other than just saying yeah, okay, it was bad. What do I do about it? You know. I'm glad I escaped. Too bad they're not my friends anymore. You know. The other stuff, like guilt tripping or doing something nice instead of doing the thing that they want, ","P1-N4002B1":"to get me what I want. I don't understand that reaction in me. [00:13:10]
THERAPIST: I was thinking in this case being nice isn't, is not really related to the quality of your work. [00:14:15]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So, there's, it's complicated.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Well, I guess in some, even this is a stretch, but if, you know, Victor thinks you're nice, that might be one of the qualifications for a girlfriend.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Being nice is not a qualification for an author.
CLIENT: Yeah. I know.
THERAPIST: But what you said. Maybe they take pity on me.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know why I think that way, but I do. You know, I guess I'm pitying myself too, so and say when I don't I get very scared and I start getting myself. It's not, it makes me feel very bad later on.
THERAPIST: What scares you? [00:15:50]
CLIENT: Well, when I'm like not, I'm not pitying myself. I'm not humble. You know, I've been flying high or whatever. It just feels like oh, I'm going to fall. It's going to hurt a lot. So, then I make myself fall. And then it's just like, then between flying high and then falling it's just I lose a ","P1-N400451":"sense of reality. Like where exactly the ground is and where I am on it, you know. [00:16:51]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I wouldn't say something doesn't have to mean something. I think lots of things have meaning. I'm more questioning you for what if I lean behind how much to evaluate in very stark categories, good or bad. It's not even evaluating. It's sort of a general sense.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. Well, what would that tell you about me? What would that accomplish?
THERAPIST: I'm not sure I understand what would what? [00:19:00]
CLIENT: Just knowing why something's bad or good for me. Yeah, even without my professor kind of telling me to acknowledge this, I have already acknowledged it and fitting myself for it. But in moments when I feel bold, it is very scary. I suppose something in the middle is what one desires, you know. ","P1-N4004F1":"To feel bold and at the same time, be humble. I don't know how to do that. [00:20:50]
THERAPIST: Because maybe they'll get something they want that they don't feel like they could get otherwise.
CLIENT: Some things you can get by making others pity you, but I don't think you can get everything. I guess I'm realizing that.
THERAPIST: Well, there's that question and then there's the question of can you get some of what you want without needing to use pity at all? [00:23:20]
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it would be nice if I stopped pitying myself and using pity, but I've had, I think I've had it like I've done this quite often. I think my first impression I got by getting him to pity me. I've been caught in this story about my past that may or may not have been true. I might make ","P1-N400591":"an exaggeration. Perhaps, I was trying to get them to pity me. Because I guess I didn't think I was interesting enough or pretty enough or just, you know, loving enough to have, to be in a relationship. [00:24:40]
THERAPIST: When you say cash in, who is one or you or anyone cashing in to?
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Well, you're saying cash in on your, you know, if some difficulty or trauma, trouble would it, who are you cashing in to? Who's going to give you the cash? You're going to give, cashing in means you give them something you can cash. Who's getting the cash?
CLIENT: This is mean of me, but yeah, I don't know what I meant.
THERAPIST: Well, it's, I mean it's an interesting expression. To cash in on. [00:28:32]
CLIENT: Like what I do like to gain people's sympathy. Getting sympathy, friendship, connect on a deeper level. Yes, it's very tied to my being I remember like when I told Jeremy, my freshman boyfriend, you know, some of the things that happened to me and he didn't say those things like and until he ","P1-N400691":"said something and I didn't feel it, you know, I didn't feel the connection, the love and all of that, you know. Like he was just, you know, this really, really funny guy from downstairs and all of us were hanging out with him and, you know, he'd make us all laugh and he found me whatever, interesting ","P1-N400692":"or attractive and then I, we shared stuff one night and I suppose after that we felt a connection. You know he felt, he said some very sweet things, like, you know I wish I could take care of you or, you know, whatever like give you a nice childhood this and that. Until he said those things I didn't ","P1-N400693":"feel close to him and a connection on a deeper level. I guess which is why some of the dates that I went to last year I was going through that and I didn't feel anything because there was no occasion to share my past, you know. And obviously you don't do that on dates and stuff. You present your best ","P1-N400694":"self. You try to. Yeah. [00:30:35]
THERAPIST: What did it feel like once you had that connection with Jeremy?
CLIENT: It felt very nice. I kind of miss him. I guess I felt some kind of redemption, you know. Like, finally, you know? You know, like you suffer or something you've gone through. You know, it's like, it's like the meal that you get to relish after a very hard work out, you know. Like yes, I've earned ","P1-N4006D1":"this. Or you work in a mine and you're all dirty and everything and then you're given your, not just your measly pay check, but, you know, you're maybe given a diamond. I suppose I felt that same thing when, you know, Victor said something similar about. I'm over it now. I thought I'd never forget it. ","P1-N4006D2":"Something I'm sure will come to me, but like an acknowledgement of, you know, my suffering and what not. Why do people need that? Why do you need an acknowledgement for your suffering? [00:32:35]
THERAPIST: Because even if you had to endure something on your own you don't have to be alone anymore and the acknowledgement.
CLIENT: So, you say it's got to do with loneliness?
THERAPIST: Maybe in part. I mean I feel like suffering, by definition, there's a particular kind of isolation involved. It's not an experience usually. Even if people suffer as a group, it's usually a very isolated, it's not a communal. It doesn't, it doesn't generate communal feelings. It can be very ","P1-N400731":"lonely and isolating and, you know, and scary too which I think makes people feel more isolated or maybe they feel scared because they feel isolated. So, I think in the acknowledgement alone, it helps people feel less alone and also recognized, not hidden.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I don't know. How does that sound? [00:33:40]
CLIENT: Yeah. Not hidden. Recognized. Those things I think I want. To be seen and to be recognized.
THERAPIST: But, it's complicated. I mean people share things for all sorts of reasons. People share problems or difficulties in their past to share them and to get to know someone and we get to know them. People share things also to coerce someone in to getting something, right? Motivations are very complicated.
CLIENT: So, you're saying the first thing is alright, but the second, not so much?
THERAPIST: Yeah. Absolutely. That's it.
CLIENT: That doesn't mean, you know, there must be. You know, we all abuse things and use them, so.
THERAPIST: Are you not sure? When you ask that, you're asking what or you're wondering what I'm saying? Do you have, do you come to thoughts? I mean imagine you are imagining what I'm saying. This is good and this is bad has something to do with what you think is good or bad. [00:34:50]
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, like I said, I feel like I don't have a realistic sense of things or right and wrong sometimes. So, yeah.
THERAPIST: But you're coming to those conclusions about right or wrong and wondering, when you wonder whether I think this is good or I think this is bad, you're asking those questions based on some feeling you have yourself. Some judgment you have in yourself about, you know, about what I'm saying.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Are you saying this is good? Well, clearly part of you thinks it's good. Otherwise, you wouldn't have come up with the fact that I might think it's good.
CLIENT: Like maybe in that also I'm looking for recognition. [00:36:00]
THERAPIST: Well, do you feel like the only way to get recognition is to fly too high or too low? Maybe the middle ground doesn't feel very, like you'd be recognized.
CLIENT: What is, what is the middle ground? Just being?
THERAPIST: I don't know what the middle is. I'm using your words. I don't know what it is. Is that what it is? Being?
CLIENT: I feel like it is. Maybe that's my goal. To feel comfortable in my skin enough to just be. You know, let myself be and see the other people also. That's all that they want from me and they don't want like a fantastically sad story and they don't want a super, super, happy person, you know, who ","P1-N400951":"has no faults at all and is lecturing and going all the time. It's too extreme. I would like, you know, I see other people, you know, I'm just, I'm happy to see them. Not everyone, but, you know, most people. What do I want from them? I just, you know, want them to, well, this is a very complicated ","P1-N400952":"question because I want very different things at different times. You know, like generally, just, you know, I hope that they're doing well and well I shouldn't say that. I want a lot from people. I want them to be interesting and engaging and happy and sad. Not all the time. [00:37:50]
THERAPIST: I mean to feel that you can only be recognized by being abject is complicated.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Maybe unfortunate.
CLIENT: Yeah, but why did my professor want to know that, you know?
THERAPIST: Want to know your past?
CLIENT: Yeah, like my background. [00:38:52]
THERAPIST: Maybe he's just interested.
CLIENT: Yeah. Why?
THERAPIST: It seems like you were thinking he had an angle.
CLIENT: No. I'm just wondering like so it is important for people. You know, it's like me trying to say oh, you know, I'm not going to use my past and then here's someone who's a figure of authority and everything must think no, don't get rid of her just yet. But, it was different because, you know, ","P1-N400AB1":"I would reveal this kind of information to a potential friend or, you know, like a potential boyfriend. You know, people in authority, you want them to think well of you. You know, like you don't go and tell this to your boss, you know? You want them to think you're efficient and hardworking and smart ","P1-N400AB2":"and all that. I mean all I wanted to know about him is that he's a great writer, you know, and a great teacher of writing. That's all. I don't want to know that he has had a sad past. Do you think it's possible for me to pity myself less? [00:40:55]
THERAPIST: What do you think?
CLIENT: I don't know. To me, like that's what his question meant. When he said acknowledge, maybe that's what he was saying. You should pity yourself. Maybe not as strongly as pity, but something similar. Because I am conflicted about it. You know, sometimes I don't want to acknowledge it. Sometimes ","P1-N400AF1":"I want to feel free and unburdened and that, you know, I could do anything and I have no responsibilities. Then the other extreme is to feel completely bogged down and, you know, and no vision or like completely debilitated by that thing. [00:42:10]
THERAPIST: We've got a minute or so left. What do you think brought that to mind? [00:43:35]
CLIENT: Well, I was just wondering if I would, how much do I like the emotional or need the emotional pity? I mean when she doesn't do any of that, when she's needy and, you know, shabby, I feel very acutely pitiful, you know. That's a very, very powerful emotion that can, you know, reduce me to tears. ","P1-N400B51":"But, it can also debilitate me and that means she does the opposite. It's not as strong an emotion, but it's more subtle. I guess it adds slowly. Like, you know, several, maybe several days of her acting that way and I'll feel slowly differently about her situation and not so debilitated, you know. ","P1-N400B52":"I'm just wondering what these two different emotions. One very, very acute and strong and I can feel it, you know, so strongly. The other is kind of mild.
THERAPIST: Well, certainly evoking pity from someone is a very strong experience. When pity has been evoked, it's a very intense experience.
CLIENT: I mean there is a place for it, I'm sure, but maybe not on a daily basis. [00:45:05]
THERAPIST: The other experience you described is more subtle and more peaceful.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Less urgent.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.
THERAPIST: We are going to stop for today, okay? I will see you on Wednesday.
CLIENT: Okay. Have a good day.
THERAPIST: Thank you again for calling your insurance company. I appreciate it.
CLIENT: Yeah, no problem.
THERAPIST: That's okay. Take care.
CLIENT: You too.
