TITLE: Client "ML" Therapy Session Audio Recording, December 14, 2012: Clients discuss how life in academia is difficult and has had a negative impact on the female client's depressive disorder. Clients discuss a new plan for their current living situation.
DESCRIPTION: Clients discuss how life in academia is difficult and has had a negative impact on the female client's depressive disorder. Clients discuss a new plan for their current living situation.
THERAPIST: Yeah, no, I'm happy to do so. I mean, this is confusing and scary.
THERAPIST: And, you know, new because you guys haven't lived together for how many years?
THERAPIST: So I want to help you guys, like... a game plan is a little too structured, but just (chuckling) something along those lines.
THERAPIST: What do you think has made them better? [0:02:04]
THERAPIST: And have you felt that Tanya has been doing better? Has that registered with you?
THERAPIST: Terrifying? Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: So what does very bad look like?
THERAPIST: Like what? What do you get angry about?
THERAPIST: Kind of cutting?
THERAPIST: So, when you guys were living together over the summers, was it this bad? Like, is this the first time the two of you are together where it's this bad? Or is this... you've had this experience before?
THERAPIST: And it feels that way to you, that this is worse than it's been in the past when you've lived together? Tanya's symptoms?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Can you see a future with James?
THERAPIST: Because in the past when you've felt better, you feel like that could never be regained? That will just always stay in the past? [0:10:55]
THERAPIST: Do you guys talk about this? Is this something that you talk about, or is it... these kinds of conversations, like Tanya expressing this?
THERAPIST: Well, your future is James's future, too, a big piece of it, not all of it.
THERAPIST: That seemed like an important statement, your saying, I chose this. Is it in some...?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Do you feel like that gets lost in Tanya's guilt?
THERAPIST: When Tanya is this bad, do you talk about the impact, or do you keep... on you, or do you keep it to yourself? [0:14:01]
THERAPIST: With Tanya or with anybody? (Pause)
THERAPIST: What do you do with that? (Pause) [0:15:00]
THERAPIST: Do you feel that that's enough for you?
THERAPIST: Well, I'm interested in what other people think, but people aren't you (chuckling). It's... when you're thinking about what someone else needs, it's easy to project what you yourself need, so that might be a projection of other people... you know, people projecting what they need more than ","P1-N4009D1":"what you need. And so it's important to clarify what is helpful to you.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause) You know, outside of being with Tanya and also feeling... like, taking care of her, are there...? It sounds like not at the beginning of the week, but in general are there other things that you...? Do you feel like sort of the time and space to be able to do other things, ","P1-N400A11":"your work, whatever else is important, walks (chuckling, clearing throat)?
THERAPIST: Do you feel like this is sort of consuming, or do you feel that there's sort of other spaces and times for you to do the things you like or need to do? [0:17:55]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause) When you first met, were you depressed, Tanya?
THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like a long time because you guys have been together a while.
THERAPIST: Was 2010 when you moved to Denver?
THERAPIST: Cancer's so common these days in women, it's striking.
THERAPIST: I'm sure that there's some studies on that, but I can't believe how many people, women in particular, I hear have cancer. [0:20:58]
THERAPIST: Not to normalize...
THERAPIST: Wow.
THERAPIST: Did you not... was it the move... like, just sort of the transition adjustment, or was it Brown itself that you didn't like? [0:21:59]
THERAPIST: Do you guys share in your, sort of, sentiments about your... sort of the educational...? Let me be more specific. [0:24:03] In what little we've talked about it so far, it seems like you both feel a sense of disillusionment.
THERAPIST: And that you share that disillusionment.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
THERAPIST: Like being denied access?
THERAPIST: Good family.
THERAPIST: Extended relatives.
THERAPIST: Point person.
THERAPIST: Well, (clearing throat) you certainly want to feel that what you pursue and what you offer has value, right?
THERAPIST: And feeling that it's devalued or has no value is a terrible feeling.
THERAPIST: What was...? You don't have the question because it was answered?
THERAPIST: What was the answer?
THERAPIST: You guys, especially you, Tanya, brighten up when you talk about this. It's clearly something that you think about and share...
THERAPIST: Are passionate about and had a lot of thought in it, about it.
THERAPIST: But that's not what you said a moment ago. It seemed like... I'm not... I'm sure that's a piece of it, not being good enough, but you also talked about not really wanting what they have to offer and not feeling like it's what you need. [0:33:57]
THERAPIST: Do you feel like you tend to sort of turn disappointment inward?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: Yeah, well, among the other things that's interesting, it sort of maybe goes back to something that you said, James. It's like, you're disappointed in other people. You don't really have much control. They are who they are. You're disappointed in yourself, you can at least keep the fantasy ","P1-N401591":"of control even though (chuckling) we have our limitations, too. [0:35:00] But maybe that sort of speaks to something you were saying, James, before, about your choosing to be here, Tanya isn't making you.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: Where are you in your studies, are you nearing the end or...?
THERAPIST: So you have 0.7 left?
THERAPIST: (Crosstalk) Mean, median, and mode, that's what reflects the actual picture, right? [0:37:05]
THERAPIST: That's true, that's true. Are you sort of on your way with your dissertation?
THERAPIST: Do you feel like, you know, assuming Tanya is... will be doing better, that this works for you, doing your... finishing your degree remotely?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. That's helpful to know in terms of just sort of the structure and context of your relationship going forward, that it's not the plan to make sure Tanya's okay and then go back... [0:39:02]
THERAPIST: That this is what...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: In addition to the sort of very rich sort of academic and intellectual connection, are there other things that sort of are... that you share in terms of things that are meaningful to you?
THERAPIST: It's a nice philosophy.
THERAPIST: Okay. Sounds like maybe your experience in academia as well, some needs met, some not.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: It's a hard lesson learned, especially in, well, both realms of thinking. You take one of them, the academic realm, it's exciting and inspiring and... yeah. And so to see its limitations. And then, as you were saying I think two sessions ago, James, the kind of day-to-day potential grind ","P1-N401BF1":"of being an academic where, you know, the job of learning can sort of fall pretty low down on the ladder, is... can be really disappointing.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So let me actually clarify, so I thought that that had changed [at the later meeting] (ph). Is that not changed?
THERAPIST: No, it seems like spending a lot of time together more or less out of choice is different than your feeling like you need to be on watch.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: Well, I can... you now, and this might sort of be a work in progress for us to think about. [0:43:57] It seems like too sort of optimistic, but it seems like there's at least a brief period where you're sort of out of the worst of it, but to then just... I mean, this goes in cycles. So I ","P1-N401DF1":"imagine you unfortunately will go back into it for at least some time. And so it's really up to you and Chad to decide what's best for you. I mean, I'm way going to rely on your judgment in terms of the different treatment options. My sort of... sort of the part of the elephant I'm looking at is the ","P1-N401DF2":"two of you and making sure that you don't end up in this sort of lopsided dynamic where you end up feeling kind of like this anxious caretaker and that you in a sense serve as the partial program (chuckling) for kind of making sure Tanya's safe. And I think that that's where the recommendation came ","P1-N401DF3":"from, or the suggestion, that that would not be a good dynamic. And I mean fortunately you're... you know, this is not like... you haven't developed this over many years where you're trying to break it. You're at the beginning of it, and it's... you know, of sort of how to manage your profound suffering. ","P1-N401DF4":"[0:45:03] That's a good thing, so you can create a structure rather than having to undo a structure that's really detrimental to both of you. And so that's part of my job. And I'm very sort of clear, my patient is not Tanya.
THERAPIST: My patient is your relationship.
THERAPIST: And I'm very clear... and each of you, too, that your relationship. And so my sort of making Tanya the patient would be just a replication (chuckling) of the difficulties that you could be facing in your marriage. So I'm very sort of aware of that. And I don't think... you know, I don't have ","P1-N401E71":"any immediate... I mean, if you were for the last week spending every moment with Tanya because you were worried about her, I'd be more feeling like it's urgent that we have a plan before you leave. Unless you feel that way. I mean, I want to make sure that I'm being attentive to what you need.
THERAPIST: So it doesn't feel like enough of a plan for you?
THERAPIST: Yeah, because you're saying... I mean, because you don't want the default plan to be like, oh my God, I don't know what to do (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Well, I'm not actually suggesting that you will know what you need.
THERAPIST: What I am suggesting is that I feel like I want to be sort of protective of your work with Chad and figuring that out...
THERAPIST: And not sort of... I guess what I'm saying is, my focus is more what the two of you need.
THERAPIST: And that's not to say that I'm not interested in what you need, too (crosstalk).
THERAPIST: That's an important space. I really... this is so... I (crosstalk).
THERAPIST: I feel... no, no, no, don't apologize. I don't like to leave you guys hanging. I mean, is Wednesday a plan and then if something shifts you call me sooner?
THERAPIST: Because I really take seriously what you're saying, James, and so, you know, I want to think about it. I have a couple... yeah, let me think about it, and... but I take that very seriously. And let's address that loophole (chuckling), you know?
THERAPIST: I mean, that's really important.
THERAPIST: Is that okay?
THERAPIST: And let me just... so the time I have on Wednesday is... what is it? 10:45. Does that work as a regular time, 10:45?
THERAPIST: Perfect. Okay. [0:49:04]
THERAPIST: Absolutely, absolutely. Okay, you take care.
THERAPIST: See you Wednesday.
