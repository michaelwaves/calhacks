DESCRIPTION: Client discusses how a recent weekend trip with her boyfriend dissolved into a week of fighting and poor communication.
THERAPIST: Come on in. (pause)
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:00:10). (chuckling) Hi.
THERAPIST: Hi.
CLIENT: Oh, let's see. It's been a week, right? This last few days have been pretty crappy, I guess. So I went to visit Kevin (sp?) over the weekend. And I was nervous last week when I was here because I wasn't sure how he was going to feel when I was there. And when I got there everything seemed good. ","P1-N400111":"We were getting along and he didn't seem unhappy or things weren't awkward. [00:01:02]
THERAPIST: It's very... yea, it's very clear that this is completely baffling you what he's doing.
CLIENT: Yea, I really... I'm so confused and even when I try to... I talk to my best friend and... but she doesn't know him that well because she lives in Pennsylvania. So she's only met him a few times. And she's like, "I don't like him." But I feel like this isn't him. He's just reacting very terribly ","P1-N400631":"to a very terrible situation. And he, himself, is very confused and really scared. And I said to him on Monday, "Why are you still here in this relationship?" [00:35:00]
THERAPIST: Well, it seems like, aside from feeling... expressing some frustration, I feel like you're talking about this in a somewhat detached way.
CLIENT: Yea. I guess. I just...
THERAPIST: Whether he wants to be with you or not seems like a pretty emotional issue.
CLIENT: It is and it's sort of making... I'm just... I don't know if I'm just feeling detached right now or... because before I was super afraid. I didn't want him to leave and I didn't want to... and I am... I don't want him to leave and I don't want us to break up. And I would like to try and move ","P1-N400711":"on now and just start healing from this whole situation. And I don't want to just move on pretend like nothing happened. [00:39:02] And I've even said that to him. Like, "We're never going to move on and forget about it. It's always going to be there but..."
THERAPIST: (sneezes)
CLIENT: Bless you. "We're going to move on and sort of learn from the experience and become better people as we move forward." And he's just not there and he just... so this whole what is going on right now is just completely... I don't even... I feel like part of me is I don't want to be too attached ","P1-N400751":"because if I'm too attached then... and I'm trying to make plans or I'm trying to be with him or something like that. He's getting angry. Or am I being detached because I'm just afraid I'm going to get hurt and if I put too much effort into this, that I'm going to get hurt again? Because I said to him ","P1-N400752":"when I was talking about moving down there and I was like, "Well, it could work. I could move down there and get a job in June. And if we're still together, work on our relationship." [00:40:10]
THERAPIST: And it's really hard for you to relate to what's going on with him. It seems like he seems right now like a black box. [00:43:06]
CLIENT: Yea. And sometimes when I talk to him I don't know what I'm going to get. I don't know if he's going to be angry or mad or happy or sad or whatever. And he just keeps saying how horrible and terrible this whole situation is and it's like the world is ending. And I don't understand how he feels. ","P1-N400811":"And no, I don't really understand how he feels fully because I'm not the one going to court and facing all these charges. But at the same time, I don't know what he thinks I'm... how I'm feeling. Or if he thinks that I'm just sort of skipping along and pretending like nothing happened and wanting to ","P1-N400812":"move forward without it being there. I just don't want to dwell on it and maybe that's just how we deal with things. But we both deal with them differently. [00:44:03]
THERAPIST: I think that's true. I think that's very true. I think your experience in the confusion that he feels I think he's communicating very well although not in an intentional way of what he's feeling. I think he's feeling deeply confused and it's leaving you feeling deeply confused.
CLIENT: Yes. Over this in this sort of state of I don't know. (chuckling) And it's frustrating.
THERAPIST: I hear you.
CLIENT: So I don't know.
THERAPIST: We're going to need to stop today.
CLIENT: OK.
THERAPIST: I will see you on Monday.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: OK. Take care.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Bye-bye.
CLIENT: It's nice and warm today but...
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: ...I don't think it's going to stay like that. Bye-bye.
THERAPIST: Bye. [00:47:09]
