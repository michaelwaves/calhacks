DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the relationship work that she and her husband are doing by each working on their own issues.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in. I’m just going to grab a little water. [00:01:51]
CLIENT: I was thinking over on the way here, did I—started off, I was thinking that my mom had just given me a call. That’s the thing that I had to keep forgetting to say (ph). Passover is coming up and so the next two Tuesdays are—fall on the holiday itself. [00:03:00]
THERAPIST: Mhm. The first two, last two days, is that it?
CLIENT: Exactly, yeah.
THERAPIST: Do you want me to take a look now at the schedule?
CLIENT: Sure, sure. I’ve been meaning to say that for weeks but I keep forgetting.
THERAPIST: And it’s Monday\/Tuesday or Tuesday\/Wednesday?
CLIENT: It’s Tuesday\/Wednesday and then Monday\/Tuesday.
THERAPIST: So next week is the 14th. Yeah, so it’s Tuesday\/Wednesday of next week.
CLIENT: Right, so the 15th and 16th of next week, and then I think the 21st and the 22nd.
THERAPIST: What about, I could do something on Thursday, the 17th.
CLIENT: I am going to be—we’re actually going to Cleveland for Passover, so we’re flying back on the Thursday.
THERAPIST: Okay, I might be able to do something in the early afternoon on Friday. Would that work for you, or is that—
CLIENT: Yeah, tentatively put in that something on that Friday, and then I’ll just check and make sure that Karl can cover for me (ph), basically. [00:04:12]
THERAPIST: Okay, if we did it on Friday, I could do 1.
CLIENT: Yeah, so let’s put that in, and I’ll just confirm when I go home.
THERAPIST: Okay. Do you want to look at the following week, as well?
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: Alright, so it’s Monday\/Tuesday. I have something Wednesday morning. Wednesday mornings aren’t good for you.
CLIENT: Yeah, I’m going to be teaching then.
THERAPIST: I actually have something on Thursday morning. I need to double check, but I think I can do an 11 o’clock on Thursday. Is that something you could do, on the 24th?
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Okay, I’ll put it in. [00:05:03]
CLIENT: I’ll just confirm that via e-mail.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Yeah, it came about (ph) because my mother called me about coming to visit and somebody who wanted to see a friend of hers, who wanted to come over there. She was just calling to check about whether it’s possible, and times. She noticed I will also be seeing some friends while I’m ","P1-N400411":"there. She wanted to basically confirm with me that these things would work. So while I was taking her call, I had at the back of my mind that this is one of those distinctions between how things operate with me and my mother when we’re going to Cleveland, and with Karl and Kathleen involved (ph) ","P1-N400412":"when we’re going to Virginia [00:06:26]
THERAPIST: Like, is that a baby monitor?
CLIENT: (laughing) No, that’s, uh, yeah. When she started babbling, she was just babbling all the time. And I recorded it. Apparently I am very, very (inaudible at 7:03 due to laughter). But it was (pause), it just was something that struck me as being a difference, and (pause) almost to the point ","P1-N400471":"of making it feel different when I was mentioning it to Karl. That I had gotten the phone call, and not that it was—not that I minded it, it made me (pause)—I was just conscious of the comparison in my own mind, of what I was telling him. [00:07:56]
THERAPIST: Sorry about what? [00:23:26]
CLIENT: Almost sorry that (pause) my mom is doing exactly that action that we’ve been trying to get Kathleen to do. That my mother’s been considerate enough to say Christina wants to come over and see us, and she’d like to see you, too, but I know that you have friends coming who are ","P1-N4005D1":"coming over, and I don’t want to step on your plans. So can we coordinate that? And is it okay with you if they come? [00:24:15]
THERAPIST: But why are you sorry for that?
CLIENT: It’s funny, there’s a kind of consciousness that—(pause) this is the—Karl and I both consider this the appropriate route. And to me (ph) it almost felt like in mentioning it, I’d be sort of flaunting, almost? But this is what we want to have happen, and this is ","P1-N400611":"what we think is right. And look, my mom does it. Which is, I think that’s one of those things that I know comes from in me. I sometimes have these moments when I have a difficulty, almost, in distinguishing what’s in me and what’s sort of outside. [00:26:12]
THERAPIST: Would you?
CLIENT: I think it’s probably okay (laughing). I think it’s (pause), I’d probably see somebody who has very strong attachments to family and friends. Very strong attachments in general, also to places, and fairly shy. Kind of dorky. But (pause), lots of, sort of, at home interests. ","P1-N400691":"A very domestic person. [00:32:27]
THERAPIST: With Leah?
CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe when they’re not quite the same, I’d be more likely (ph) to be frustrated or something, or concerned about. I can definitely end up being concerned about things with Leah. I mentioned how my mother remarked that from the time we were little, she’d say I was very ","P1-N400771":"protective of her. I’m not quite sure what that meant when we were little. [00:41:56]
THERAPIST: Tammy, I know you’re kind of thinking about something, we’re going to unfortunately need to stop for today. Just e-mail at some point to confirm about next Friday. I hope you have a good trip to Cleveland and (crosstalk at 00:44:40).
CLIENT: Thank you very much.
THERAPIST: Okay, take care.
