TITLE: Client "L" Therapy Session Audio Recording, September 18, 2013: Client discusses why he's stopped seeing his couples therapist. Client discusses the status of his current sex life.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses why he's stopped seeing his couples therapist. Client discusses the status of his current sex life.
CLIENT: I brought you a check.
THERAPIST: Thank you very much.
CLIENT: You're welcome. Thank you. (pause) Good morning.
THERAPIST: Good morning.
CLIENT: So I can't remember. It was last time we meet that you gave me two pieces of advice. I don't remember if it was advice over two sessions but you... the first one was you suggested that I was going to be OK in one of two ways. That was very helpful. And the other was that you suggested that you ","P1-N400151":"thought it would be... what you would wish for me was that I not... that I accept things as not ideal but also good or be able to do that in general. So I've been using both or trying on both. Certainly the first one kind of rang true and the second one also rings true for a lot of reasons in a lot ","P1-N400152":"of specific situations I've gotten similar advice. [00:03:10]
THERAPIST: But there's a difference between being oblivious to her mood and not attaching significance to every day.
CLIENT: Yes, that. So it's... yea. I mean, I'm not going to be able to not pay attention to it but it just isn't really feasible. And I guess you're saying that's not what you were suggesting anyway. But I don't think I've ever really took you to be saying that. Just so much as like not projecting a ","P1-N4001F1":"trend off of it at any given moment. (pause) [00:06:00]
THERAPIST: I'm not encouraging obliterating categories and having everything be in the good category.
CLIENT: (chuckling) I didn't really take you to be... but I think you were pushing pretty hard on the not ideal part. Not ideal does not equal not good. In part, because you sensed resistance. (pause) It's also been helpful in actually getting the work done to send out these applications because they're ","P1-N4002B1":"not going to be ideal either. [00:10:03]
THERAPIST: My pleasure.
CLIENT: That's not to say it's like trivial and that all of my problems are solved by this one insight but is very helpful. I am trying to use it. (pause) [00:11:01]
THERAPIST: How are you feeling that Tanya's (sp?) are volatile or if they're just as volatile as they've always been?
CLIENT: (pause) Her moods are still somewhat fragile in that, shoot, she has good moods now which is good and has good days. But (pause) relatively small setbacks I can't think of an example offhand can have a larger impact on her than they would if she were healthy whatever exactly that word ","P1-N400351":"means than they have at previous times in our life. [0:12:14] (pause)
THERAPIST: Well, I was asking just about your term of volatility.
CLIENT: OK. I meant it in the same way markets are volatile which has nothing to do with the chemical definition which it just goes into the gas phase easily. Has to do with the popular definition where someone says that's volatile and you think of it as...
THERAPIST: Unpredictable is usually the reference. (pause)
CLIENT: Yea, but volatile compounds is a very predictable thing going into the gas phase at this vapor pressure, this temperature. Anyways, sorry. That's not really the point but (pause) her mood is not wholly unpredictable because I guess I've told you sort of several cause and effect type things. [00:15:01]
THERAPIST: You're looking intently.
CLIENT: (pause) I didn't mean to be. (chuckling) [00:16:01] Yea, I guess I was curious as to whether you were going to let us sit in silence for a long time or whether you had another question.
THERAPIST: I don't know it was just up to me whether I let us sit in silence.
CLIENT: It's not. (pause) It's not.
THERAPIST: But... (pause)
CLIENT: But I've sort of said the things that I had prepared to say in some sense. I don't have a follow up to those. Those were the pieces that I thought was important to bring up. It's all I have. And then I'm not really sure what else to say. [00:17:00] So often when I talk for as long as I have, ","P1-N4004F1":"you have other... you're curious about things. (pause) (chuckling)
THERAPIST: Well, I'm curious about a lot of things. But...
CLIENT: (chuckling)
THERAPIST: ...sometimes I like to sort of just see where your mind goes.
CLIENT: (chuckling) OK.
THERAPIST: What? It seems like something is in your thoughts. What are you thinking?
CLIENT: I just... (pause) It feels like it's turned into a game of some sort but I'm not sure what.
THERAPIST: Oh no.
CLIENT: Not in a bad way. Just in a funny way. You're sort of saying, "Yea. Well, I'm curious as to what your thoughts are so I'll just wait for you to share them." I'm saying, "Well, I'm kind of curious as to what you're curious about so I'll just wait."
THERAPIST: I see. [00:18:07]
CLIENT: And so it's a game.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: I'm not meaning to set it up as a sort of antagonistic game or anything. But that looked like how it was evolving. I was amused.
THERAPIST: It's like, who will speak first?
CLIENT: Something like that, yea. (pause) (chuckling) And now it's lost. We can't even sit in silence for a long. So Tanya (sp?) and I also were doing couples counseling but we stopped going to see him.
THERAPIST: Did you not like him or did you not want to be in couples counseling?
CLIENT: There's a little bit of both. (pause) The first session, I think we both felt a little bit like he wasn't hearing us well. [00:19:03] We'd have to explain things multiple times. And then when he would respond, he would explain it about four or five times in almost the same way. His sort of response ","P1-N4006F1":"which is clearly not how I have felt interacting with you and it's not how Tanya (sp?) has felt interacting with Chad (sp?). We're both relatively comfortable in those relationships. Not that every other one has to conform to those specifications but...
THERAPIST: Bad. [00:22:01]
CLIENT: OK. (chuckling) OK. Like we did the wrong thing or that was a bad situation?
THERAPIST: No, I feel bad because I know him less than I... actually I have someone now. I don't know if you want to try someone else. There are a few people I really want to refer you guys to who are just booked.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I know him less. He came on the recommendation of someone I really trust. He can be very good, just not a good match for you. I don't like what I'm hearing. I don't like that. It sounds like maybe this is... you are concerned with something different than mine. Your... it's sounding like ","P1-N4007F1":"there were two concerns.
CLIENT: Right. Yea, that honesty just isn't heard which I feel like is... Tanya (sp?) was trying to say no, that's not really a good description of it. [00:23:07] He was kind of trying to push her towards this particular description and... yea.
THERAPIST: That's why I feel bad because I referred you to someone and it didn't sound like he did right by you.
CLIENT: Well, thank you. I'm not upset with you so just... (pause) But thank you. Yea, I think we would like another recommendation from you but... so that that gets into the other part of your question which was, do you just not want to be in couples counseling? The answer to that is that (pause) I ","P1-N400871":"think couples counseling can and, with the right person, will help us. But ultimately if we are going to be OK, we are going to do that. And then couples counseling is a particular venue to do certain things and to find certain insights and to be together. [00:24:11]
THERAPIST: Although that's how Nazi Germany did it, too.
CLIENT: (chuckling)
THERAPIST: That's probably actually one of the best binding experiences for people, is to have a common enemy.
CLIENT: (chuckling)
THERAPIST: I'm just not encouraging that as a... I understand...
CLIENT: Go find enemies to see you get closer.
THERAPIST: That's right. But it is a temporary fix. It may not because maybe you understand certain things about each other that you share in common and that's... I don't mean to...
CLIENT: Yea, well and also like we have been very close at some time. So it's not like we're trying to create a relationship from nothing. [00:25:03] We're trying to re-find trust that we had. And so that finding in certain circumstances is helpful to that end, I think. But I hear you and I think you're ","P1-N400991":"right. (chuckling)
THERAPIST: I have a colleague in Westchester I really like and I remember this summer he didn't have availability. But I think... I had just spoken to him a couple of weeks ago. I think he might. But I'll check in with him...
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: ...and see what his... I certainly can never guarantee...
CLIENT: Oh sure.
THERAPIST: ...a match but I don't know about Jannis (sp?) as much. I know him very... this colleague, I know very well. I think he's great. So yea, I'll check. I'll definitely give him a call.
CLIENT: And the other thing about Tanya (sp?) and I is that we're... I don't know. [00:28:05] (pause) We might be particular in some fashion. He may very well be quite a good match for a variety of other people, Jannis (sp?). So...
THERAPIST: Do you need sort of make an apology for your choice?
CLIENT: No, I just... (pause) I would feel badly if you were to blackball him based on our experience. And I'm not sure that... because I'm not sure that a single instance is a sufficient thing. But I should trust you to do your job so sorry. (pause) [00:29:05] He certainly wasn't ideal for us but he ","P1-N400AF1":"might be good for other people. (pause)
THERAPIST: Well, yea. I have a couple different thoughts about it. One thought I had is sort of even for us therapists, hearing about someone or working with someone who is suicidal and can't really guarantee their safety can be overwhelming. I'm not justifying him. I'm not saying that. But...
CLIENT: No, no, no, no. You've already been pretty clear about that.
THERAPIST: Yea. But just sort of I think... I'm trying to think about why I chose this to say but I think to sort of help you have perspective because it's been such the fabric of your life. [00:30:04] And so in some ways it's overwhelming and in some ways it's an overwhelming situation that's you've ","P1-N400B51":"kind of accommodated to, to some extent so... yea. (pause)
CLIENT: Yea, I think that's helpful as a plausible explanation of what happened. Thanks. (pause) I guess there's a sense in which I'm aware that my life is very different from other people's lives at the moment. Particularly people that I know and was in grad school with for several years. There was ","P1-N400B71":"a time in our lives were very similar and they're not similar now. So there's always... (pause)
THERAPIST: Sure. But I'm so interested in this dynamic today. There's a particular... it's kind of a sort of a back and forth between us today about who's going to talk and like... yea. It's sort of interesting. I don't know what to make of it. It's interesting. [00:33:05]
CLIENT: (chuckling)
THERAPIST: The thought I had earlier in the session was that we went a week without seeing each other. So actually two weeks we haven't seen each other and I wondered if that was a piece of it, too, to sort of to getting back into the grove after that sort of mini break.
CLIENT: Yea. There's certainly some of that. (pause) That was certainly a problem when I didn't see you for a month was getting back into the groove of it.
THERAPIST: So yea, I did have a couple of thoughts. My other thought is we haven't really talked much about yours and Tanya's (sp?) sex life and how that's been impacted or if it's been impacted or is it present after all of this. I don't know.
CLIENT: (pause) [00:34:00] Yea, I'm thinking. I don't think that's sometimes we've ever talked about. Is that right?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Yea, OK. (pause) [00:35:00] I don't want to get two minutes into talking about that and I have to leave it for a week. Is that...
THERAPIST: I feel like in that silence, I want to sort of make the qualifier that I don't want to do a Jannis (sp?). Make you talk about something you don't want to talk about.
CLIENT: (chuckling) Well, thanks. I appreciate that. It seems like something important and it's not something that I am going to volunteer information about in the sense that like I'm not going to comment and start talking about that just...
THERAPIST: Because it feels too private?
CLIENT: Maybe. (pause) It certainly feels very private. (pause) I also really trust you, though. So it's not like that. (pause) [00:36:01] But I think it's also one of those things I just don't talk about in general. So it's particularly something to talk about. (pause) And it's one of those questions ","P1-N400D31":"I feel like particularly since we've never really talked about it there's a lot of context that seems relevant. I'm not really sure where in the context to... so I'm just going to jump in, I guess. [00:37:06]
THERAPIST: But masturbation is still not... it's still a qualitative and different experience than having sex. And it's sort of in that sense in people's sexual lives are distinct and they're also kind of woven into the narrative of their relationship. And this idea of negotiation of needs, having a ","P1-N400DF1":"mismatch of needs, in the extent to which you have to give up some of your needs or at least displace them or I don't know, however you say it is certainly part of that larger issue perhaps.
CLIENT: Yes, yes. (pause) And obviously that's a particularly private need and so that gets harder to talk about or balance. It's not like the first one that comes up when we talk about needing to balance things. [00:44:01]
THERAPIST: Pretty important.
CLIENT: Yea. (pause) Yea. (pause)
THERAPIST: And so I was thinking about why it came to my mind specifically today and I'm not exactly sure. I think mostly it's just a lot of what... I hope not everything but a lot of what we focused on is your relationship with Tanya (sp?). And I realize as a part of your relationship, I knew really ","P1-N400E71":"very little is inaccurate. I knew nothing about... it's also a part of you. It's not just about your marriage. It's a part of who you are as a person. But I think that's why it came to mind to maybe just as you talked about the couples counseling in particular. I mean, you think about that since something ","P1-N400E72":"that most couples talk about in counseling.
CLIENT: Makes sense. [00:45:00]
THERAPIST: One thing I do realize we're going to need to stop for today. So you can... we can talk about this or other things again.
CLIENT: (chuckling) OK.
THERAPIST: It's not my place to talk and tell you what you should talk about.
CLIENT: No. But you sort of help steer the conversation because I can't always pick out what's important to talk about. It is a conversation.
THERAPIST: So I will see you next week then. Take care.
CLIENT: Thanks a lot.
THERAPIST: Sure.
