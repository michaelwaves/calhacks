DESCRIPTION: Client discusses a traumatic event from her past and how it has affected her romantic relationships. Client discusses her frustration at her current education system.
THERAPIST: Hi, Marlene, come on in. I'm just going to adjust the...
CLIENT: I have never noticed this before.
THERAPIST: You haven't noticed...?
CLIENT: Oh, the flowers before.
THERAPIST: Oh, the flowers, really?
CLIENT: Yeah. Were they there the whole time?
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: Nice, (inaudible at 00:00:41). So, yeah, I didn't come last week because my nephew was born. That was exciting. That was supposed to be the day before, but she was in labor for a long time. I'm excited about that. [00:01:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I actually contacted her, because she's a health care provider. It's just for a federal program, it sounds like you need to get...
CLIENT: Authorization.
THERAPIST: ...authorization, yeah.
CLIENT: All right.
THERAPIST: That shouldn't be a problem.
CLIENT: It shouldn't be a problem; my primary care wants me to do that...
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:01:26)
CLIENT: ...anyways, so, I just have to call the insurance today, because I think I'm meeting with her on Thursday, which is good.
THERAPIST: Which one was that?
CLIENT: The Celexa.
THERAPIST: That's interesting, make you want to hurt yourself, (crosstalk at 00:02:08) thoughts-
CLIENT: Not hurt, but more when I was stressed out, I was more depressed.
THERAPIST: Yeah, you should definitely share that with her.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: She might have thoughts as to why.
CLIENT: I know that. When I was going to my previous primary care, she said she wanted me to get off that, and I think I didn't know. She was like, "Maybe we should get off that [or not] (ph)," that could be part of the reason.
THERAPIST: What kind of memories?
CLIENT: Some (ph) stupid. I got upset about-he had a CD. [00:04:00] He never buys CDs. It was more-I probably like-CD that a girl would buy or something, or a guy would listen to with a girl. I just remember in past relationships, I'd always relate to people with music. I was like, "Why does he have ","P1-N400491":"that CD?" (inaudible at 00:04:26), "Who is he listening to that CD with?" That was another thing, with me and him, we related music-wise.
THERAPIST: Closure on...?
CLIENT: Just past history and past relationships. I bury them and it seems like it comes up in my everyday life. Just memories or like a flashback.
THERAPIST: Are the flashbacks specific images?
CLIENT: Yeah. I think, I remember things that have happened in the past so vivid. [00:06:06] Whatever (inaudible at 00:06:08).
THERAPIST: I don't know. Are you questioning that?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What's the question?
CLIENT: I don't want him to feel bad, either (ph). I don't want that to affect our relationship, either. Does that make sense?
THERAPIST: Well, affect it how?
CLIENT: I don't know. Number one, that I never told him, and for two, for him to be angry or angry at that person, because I don't want retaliation.
THERAPIST: Are you worried that that's something that Steve would do?
CLIENT: No, but I just know how people...if someone told you that and so many people have, you...I don't know. [00:11:08] It's an instinct, to want to protect the person you love, and I don't want him to feel guilty about that. I'm thinking about his feelings instead of mine.
THERAPIST: Why, do you think?
CLIENT: I just feel like it's easier. It's easier for me to hurt than to see people around me hurt.
THERAPIST: Because you guilty?
CLIENT: I don't feel guilty. I just don't like to see the people I love hurting. I'd rather it be me. [00:12:00]
THERAPIST: Do you feel like he is hurt, now that you've told him?
CLIENT: I think he felt bad for me. I don't want anybody to feel bad for me.
THERAPIST: How is it unfair? How would it be unfair?
CLIENT: It's like I acted like it never happened, and now I'm mentioning it now. He heard something about it. [00:13:00] He asked me about it before, and I told him, "No, that never happened," so I would feel bad about bringing it up now.
THERAPIST: Can you tell me about the better feeling?
CLIENT: I just feel like he'll better understand me and I feel like there's a weight lifted up off my chest. That feels better. It feels better to talk about things that bother you all the time. I don't think I ever felt (inaudible at 00:14:02).
CLIENT: I still think I don't-I don't want to [do it] (ph). I just felt like bringing it up. It makes it real.
CLIENT: Right now, I still don't want to talk [about it] (ph). It make me upset. I don't want to be upset.
CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know how I feel [about it] (ph).
THERAPIST: Overcome a part of it.
CLIENT: Where it doesn't affect your relationship.
THERAPIST: That may not be possible, but your awareness of it makes a big difference. It affects your relationship because it affects you and impacts you.
CLIENT: It definitely affects our sexual relationship, because [since we have been fighting] (ph), we definitely don't want to be intimate with other, but now that we've gone therapy, I've gone to therapy, things have gotten better. [00:17:05] But some things, I get sensitive about.
THERAPIST: Like?
CLIENT: I don't know. If I feel like I haven't pleased him or he doesn't feel like...somehow, I always feel like he's just not attracted to me, for some reason. That's on me.
THERAPIST: Were some of the flashbacks you were having about the rape?
CLIENT: I always do. I've had other occasions with other people, too, where they've tried to force themselves on me.
THERAPIST: What do you feel like you've done wrong?
CLIENT: Putting myself in the position to trust somebody. I feel like in the first situation, not doing anything about it, I felt guilty because he did it to other people. A couple times, even after that, Steve still had a friendship with him, had no clue. He was telling me about he would do weird stuff. ","P1-N400C31":"[00:20:01] He was suicidal or what-not and I didn't want to hang out with him anymore. I don't feel bad for him.
THERAPIST: No (ph)?
CLIENT: And that makes me feel like...I don't know how I feel about that. I just (inaudible at 00:20:23) it.
CLIENT: I guess it's given me closure (inaudible at 00:21:08), I understand that there are (inaudible at 00:21:12), that's why I get upset. It's not just...
CLIENT: I don't feel that way anymore. I feel like there are reasons. And I think I can get past them. [00:22:00]
CLIENT: But I had to be (inaudible at 00:22:13) while coming here. It's like part of me-I don't want to talk about this stuff. I don't know if it's helping me or...
THERAPIST: I understand that.
CLIENT: Does this actually help people (ph)? [00:23:01]
THERAPIST: Well, it's interesting that you said that, because just a minute ago, you said it is.
CLIENT: Well, that's the questions I have. I feel like, yes, it's helping me, but I feel like it's so hard. It's like there's so much going on work and school and just providing and trying to get (inaudible at 00:23:32). The time I spend here is my only free time, which is-I need it, but it stinks.
THERAPIST: "But it stinks," you said?
CLIENT: It stinks. It's your only free time, but I need to do this, and I think that's the debate. It's hard to come here when you know you have so much other stuff that you should be doing. [00:24:03] And I feel like I'm being selfish, in a way.
THERAPIST: For coming here?
CLIENT: Yeah. How I was raised, you just go to church and you pray. And that spending money on stuff, this, is...I don't know, not a necessity. But that's how I've been raised.
CLIENT: That's where I'm at. I want to be able to express myself and not cry, I really do.
THERAPIST: [sneezes] Excuse me!
CLIENT: Bless you.
CLIENT: Whenever I get to the point where I feel safe, even though I shouldn't feel safe, and we can just be where we were a couple years ago. [00:30:09] Just living and enjoying each other's company.
THERAPIST: [I can] (ph) feel your ambivalence. I think you have a lot of logistical things that keep you from coming here sometimes, but I also think there's ambivalence, as well.
CLIENT: Yeah. I think because I just-I don't want him getting upset. I think it's, should it be my day off with him? I'd enjoy my day off. [00:31:00] I guess there's a lot behind it.
THERAPIST: Well, that's how you feel not only about therapy but your free time, you feel like you should feel free and free from emotional turmoil and problems and it's frustrating to you that your free time doesn't really feel free.
CLIENT: It's not always (ph) something like this, so I know it's worth it. But I started school, so I don't have any free time (inaudible at 00:31:42), which, school's fine. It's school. I'm taking one class and (inaudible at 00:31:52) I was (inaudible at 00:31:53) went to school when I was younger. ","P1-N401151":"I just never spoke up. [00:32:00] We always thought the professor is right and you don't have an opinion.
THERAPIST: It's nice to be able an adult learner.
CLIENT: It is.
THERAPIST: Very different than being a kid learner.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You have much more control.
CLIENT: Yeah, sometimes (ph) yeah. [00:33:00] I feel like I could have done a lot better if I spoke up for myself. I was (inaudible at 00:33:09) a lot of professors that would just teach and not explain and just expect you to know it, and that's not teaching.
THERAPIST: Well, that's been your experience in so many parts of your life, where people are not acting in a trustworthy manner. They have an unfair advantage but really unfair, it's unfairly gotten.
CLIENT: I know the program that I went to was unfair in a lot of ways. I had someone bring their-I knew somebody that brought the school to court because of it. They had (ph) a lawsuit against them, because one of their clinical teachers failed him because he was a male. She said, "I don't believe in ","P1-N4012F1":"male nurses and I'm not going to pass you." [00:36:01] She didn't pass him.
THERAPIST: You're back in the same program?
CLIENT: I'm back at the same school. A lot of different teachers. It looks like a lot of younger professors, which is nice, so I hear different learning styles. They're doing a lot of things different. [00:39:00] I don't know, they're more up-to-date than they were before. It seems like there are a ","P1-N4013F1":"lot more resources, so that's good.
THERAPIST: What would happen that you would fail out again? What do you think would prevent you from succeeding?
CLIENT: It's the exams. I'm awesome in clinical. They have all multiple-choice and it depends on how they grade it, (inaudible at 00:40:37). I think the girls that studied together did a lot better, because when they went to lecture, they didn't take anything from the lecture, because it was never on ","P1-N401471":"the exams. It was a waste of time. [00:41:00] They taught each other.
THERAPIST: How many years did you work with her?
CLIENT: Four or five. I still stay in contact with her son and everything. She looked like she needed some emotional support, like a friend, and that's what happened. We ended up being friends, because her family wasn't the best family.
THERAPIST: That they're maybe neglected?
CLIENT: Right. Very neglected. They take your work so personal; it's so personal with them. [00:43:02] It's hard not to get attached. They need so much that they're not given, so for me, if I see somebody in that situation, I want to give them all [of me] (ph). I can't do this anymore.
THERAPIST: Marlene, we're going to need to stop for today, okay?
CLIENT: All right.
THERAPIST: I will see you next week.
CLIENT: Have a nice day.
THERAPIST: Thank you very much, you too.
CLIENT: Thank you.
