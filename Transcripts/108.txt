DESCRIPTION: Client just got engaged and is anxious about setting the invite list. Client only wants people he likes at his wedding and feels this will alienate his parents and other family members.
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in.
CLIENT: Hi. Sorry.
THERAPIST: That's okay.
CLIENT: I don't think 3:30's are going to work for me. If we could do 3:45.
THERAPIST: Let me take a look.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I'm not sure about how my schedule is.
CLIENT: Okay, that's fine.
THERAPIST: I'll take a look.
CLIENT: Sorry about that. I just, we had an issue at school today and I actually had to leave a meeting. So, well, yeah, I'm here. Everything's good. I had a really good weekend. This weekend I got engaged.
THERAPIST: Oh, congratulations.
CLIENT: Thank you. Thank you. I think it was a big step in my life because everything to do with the ring I did by myself. As far as the money goes. As far as picking it out. I mean I had my girlfriend, well, my fianc�'s, input on what she wanted, but I did everything by myself. It goes back ","P1-N400211":"to like when I told my parents that I purchased a ring and they got really upset because they wanted to be a part of it. They wanted to do everything and I told them no. It kind of pissed me off a little bit that they got upset. [00:01:30]
THERAPIST: What's coming? [00:10:30]
CLIENT: I know all these questions are coming. All the well, why. My fianc� and I have talked about this. When we do sit down for the guest list, there are going to be some extreme battles that we're going to have to fight. I know she's, her and her mother's boyfriend do not get along at all. ","P1-N400371":"They don't even speak. She has mentioned that she doesn't want to invite him to the wedding. Well, I have the same issue with my dad and his sister. I don't want her at the wedding. We've talked about compromises where I'll tell my father I will only invite her because of you, but my choice is not to ","P1-N400372":"have her or any of her family and I'm not just going to seclude my cousin from being invited to my wedding. I'm going to exclude him, his brother and his sister. So, it's not like I'm just picking on him. [00:11:30]
THERAPIST: Yeah. That was one thing I was thinking. In getting to know you, you spend a lot of your mental space preparing for battle. So, one thing I wonder is the best use of your mental space?
CLIENT: Is it? No. But, I feel that growing up I've always prepared and been battled. Whether it's been battling my weight. Battling. You know, I feel like I've always been in a competition and this is just me. My family, I felt we were always competing against my dad's sister's family and everybody ","P1-N4003D1":"else. Everything else that goes on in my life now is a competition about who has this. Who has that? This one has that. Can I get this? [00:13:45]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean one of the problems is and you know, in sort of tracing it back, which I completely understand that, back to your childhood and sort of bringing this with you in to your adult life is have they then won? If you are able, if you're internalizing that and continuing to do that, ","P1-N400411":"that itself is a losing battle.
CLIENT: No. Exactly. Exactly. That is what I am trying to work on. I'm trying to establish not being as hostile and not being as ready to fight. I guess that's probably just the environment that I was in. I mean I was always constantly in fights at school because of my weight. I was constantly getting ","P1-N400431":"in to trouble because I wanted to be the class clown and the funny guy and do all this other stuff. [00:15:00]
THERAPIST: You get yourself so worked up.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: You get, you spend, I can see the wheels spinning when you start in here. You get yourself so worked up and sometimes I comment or you sort of think of something and then something shifts and we actually talk about stuff and I can see you kind of coming down, but I've also seen the reverse ","P1-N4004B1":"where you get yourself really amped up.
CLIENT: Yes. Yes. And, that's, that's a trait that I said before that I see not only in myself. I see it in my mom and I see it in my older brother and I feel like I really have the trait because my mom and her sisters, they get the same way. I feel like it's a temper problem that I've inherited through ","P1-N4004D1":"genes and it's not what I want. It's not who I want to be because like we just talked about, I do stress over battling. I do stress over confrontations. [00:16:30]
THERAPIST: Well, here's one thought I had. It's not a direct answer to the question you just posed, but see from my vantage point there's a lot of people who have given you a hard time in your life for sure.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: That's not debatable. I also wonder sometimes whether you see people posing you when, at the very least, maybe they're being neutral or you're missing opportunities when people are actually trying to facilitate and help.
CLIENT: But, from my perspective I don't see that. From my perspective I just see people being who they are. I just see who they become. I guess it's probably my fault because it's like that trust issue where if you screw me, it's very hard for me to accept them back in to that little area that I have ","P1-N400591":"of trust. For me, that's extremely difficult because once you do get out of that trust, I tend to not give you the time or the day. That's probably affecting most of my relationships because as we have talked in here most of the time I hate in my relationships is tending towards my family. It's tending ","P1-N400592":"towards things that have been done to me as opposed to what I have done to them. Honestly, I, I've done a lot of bad things. [00:20:30]
THERAPIST: And how are they different?
CLIENT: Don't acknowledge me. They don't acknowledge me. I mean my aunt does, but my cousins and my uncle could care less. [00:24:00]
THERAPIST: And you feel they're different when the company is open?
CLIENT: They're different when the company's open. When the company is closed and they don't any stress or anything going on, they're the nicest most wonderful people alive. I want to be around them. I don't want to be around them when the company is open.
THERAPIST: Do you think it's that they're districted?
CLIENT: A lot. Yes. A lot. Yes. Early on, when they were going through the hardships of just being established and getting a lot of grief from their employees and taking it out on me and my brothers and my sisters I put in my head it's okay, it's because of their stress. There's a lot going on and they're ","P1-N4006B1":"just blowing off steam. Fine. Good. Great. I thought that was only the first couple of years, but as it continued progressively to get worse every year, that's when finally this year I finally saw that the light at the end of the tunnel that was like you can't be here anymore because mentally I just ","P1-N4006B2":"could not take it. Mentally I was breaking down. Part of my issue was going to the company where they surrounded me with bad people. [00:25:30]
THERAPIST: Was it a way to get, to feel like you had some control over the situation that seemed uncontrollable?
CLIENT: Yes. It was a way to get in to my own little world and get out of the real world and listen to the nonsense. It was a way where I could just zone out from it.
THERAPIST: This may seem like not at the moment.
CLIENT: What's that?
THERAPIST: Why don't we try a month where you come every week and see how things go? I really want to jumpstart things for you.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I don't know if working helps you financially. I'm happy to think about doing something, adjusting for you. You said this week after week or bi-weekly after bi-weekly that you've got this anger inside that you need help with and you need to let it go in participating
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: You have other, more creative endeavors to pursue than that. And, I'm not saying that you don't pursue those endeavors, but yeah, I want to help you with that. [00:27:00]
CLIENT: Okay. Yeah. We can work that out. I mean we can start next week if you want.
THERAPIST: What do you think about it? What do think or suggest?
CLIENT: I think it's fine. I think it's fine. Now that I can do it, Tuesdays work for me. I mean I can do Tuesday's at 3:45 if that's possible.
THERAPIST: I'm pretty sure. I'll need to double check, but I'm pretty sure that 3:45 would work.
CLIENT: Because I'm in agreement with you. If I have to come every week, I'm more than willing to do it now that I have an income coming in. It's not a lot, it's under thirty grand, but it's still an income.
THERAPIST: Well, you can let me know if you need more of a reduction to afford it every week.
CLIENT: I mean I can do the hundred every two weeks. The two hundred every two weeks or I don't know what you want to, what you want to do for payment or whatever.
THERAPIST: Well, it's up to you. I mean if you could do a hundred a week, that's great. I know at some point I think you were paying me a little bit less when you were unemployed.
CLIENT: I can do, a hundred a week is fine. I can do the hundred a week. [00:28:00]
THERAPIST: You can do that?
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Okay. And, you, I'll count on you to tell me if something changes.
CLIENT: Yes. Absolutely, because I do appreciate you being flexible with that. If it's alright I'll just pay every two weeks.
THERAPIST: Sure, that's fine.
CLIENT: Just because there's other stuff.
THERAPIST: Yeah, that's not a problem.
CLIENT: Okay. Yeah. You know, moving forward I do, I do want to be able to control the anger and like you just mentioned I don't feel like I can do it every other week. I think there's just a lot of stuff going on where I need to be more on top of it. More controlling the getting ready for battle. Like ","P1-N400A11":"I mentioned before, I feel a lot of my battle started when I was younger. Pretty much everything I've done has been a battle. I mean constantly, right now, I'm battling my weight. I'm battling my addictions. I'm battling juggling my life as opposed to where I want it to where other people think I should ","P1-N400A12":"be. I'm battling who I am as a person. I want to be this guy, but I'm here now. How do I get to be that guy? I'm battling my family. I hate this person because of this. [00:29:30]
THERAPIST: Well, it's very tough when inactive independence is seen as hostile.
CLIENT: Yes. Extremely. When I moved back in with my girlfriend I knew I was never going back home. I knew there was no way that I could live there because when I left I thought it's what I wanted and after being a part of it and seeing everything it really turned me off. It really pointed me in the ","P1-N400A91":"other direction to go back home to where I am now because that's what I want. That's where I want to be. That's the home environment that I like. That's the home environment that I've always been looking for and never got. Everything is not constantly yelling or screaming or battling. [00:31:30]
THERAPIST: Well, it's hard to tune people out when they're already in.
CLIENT: Exactly. They're already in. They're in there. I have my probably has layers in there on the closest layer that it is. Even if they do get plucked out of one area, they're still very, very close. Or whatever I do they come back in and that's very difficult for me because how do I tell my mother ","P1-N400AF1":"and my father? I felt like I took the right step in doing something on my own and making a decision on my own that I could be praised or whatever and then after they go on their rant then they talk about how beautiful it is and how happy they are. [00:33:10]
THERAPIST: So, they were able to come around eventually?
CLIENT: After a while, but that's how I was before treatment. I would get enraged, go off and then retrace my steps after. Now I see it. They go off. They get mad and then after they have time to digest it, then they process what's going on and how nice of a situation it is. It's just I see where I ","P1-N400B31":"get it from. Where I got it from and am still getting it from. It's just that repetition that's constantly been in my life that's just frustrated the hell out of me. It still frustrates me because every time I feel like I'm going two steps forward, there's always that extra third step that I'm taking ","P1-N400B32":"back I feel like when I'm over there. [00:34:10]
THERAPIST: That's an interesting analogy.
CLIENT: You know. I'm slowly becoming able to walk because I am moving forward. It's something that I'm not used to yet.
THERAPIST: Well, Chris, we are going to need to stop.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So, I will, let's say 3:45 and if for some reason I don't have that correct and I can't do, I will e-mail you.
CLIENT: Perfect.
THERAPIST: Congratulations.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Thank you very much. I'll see you next week.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Take care.
