TITLE: Client "D" Therapy Session Audio Recording, May 05, 2014: Client talks about her feelings of irritation and uncertainly about her self-control when she is dealing with her mother-in-law.
DESCRIPTION: Client talks about her feelings of irritation and uncertainly about her self-control when she is dealing with her mother-in-law.
THERAPIST: Hi! Come on in! I just got your mess , I had to get your message.
CLIENT: So sorry. I didn’t, you know, I checked the time before I left the house and it’s just, catching up on a backlog of e-mails and... (chuckles) It just sort of escaped me. Sorry about that.
THERAPIST: It’s interesting.
CLIENT: Anyway... I’m not going to pretend that it was a completely pleasant visit with Kathleen and Paul. (chuckles) I was really glad that Paul came... but... For me, where I’ve (inaudible) it was very much the same, that kind of, I, I didn’t... always like what was going on, or ","P1-N400231":"I didn’t always feel comfortable. There were the awkwardnesses, of course. But I was... the thing was, I was well able to sort of... stand on the outside of it, in a way. Watch, realize that... it was almost like, “Hey look, Tammy! You’re having the most perfectly normal conversation ","P1-N400232":"right now! If Kathleen’s not engaging with that, that’s okay; that’s Kathleen, but you’re having a perfectly... normal conversation (inaudible). “
THERAPIST: That’s really good. It’s a big deal.
CLIENT: (pause) I was going to say that there weren’t things that still, you know... There, that bag of gifts in a way, it looked kind of, it did get to me, because it sort of... (pause) There, I think it’s getting back to that, what I was talking about, when it came to my birthday present. ","P1-N400391":"I mean, these are more appropriate presents. They, Paul had chosen them and they were, you know, sensible things. But... (pause) there was still that feeling of excess that had kind of, that has kind of tended to overpower me before now. (sighs) I’m still not really sure what to... what to make ","P1-N400392":"of that, what exactly about it makes me... feel uncomfortable.
THERAPIST: She’s so competitive! (client affirms) She’s so competitive. She sort of felt undermined by Genevieve, for choosing, for not choosing her.
CLIENT: Yeah. You know, it wasn’t even like, one second after that, after she just sort of checked with Mommy, “Everybody here is all right, it’s all safe.” Can you imagine? Just love me right away, and went after something else. She has a nine-month-old baby’s attention ","P1-N400411":"span, but it’s just that kind of, that was very constant.
THERAPIST: There is a real aggression to how Kathleen approaches people. It’s hard, it’s scary enough as an adult to deal with it, but as a baby, it’s absolutely overwhelming.
CLIENT: Yeah. She kept her distance, because... I mean, she’s... I watch Genevieve every day. She’s not stupid. (pause) I mean, this is a baby who knows exactly how close to go to the cat. As much as she’s fascinated by Fluffy (sp), adores Fluffy, she never ever pushes it, which has ","P1-N400491":"been absolutely mind-blowing to me, that she’s that little and she already knows that you can reach out to the cat, but don’t grab? [00:41:06]
THERAPIST: You know what it means, because you know your baby. You know when you give the warning whimper, too. (client affirms) (pause) You can identify with what Genevieve was doing at that moment vis-a-vis Kathleen.
CLIENT: Exactly. Exactly right. (pause) There was a funny thing. There was another time when... Kathleen said they’d been having mice, so she asked me about advice in getting a cat to deal with the mouse problem, was there a type of cat I could recommend. And... I don’t for a minute believe ","P1-N400511":"that they would get a cat. Her brother is allergic to cats and they like to have them stay there. [00:45:01]
THERAPIST: That is interesting! Tammy, we’re going need to, nothing to apologize for, we’re going to need to stop. Thank you for your flexibility, and I will see you next Tuesday, then. (client affirms) Okay? Okay, take care!
