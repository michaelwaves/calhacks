TITLE: Client "S" Therapy Session Audio Recording, September 20, 2013: Client discusses her past and current feelings about hierarchy and how one's economic status impacts her feeling about that person.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her past and current feelings about hierarchy and how one's economic status impacts her feeling about that person.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in. [00:02:00]
CLIENT: What a nice dress!
THERAPIST: Oh, thank you very much.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:02:23) [laughs] Oh. It's hot, then it's cold, and... [laughs] Doesn't make sense.
CLIENT: I guess we can continue from last time, or should I say what I'm thinking or whatever? [laughs] [00:04:00]
THERAPIST: I guess you need a horse, then.
CLIENT: Like a high and a low...
THERAPIST: Right. A question is why does a horse need to be in the picture?
CLIENT: [laughs] So I can gallop away. [laughs] I don't know. [laughs] [00:06:00] I don't know, some sort of elevation or-what's the opposite of elevation? [laughs] Descent?
THERAPIST: Is there a hierarchy in here?
CLIENT: Yeah, isn't there?
THERAPIST: It's your hierarchy. You tell me.
CLIENT: You want to know my hierarchy (inaudible at 00:06:39)?
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: Well, you have a very nice place in Providence. [laughs] A nice office. At some point, I also consider that (inaudible at 00:06:52) for five minutes, becoming a psychiatrist, helping people with their problems. [00:07:00]
THERAPIST: It sounds like you like it. It looks nice.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Where does play into the hierarchy?
CLIENT: Well, I think you're doing much better than I am. [laughs] In probably most ways. That makes you higher than me. I don't have to do this now or I don't do it because the occasion doesn't present itself. We're not in a social context, where I have to be like, "Oh, yeah, you probably have it all." ","P1-N400411":"I don't have to go there (inaudible at 00:07:41).
THERAPIST: Why? Why don't you go there here but you go in other places?
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. Maybe because I'm not getting-I'm not here to get-(inaudible at 00:08:00). I don't know. [laughs] Something to think about. Why do I do that?
THERAPIST: It is interesting.
CLIENT: [sighs] So I can hurt you, I guess?
THERAPIST: How?
CLIENT: If I would go there-
THERAPIST: You would be hurting me.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Push you away. When I think about-and I've thought about that with everyone, my mom, Chris, everyone, every colleague I've had, every teacher I've had, every new friend I've made, every...yeah. There are some guys that I went out on first dates that I didn't do that. [laughs] [00:09:00]
THERAPIST: Kind of like a moral superior position?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like they have some-a material superior position so that you could have a moral superior position?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But you don't need that here.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't. I don't need to hurt you. I would be this way with my first boyfriend. I don't know, I was even more immature back then [laughs] but somehow less volatile and more stable. [00:10:03] Late teens, early 20s (inaudible at 00:10:08).
THERAPIST: Do you feel those feelings towards me and suppress them so that you don't hurt me, or is it just not something that you think about a lot?
CLIENT: Do I suppress them so that I don't hurt you?
THERAPIST: Well, you were saying that you don't have the feelings in here about, "Look at all you have and I have nothing."
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You're saying because you don't want to hurt me.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So I'm wondering sort of if you feel like you're trying hard not to hurt me.
CLIENT: No. I phrased it maybe a little weirdly. What I meant was that I maybe think that way with the people I do that with, to hurt them. [00:13:00] When you pose that question, "Why don't you do it here?" I guess I should have said, "I don't feel the need to hurt you," but in every other scenario ","P1-N4007F1":"I apparently do. [laughs] It's weird.
THERAPIST: That you feel angry in those other scenarios.
CLIENT: Yeah. Why? Why is it any concern of me? Why is that someone has whatever that is that they have? [laughs] Just because they've had nice parents (ph) doesn't mean that-it's not even like an economic imbalance where they exploited me to have nice parents (ph). There's no equation there, but still, ","P1-N400831":"it's weird. [00:14:00]
THERAPIST: Maybe.
CLIENT: They do? Even if they're in their 30s?
THERAPIST: No, I was saying maybe that's true, what you're saying.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You were saying, "Maybe I distance them so they don't even feel like it," and I said, "Oh, maybe." [00:15:00]
CLIENT: If I were to say, "You know what? Shut up. You have everything. You have no idea what it is like to," (inaudible at 00:15:07) or whatever. What would you feel?
THERAPIST: Dismissed.
CLIENT: Dismissed, yeah. What would your reaction be?
THERAPIST: Depends on my relationship to you.
CLIENT: Yeah. If we were friends.
THERAPIST: If we were friends, if we were good friends, a good friend would say, "Why do you feel the need to dismiss me?" If you're not good friends, the person will just be dismissed...
CLIENT: Yeah. [laughs]
THERAPIST: ...and leave.
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess, in the back [of my mind] (ph), I want to find out if you will actually dismiss yourself or if you'll be a good friend and ask me. [laughs] I should haven't that need to play games or keep people-I keep testing their friendship or their (inaudible at 00:16:10) or whatever.
THERAPIST: In saying that, "Look what you have. I don't have anything," you're talking about a state of injustice and that they're causing or facilitating their injustice.
CLIENT: Hmm.
THERAPIST: That's kind of part of the statement.
CLIENT: Yeah. How would they have caused that?
THERAPIST: Well, you're not only saying, "I don't feel treated fairly," or, "I haven't gotten a lot in life," you're saying, "Look what you've gotten and look what I haven't gotten." It's sort of like they're participating in the state of injustice. They're not just bystanders.
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:17:00]
THERAPIST: I think of that as such an important motivation. What we're talking about with you is you have a particular way of seeing yourself and feeling about yourself and feeling about yourself with relation to other people and the world around you, this identity of sort of depravation and injustice. ","P1-N400B11":"[00:18:10] There are all sorts of influences and motivations to keep it going, and all of those things are really important.
CLIENT: [laughs] You find that...?
THERAPIST: I think there's something so important about that. I don't think that only happens, but I think there's something very important in that.
CLIENT: I should stick to it?
THERAPIST: I like it. In some ways, it seems not very psychological, because it seems like, "But what about all the reasons that you're like the way you are?" We are talking about those things, so it's not like...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...we're sweeping them under the rug. I think there's a lot to be said for, "You know what? I just don't want to do this anymore. I'm sick of playing this role. I've played this role in every play for the last 30 years." [00:19:02]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: "Maybe there's a different role for me to play and learn."
CLIENT: Yeah. I had this very strong urge to have a core and go back to my core. I'm very attached to certain things. I would definitely be attached to this feeling. I probably desperately try to remember it, maybe because of the stuff that I'm writing right now. That's also going to end, at some point, ","P1-N400C51":"and then I have to move on to something else.
THERAPIST: You'd like a stack of cards, rather than just one.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. [00:21:00] I think, as an actor say, for example maybe there are certain actors that just go for one to the next and never have any memory that they played King Lear and now they're playing the jester [laughs] (inaudible at 00:21:20) it happens.
THERAPIST: We started by talking about if you really felt like you were an inside and invited...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...you'd feel like jelly.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Is there any other way you could feel?
CLIENT: I guess there could be, yeah. The possibilities are endless. (inaudible at 00:21:54) are endless. [laughs] I guess I could feel like a part of a jigsaw puzzle and see how I fit into the larger mosaic. [00:22:08] Is that right? [laughs] Is that what you said?
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: I would like not to just be a cactus. "Don't come close to me! [Stay away] (ph)!" I guess I said "jelly" because I guess I'm afraid that I'll get slapped around in any which way.
THERAPIST: By whom?
CLIENT: By the insiders, the other people. I don't know. Has that happened? Maybe it's happened. I guess in my childhood it's happened, where I so badly wanted to be in certain circles and just wasn't. [00:23:06] Then I was violently rejected. I'm very afraid of that. [laughs]
THERAPIST: Where?
CLIENT: I guess when I was age, I don't know, eight or nine or ten or eleven, around that time. We were renting this is in Nepal we were renting a room, a little apartment, from these people. They had a huge bungalow, a huge house, giant (ph) family: grandfather, grandmother, and then they had one ","P1-N400EB1":"son and his wife and one daughter who had a daughter and son. [00:24:01]
THERAPIST: Twelve?
CLIENT: No, really? No, I think 13 or something.
THERAPIST: Girls start puberty as early as ten or eleven.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It could depend. It could be 13...
CLIENT: Yeah, I think she was...
THERAPIST: Fourteen.
CLIENT: Yeah, [she was around that age] (ph).
THERAPIST: You felt she was your mother's confidant?
CLIENT: Yeah, and she was very nasty with me. Yeah. She put me through some very traumatic... [laughs] experiences. Well, first of all, there was that sexual thing. She would force me to do things. She would force all of us [laughs] [to do it] (ph), all her cousins to do things.
THERAPIST: Like what?
CLIENT: I've suppressed (00:25:52). [laughs] It involved getting in bed with her. I don't know, something. Touching her-I kind of remember. [00:26:01] I clearly have a sensory...I can remember her smell, I can remember her breasts and (inaudible at 00:26:09). [laughs]
THERAPIST: You never mentioned this before.
CLIENT: Yeah, I know. [laughs] Never come up.
THERAPIST: This was after what happened with the son?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. By this point, I felt like it wasn't like coercion or anything. It wasn't as violent. She wanted stuff done to her or maybe she did stuff to me, I can't remember. Yeah.
THERAPIST: I don't follow you. She did good things in what respect?
CLIENT: Well, helped me get rid of this bad habit.
THERAPIST: I see. Was she enamored with this girl?
CLIENT: Who, me?
THERAPIST: No, she. Your mom.
CLIENT: I don't know. I don't think so.
THERAPIST: She just liked her some way.
CLIENT: Yeah. She had a lot of problems (inaudible at 00:28:45) at home, this girl, and no one to talk to about it except my mom.
THERAPIST: The girl.
CLIENT: Yeah, and her cousins and her brother. At one point, for this festival, I asked my mom to buy me firecrackers. We didn't have much money. My mom was a teacher and I think for the point of trying (inaudible at 00:29:30) was also a teacher. Anyways, he was not there. He was out of town. She bought ","P1-N4012D1":"me firecrackers and she spent 20 rupees on them. [laughs] To her it was, "My God, you could have got vegetables for this instead," but she wanted to do this for me.
CLIENT: I guess I was also actually hurt. This woman caused me a lot of pain, a lot of misery, but my mom didn't see that. She was like, "Oh, you don't understand her. She has a lot of problems."
THERAPIST: Does the whole sexual piece seem less important? [00:35:03] It's important to me, but maybe it doesn't feel that way to you.
CLIENT: No, just in this context. I guess we were talking more about being insider and my fears of feeling like jelly. [laughs] In that context, that was one of the things.
THERAPIST: You don't want to say it because it's not true or you just don't want to say it?
CLIENT: Well, I'm not sure, because it happened so long ago and I misremember things. Maybe even suppressed it so I don't remember them. [00:36:00]
THERAPIST: I was thinking about him as you were speaking. What are your thoughts about that?
CLIENT: Well, this is so fucking colored by her daughter and that whole thing. If I take that piece away, I would say I was drawn to him in a platonic way. He kept saying, "I want to be your father," this and that, so I was drawn to him in that way. "Oh, poor, suffering soul [of a] (ph) poet. Poor guy, ","P1-N401591":"he's lonely and he's saying all these things. Maybe I could be his adopted daughter," goddaughter, whatever.
THERAPIST: My association to your not wanting to feel like an insider was then you would think, "What's my narrative now, then?"
CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. That's why I guess I would feel like a jelly.
THERAPIST: Okay. The jelly part, my association was that to your being vulnerable.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, yeah, that too.
THERAPIST: Which is not having-there's vulnerable and then there's just sort of feeling lost (inaudible at 00:41:57). "What's my narrative..."
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: "...who am I now? I don't know. I'm sitting on the inside of the club."
CLIENT: I feel like that would make me feel a lot more engaged. I guess this is a take away from Chris. Obviously, he doesn't feel like he has the narrative or whatever, but he does have this tool. He's an economist and he thinks about production relations. He thinks about all the things that [laughs] ","P1-N401771":"he writes about and teaches.
CLIENT: I can totally see how, in different, it could lead to nothing at all. It could lead good thing. It could lead to a disaster [laughs] as in the 80-year-old poet. I don't know who gave me that card, if it was me or it was him. I feel like it was mostly him and his daughter and his wife were like, ","P1-N4017D1":""Oh, you have nothing. You don't have any friends or family and no money. We're helping you out and giving you a place to stay." [laughs] "Therefore, we can do whatever we want with you." [00:44:01]
THERAPIST: "You're our slave"?
CLIENT: Yeah. Don't want that. I did try to change-like a little bird, I kept pecking at it and going, "No, I have family. I have friends. I have a little bit of money." [laughs]
CLIENT: I guess we didn't really talk about what I thought we would talk about. [laughs]
THERAPIST: Which is? [00:45:00]
CLIENT: Well, I think last time you said, "He wants you," and you [were excited] (ph) that was feeling-I was almost tearing up, because I thought of (inaudible at 00:45:10) [big can of worms] (ph) [laughs]. We can talk about that next time.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, I think we talked about some parts of it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You felt yourself tearing up?
CLIENT: Cheering up?
THERAPIST: Tearing up.
CLIENT: Yeah, last time. [laughs]
THERAPIST: Well, let's talk about this Monday, okay?
CLIENT: Yeah! [laughs]
THERAPIST: Okay, great.
CLIENT: Okay, have a good weekend.
THERAPIST: Thank you, you too.
CLIENT: Bye.
THERAPIST: Bye, (inaudible at 00:45:53).
