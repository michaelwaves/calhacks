DESCRIPTION: Client discusses how she is planning a party for her boyfriend, but feels awkward inviting people she doesn't know. Client discusses her childhood and the socioeconomic difference between her and her neighbors.
CLIENT: So I guess the schedule... I’ll start there in June and, you said you’ll only be here for two weeks in June.
THERAPIST: Well, three weeks. Let me, let me get my schedule and we’ll... (pause) Let’s see... Yeah, I’ll be here the 2nd, the 9th, and the 16th, those three weeks. (client affirms) And I should, I’ll have to confirm next week, but I should have a 5:10 available, ten after five, ","P1-N4000D1":"on Tuesdays. Is that something that you might be able to use? (client affirms) Okay. Would you need, so, do you, yeah. Would you want... (pause) Let me see... I might also be able to do a 5:30 on Thursday, if you wanted to do the Tuesday and Thursday. Is that a possibility? (client affirms) Okay, let ","P1-N4000D2":"me... I need to double-check that. I think I could do that. I’ve... The other option would be potentially an 8:30 on Monday morning. [00:02:02]
CLIENT: Oh, this is for June or...?
THERAPIST: This is for June, yeah.
CLIENT: Okay. Um... Yeah. I have to see how things go in June like...
THERAPIST: Well, that’s what you’re talking about, right? Are you talking about June? (client affirms) Yeah, okay.
CLIENT: Start there... The second, probably. So, Tuesday, Thursday, or Monday.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I think, so Tue , again, I need to, the Tuesday time, I need to confirm, but I’m pretty sure I’ll have the 5:10 on Tuesday. Then Thursday, I think it’s either 5:30 or 5:40. I just need to confirm that. Will one of those two times...?
CLIENT: Yeah, both will work.
THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah, my due date is the 21st (client affirms), so I plan on being here the week of the 16th, and then, yeah, then I’ll be out starting the 23rd. (client affirms) So let me, I’ll confirm all of those for next week, but we’ll, so we’ll keep our regular schedule ","P1-N4001D1":"through May and then look at that for June. (client affirms) Okay? Very good. Then, in terms of my schedule coming back, it’s a little bit, I might need to figure out a few things, but we’ll, I’ll definitely be in touch by, I would say, mid-July and then we can kind of take it from there. [00:03:25]
CLIENT: Sure! Not a problem. (pause) Yeah. (chuckles) (sighs) (pause) Still haven’t told my mom about (chuckles) my plans and my job and stuff. (chuckles) I think I saw her last... Saturday; yeah, maybe Saturday. I’m trying to... probably kind of... so... (sighs) Yeah, I was thinking about ","P1-N4001F1":"what we said last time... (pause) about like, addressing the emotional like, underbelly of the conflicts. You know, I said, “I thought I had said everything I wanted to say about the situation,” but then I guess I just did feel weird and new, I guess, to acknowledge like, you know, that ","P1-N4001F2":"my ideal or my, kind goal to kind of take care of her and... So I just, (sighs) I guess surprised by that, that, you know, that was there and that’s like, a foundational sort of thing for me, but then also, the realization that that’s just one narrative and life is much bigger than that ","P1-N4001F3":"narrative. [00:05:53]
THERAPIST: Where did you go?
CLIENT: I was thinking what more to say about it. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: (pause) You don’t want to be seen; how do you mean?
CLIENT: I don’t know. Like, all these people, they are his friends and like, I feel judged by them or whatever. (chuckles) So... But it turns out they are quiet. They’re not as judgmental or not judgmental in the same way as... like, Chris’s friends or how I perceived them, or how ","P1-N400391":"I perceive Chris’s friends, so... [00:14:57]
THERAPIST: By having it?
CLIENT: Yeah. It’s like, why do I have it, and now it’s almost like another thing to manage and, you know, think about, and perform at, and... to fail at, if something goes wrong. (chuckles) I don’t know... anxiety.
THERAPIST: You’re very quiet today.
CLIENT: Yeah. I didn’t really sleep last night, I think. I made some coffee. (chuckles) Yeah, if I can’t think of what to say. (sighs) I just want to hibernate for like, the next month... and not see people or... (chuckles)
THERAPIST: And you would write during that hibernation?
CLIENT: What?
THERAPIST: You would write during the hibernation?
CLIENT: Yeah, I have, every single day I need to get some writing done. Otherwise... (chuckles) Yeah. [00:21:34]
THERAPIST: Contact with other people is very stimulating for you, and sometimes over-stimulating.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I mean like, it’s like, you know, where maybe introverts think that, are you giving too much of yourself to people and, you know, you don’t want to do that. I guess that, this, at certain points what I need to think and write are I really early cannot spend. And my brain ","P1-N400531":"is just occupied, you know? Like, I can’t do stuff that takes brain capacity, and people take brain capacity. I mean, I’m trying not to, but I try to be all like, like a breezy 27-year old with like very, you know, like a very clean slate and very few impressions or knots in their (chuckles) ","P1-N400532":"brain or whatever, so... Like, just meet people and, you know like, breeze by. But I’m not like that. (chuckles) [00:22:46]
THERAPIST: So why do you try to do be like that?
CLIENT: No, I, I’m... well, maybe at some point I wanted to be like that. I was tired of being by myself and thought, it became quite poisonous, it did. (chuckles) Two years ago, but I feel like I’m different from then. So... Maybe I’ve had too much people time and not enough “me” ","P1-N400571":"time. I mean, it’s just, you know like, I need to get work done, so... I feel like people are getting in the way. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: How do you mean?
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: You said “it reminds me of my childhood.”
CLIENT: Well, it was, you know like, I was an only child, so I would spend a lot of time with myself. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Did you like it? [00:30:49]
CLIENT: Yeah. I was mostly reading Nancy Drew’s. (chuckles) You know, I mean, that was awesome, so... Or, yeah. Reading and, yeah, eating something, or just reading. (chuckles) Yeah, I remember that and I feel like... at first there was my Mom, and then there was my Dad. It was like... you know, ","P1-N400711":"why? (chuckles) He should not have, he should never have come back into my life. (chuckles) But... then there were books, you know, and that was good, you know, great.
THERAPIST: What was weird about them?
CLIENT: Well, I didn’t have any friends like, you know, where we first lived, where I was, like the house that I grew up in, until I was, I don’t know, 10 or something, or whatever. Then we moved to a different part of town and there were kids my age, or close to my age. They even at school ","P1-N400771":"like, people were... What I remember is people getting me into trouble, people not talking to me, people looking down on my clothes and shoes, teachers being nasty and like... Yeah, people not eating lunch with me, or people... And then the neighborhood kids being very, very, very wealthy compared to ","P1-N400772":"me and like, them being really mean to me about me not having money.
THERAPIST: You were a target.
CLIENT: Yeah. Again, I’m not trying to like, say I didn’t have any agency. I did and... (sighs) I manipulated, tried to manipulate people I could, maybe like my mom like, you know, like going and like, running up to her crying and telling her, “She did this, she did that.” (chuckles) ","P1-N4007D1":"Instead of holding back or like, trying to fight back on my own. I don’t know, I was told I was emotionally blackmailing my mom or something.
THERAPIST: By who, by your mom?
CLIENT: Probably, or one of her friends, or my Dad, or someone. (therapist affirms) Yeah, my dad like, as soon as he came on like, my world just like, went from white to black. (chuckles) Yeah, he came and I feel like the next day like, okay, he might have been nice to me one day and then the next day ","P1-N400811":"he was like, burning my books and like... telling my Mom, I’m cunning and I lie and (chuckles)... It’s like, I was, yeah. I went from being in hell into being in hell, so... It’s like, you know, you’re aware of only nice things and nice motivations and you know like, even when ","P1-N400812":"you’re doing something like, you know, telling your mom you need this or you know, “Oh, I can’t move; can you get me this?” You know, that being innocent and the child’s play; from that turning into, from his vantage point, evil and cunning and manipulative and, you know ","P1-N400813":"(chuckles)... I had like, lost my innocence as soon as he came on the scene. [00:35:56]
THERAPIST: How old were you?
CLIENT: Six, I think.
THERAPIST: This was the first time he came back. Didn’t he then come back later?
CLIENT: Yeah, he was always coming and going, so...
THERAPIST: Had you ever met him before? Or did you remember meeting him?
CLIENT: I don’t remember anything. The first time I saw him, yeah.
THERAPIST: When you were six. (client affirms) Did you know anything about him? Did your mother ever talk about him?
CLIENT: No, I don’t really remember. I might have like, asked her once, that I might have been aware of. “Other kids have dads,” but I don’t remember her answer or anything. (pause) Are we done now?
THERAPIST: No! We still have time. (client affirms)
CLIENT: Yeah, I wonder if I identified with David Copperfield. I probably did. (chuckles) I’m wondering how many children do.
THERAPIST: Is there anything particular that comes to mind about David Copperfield that you would identify with?
CLIENT: I’ve forgotten the specifics, but you know like, him not having a dad, and then having a really harsh step-dad that he hates. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I don’t remember the story at all.
CLIENT: Well, he’s born to a really young, pretty mom. His dad is like, dead before he’s born. His aunt comes over to adopt him, because the aunt thinks that he’s going to be a girl. But soon as he’s a boy, she’s like, “I’m out of here!” The young mom, ","P1-N4009F1":"then, kind of befriends this man. He’s nasty and sends David away to like, a boarding school type of scenario. Then I forget specifics. It’s a big book. (chuckles) [00:39:07]
THERAPIST: Jealous of your dad when he came back?
CLIENT: Yeah. But, yeah. But then, I think he pretty quickly took up that narrative before I could even articulate it, because, you know, I’m a six-year-old child and he was a 36-year-old man or whatever. He was like, he was jealous. He was like, “I’m jealous of you guys and you guys ","P1-N400A51":"are always teaming up and bonding.” (chuckles) I would secretly think, “That’s right, you know. You can never have what I have with my Mom because, plainly, evidently, you just don’t get her, you just don’t love her. You’re a fucking douche bag!” (chuckles) ","P1-N400A52":"You know, sad, but sad, yeah. I wasn’t actually happy about that, you know. [00:40:38]
THERAPIST: Do you feel like your mom mostly aligned with you or where did you feel her allegiances lay?
CLIENT: Well, it’s like the same way. I mean like, from my vantage point, from my perspective it was like, she was fair game or she could do whatever she wanted to like... I feel like... It was sad that she aligned with me... or needed to align with me, you know? I wonder if I thought it was sad. ","P1-N400A91":"You know, this is complex. Yeah. (pause) Yeah, she mostly aligned with me, but it wasn’t like... What does that mean? Like, took my side?
THERAPIST: Well, I mean, it could mean a lot of things. You were describing your dad feeling that you and your mom were kind of like a unit (client affirms) and that he was jealous of that unit. (client affirms) So I was wondering, from your vantage point, did you feel that’s what she was doing? ","P1-N400AB1":"Or was she... yeah. [00:41:40]
CLIENT: But it was like, circumstance. I mean, he wasn’t there. He just, you know, came and left, and came and left. So, if he wanted to align with my mom, and if he wanted to be a unit with my mom, you know, he should have done something about it, you know.
THERAPIST: How did she feel about him coming back, when you were six? Do you know?
CLIENT: She was conflicted. I think she wanted to, she has a weird narrative. She was like, “I wanted you to have a child , I wanted you to have a father, I didn’t want my brother to take care of me, so I thought it was best to have a husband.” (chuckles) Now that I’m like, ","P1-N400B11":"an adult and I have had sex, I’m like, I think there (chuckles) might be some other reasons as well, you know? Like, she might have been lonely, you know? Like... yeah. She has this martyr’s narrative, just, you know. (chuckles) [00:42:47]
THERAPIST: Do you think she liked having him around?
CLIENT: (sighs) I think there must have been, they must have had like some good times, you know. But I don’t know if she actually... spends too much time thinking and regretting. I mean, I’m sure she regretted it, when things were bad, when he beat me or like, when we were fighting, but... ","P1-N400B51":"I think she was just so busy and overwhelmed by like, jobs. He was a drunk and like, there would be something going on, like affairs and things. And like, they would get really, really... you know... (chuckles) complicated for her to deal with, so... (pause) I don’t know why I brought this up! ","P1-N400B52":"(chuckles) I forget why I’m going in this direction. [00:44:02]
THERAPIST: Well, you started by talking about wanting to retreat. (client affirms) And then you thought about what it was like as a child, when you were on your own a lot, by yourself alone.
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess like, I haven’t had that since I was... the last time I had it, I think I was like, 15 and I had just come to the U.S. and I had my own room (chuckles) and then a computer and then books and stuff.
THERAPIST: Cecelia (ph), we’re going to need to stop for today. (client affirms) I will see you on Monday.
CLIENT: Okay. 10:15? (pause) Okay. Have a good weekend!
THERAPIST: Take care, thank you!
