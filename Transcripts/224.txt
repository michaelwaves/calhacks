DESCRIPTION: Client discusses feeling overwhelmed by the amount of work she needs to complete for a class that doesn't seem worthwhile. Client discusses the difficulties she is having in choosing who to date.
CLIENT: Hi. [5:09]
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.
CLIENT: Sorry (inaudible at 5:14). I had my (inaudible at 5:23).
THERAPIST: Okay. (pause) I got both your e-mails.
CLIENT: Oh, okay. (chuckles) Yeah, you responded (inaudible).
THERAPIST: You usually don’t cancel sessions because you have just other things to do.
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: I said you usually don’t cancel sessions because you have other things to do.
CLIENT: Yeah, I know. Yesterday I was just getting really overwhelmed. Everything was bothering me (chuckling). My life feels very fragmented. It’s not just one giant thing taking up all my time. It’s, like, little, little things, and (pause). Yeah, so, it’s just like, ooh—I ","P1-N4001B1":"had to finish an assignment. It was due yesterday, and I didn’t finish it. I was up until 2 on Monday night, and I couldn’t finish it. I just feel like I’m (sighs) not able to get a handle on things on my schedule, and all that. I’m falling behind. I got an extension, but I just ","P1-N4001B2":"wanted to devote—I mean, I need chunks of time for writing, I can’t just do it on the fly. I have to sit down for several hours. Okay, my day is so fragmented. I don’t get to start writing when I have therapy until noon, and I don’t like that. So, days I don’t have therapy ","P1-N4001B3":"I can start early. (chuckling) It just felt like it was something in the way, and that’s why I was late. [00:07:18]
THERAPIST: Well, I’m not at all implying I’m taking it personally. I understand that, with you, this feeling that you have, which you do get a lot—I understand there’s a practicality. You need time to write, and I don’t want to minimize that. But like, where you feel overwhelmed, ","P1-N4001F1":"and you’re taking on too much, and then you have to drop everything. And then you get worried you don’t have money, so you take on a full-time job. And you feel the full-time job is too much and then you want to quit. Like, modulating or moderating can feel hard for you sometimes. [00:08:09]
CLIENT: Yeah, I don’t know how to moderate. I didn’t moderate. (pause)
THERAPIST: Well, I can see it in the reverse. It’s hard to moderate when you feel overwhelmed and flooded.
CLIENT: Hmm. (pause) Yeah, I was feeling flooded yesterday (pause). I was just standing at my calendar, looking. Where did the time fly? What am I doing? I’m trying to analyze what exactly I did last month. Because I felt much better in February. I felt—I had a deadline, which was great. ","P1-N400251":"I was working towards something, and just this one-time thing was occupying me. I think that was better for me. Now it’s only, “do this, do that. Help that person, help this person.” I just (chuckles), I just don’t like that. I don’t know why, I feel overwhelmed. [00:09:19]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean people do think that way. I think your cost\/benefit analysis tends to be in very short increments of time.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Like, you don’t always take the big picture or the long overview of cost\/benefit. It’s like cost\/benefit at the moment. Like what’s the cost of going to therapy at this moment? Not, oh maybe therapy can help me with this problem of moderating myself, so that the long-term ","P1-N4002D1":"benefit actually outweighs it. Not saying you should feel that way, but that’s one way to think about it. At the moment, it’s cutting up your day.
CLIENT: Well both are true, aren’t they?
THERAPIST: They are both true.
CLIENT: Yeah, in the sense that I do see the long-term benefit of therapy. Which is why, guess what? I’ve been coming to you for two years (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Do you feel like I’m not acknowledging that?
CLIENT: No, no, no, I’m acknowledging that (chuckles). I’m telling myself. This is an argument I’m having myself (inaudible). But, and that’s also true, that it does cut up my day. Both are true and how do I make a nice decision based on both facts? Like taking both facts into ","P1-N400371":"consideration? (pause) [00:12:04]
THERAPIST: Well, it seems like it’s also tied with feeling overcommitted at times. Kind of bogged down by your commitments.
CLIENT: Yeah, I’ve tried to handle that. I mean (pause) I feel bad about, like today, we don’t have this class and I feel underwhelmed. It’s at nights on Wednesdays. And we don’t have that, but the teacher wants a 20-minute conference with every student. So, she was sending a ","P1-N4003B1":"signup sheet around. And I didn’t sign up, and she was like “So you didn’t sign up.” And I just looked at it and looked at her, and was like, “Do you come in on campus on Tuesdays?” (chuckling) And she’s like “No I don’t,” and she’s like ","P1-N4003B2":"“I know it’s hard for you to come in for just 20 minutes to meet with me.” And I was like, “Yep.” (chuckles) I really, like, really violently feel against it. I sent her an e-mail last night saying my back hurts and can we do it another time? And I’m not lying, I ","P1-N4003B3":"did hurt my back. I mean, it’s a two-hour commute, and it makes no sense right now when I’m so pressed for time. So I just really feel oppressed, you know? To do this (laughing). So I’m just not going to do it. I’m a very conscientious person when it comes to education and teachers. ","P1-N4003B4":"I don’t even call my professors by their first name, which is the American tradition. I call everyone “professor” and “teacher” and give them respect. This was very uncharacteristic of me to talk to her like this and give her attitude. This is unprecedented. But I just ","P1-N4003B5":"feel so strongly that this class is a waste of my time (laughing) Spending two hours to see her for 20 minutes is just not worth it. I don’t want to do it, so I’m not going to do it. I’m just surprised at myself for acting this way, but I’m just like (chuckling), if I do it, ","P1-N4003B6":"I’ll feel horrible the whole time (laughing). I don’t like cursing. [00:14:42]
THERAPIST: Well, part of the reason the world isn’t giving it to you is because you signed up for other things. And I’ve seen this before, you sign up for something, and then you feel imposed upon by the very thing that you actually sought to sign up for.
CLIENT: I know. (laughing)
THERAPIST: It’s not like taxes. Whether you seek it out or not, you have to pay taxes. It’s not like something you were like—
CLIENT: Yeah. So what’s the solution here? (pause) Yeah, I don’t know (pause)
THERAPIST: Well, I’ll give you an answer to what’s the solution. I’m not sure what this would look like, but when I hear you in these modes, I kind of—and also, when you talk about having these very strong reactions to people outside, and doing things that later you regret, I ","P1-N400491":"kind of just want to slow you down. Just a little bit. [00:17:48]
CLIENT: How do I slow down?
THERAPIST: Right, so that’s a good question.
CLIENT: Breathe and do yoga? (laughing) I could (pause). No, I’m learning. So, on Monday—Monday was when I was going to brilliantly sit down, get glued to my chair, and just write. But, as soon as I left this place, I got an e-mail that was like, oh, this profile that I wrote, I did a really ","P1-N4004F1":"shitty job on, and the professor was so mad. So that took up until almost like 3 or 4. I told Chris (sp?) I’d do yoga with him (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Speaking of yoga (chuckling) [00:18:48]
CLIENT: Yeah, so I was like, “Oh, I have this huge deadline tomorrow, and it’s already like 3 or 4, so I should just sit here and write.” And he was like “I know, yeah, but you know in these moments, I feel like an abandoned child.” So I was like, “Okay, alright. ","P1-N400531":"Let’s do it.” (chuckling) And then I didn’t get back writing until 10. So (laughing) you know, that was a whole day. If I think about it, like if I stress myself out, I would just pull my hair right now, thinking, “What? How did I do that?” I’m trying not to think ","P1-N400532":"that way, and I’m telling myself, it was really important. Chris, he really needs to take care of his body, and he hasn’t at all done it all his life. This is a good thing, helping him do this. He’s helped me out so much, and I cannot be an intellectual match for him, but at least ","P1-N400533":"in other superficial areas. Perhaps I think they’re important and he might not think they’re important right now. I should do this. And it’s good for me too, so, you know. (pause) This is one way that I’m slowing down [00:20:15]
THERAPIST: Did you feel like you couldn’t be honest with her?
CLIENT: I mean she knows, she said it herself, right? Come and see me for 20 minutes, is, you know, whatever, I don’t know what she said. But yeah, it is! (laughing)
THERAPIST: So it’s not only that, but it’s different than you’re not going to be on campus, and it takes a long time to commute there. Maybe not everybody is commuting that far just to see her for 20 minutes.
CLIENT: Yeah, exactly, but I am— [00:21:23]
THERAPIST: Right, but it didn’t seem like you felt you could tell her that. Like actually, “It’s going to be over two hours for this 20 minute meeting. I don’t think that’s going to work for me. I really appreciate your time, though. Maybe we could find a time where I’m ","P1-N4005F1":"going to be on campus, anyway.” It didn’t seem like you felt like you could be that direct with her.
CLIENT: Well, I think I felt that she knew. Because she said that, “I know coming for only 20 minutes doesn’t seem to make sense,” or something. So she must have known I only come to campus for that. [00:22:18]
THERAPIST: Maybe, I don’t know. Maybe
CLIENT: Yeah, I’ve already made up my mind not to go to the next two classes. So... (laughing)
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: They’re just workshops and people are workshopping poetry. And it’s like, super underwhelming for me. It’s super underwhelming. The whole time I’m trying to text, or just on my phone. (laughing)
THERAPIST: So this is part of a bigger problem. You’re feeling like she’s wasting your time.
CLIENT: Mmhmm. I mean, I’m not like personally. I can totally understand the structure of the class, and this and that. It’s just not a good fit for me, you know? And I took this class thinking, it’s a poetry class. I was thinking, I write poetic prose anyway. This will help me to ","P1-N4006F1":"think in that area. I’ve never written poetry so I thought it would be challenging. And it was mildly challenging, but not as much as I thought it was. It’s geared more towards undergraduates, and stuff. This is all, even in the larger scheme of things, feeling somewhat underwhelmed by various ","P1-N4006F2":"things at Amherst because it’s just not—like the intellectual quotient of the classes there are just not the same caliber as at Columbia, which was the best for me. And then, after Columbia, you have lower MSU. And then even lower, Amherst. (laughing) So it’s like I’m climbing ","P1-N4006F3":"down (laughing). [00:23:55]
THERAPIST: And which speaks to the initial issue I raised, is that you chose to do a degree in that you feel is useful in some ways.
CLIENT: Yeah, it’s very, very different. Like there’s much more practical knowledge. It’s really actually helped me to be a writer, which is what I wanted.
THERAPIST: How?
CLIENT: I’m actually talking to this girl who’s kind of the same position as me. She got into both MSU and Amherst, so I talked to her for an hour, telling her how both my experiences were. But, like, it’s a three-year program, and even if I have a job or not—I should just talk ","P1-N400771":"about myself, not (inaudible at 00:24:43). Yeah, so this was a three-year commitment, which is a lot. So that’s overwhelming in that sense. It might be underwhelming in its direct instruction, but the three-year time period is overwhelming. To be poor for that long and thinking that it’s ","P1-N400772":"not just the degree I’m pursuing, it’s the craft. It’s the mindset that I have to cultivate, of trying to be a writer. I’m supposed to do that, I feel, at least for that long, and develop, or like, cultivate this community that I’m part of to students and teachers. The ","P1-N400773":"habit of meeting deadlines, the habit of once it’s done, it’s not really done. You have to revise and think about that, and meet with the teachers to think to make a plan for revision. [00:25:43]
THERAPIST: Well you feel trapped very easily. And so, there are things you do that are not top of your list. It’s not like you live this sort of hedonistic life, and that’s it. When you feel sort of imposed upon or trapped, that’s when it’s very hard for you. [00:29:33]
CLIENT: Yeah, and I think that everyone deals with that emotion in a much better way than I do. Even Chris, who really feels this way, you know? Trapped. But even he wouldn’t do any of the crazy, drastic, dramatic things that I do. Such as breaking up with a person that you feel trapped by (laughing). ","P1-N400851":"Like basically breaking up, right? That sums it up. Quitting a job is like breaking up, too.
THERAPIST: Getting away from...
CLIENT: Yeah, just running away. Not running, maybe. Yeah, running away slash breaking that bond, connection. [00:30:28]
THERAPIST: What do you mean?
CLIENT: Just because I’m bored in someone’s class, doesn’t mean I should hate them and never want to see them again, right? (laughing)
THERAPIST: The two aren’t necessarily the same.
CLIENT: Yeah (pause). But with my job, I feel that could be one way of looking at it. Or maybe there’s another way of looking at it that I stay with them for at least a year, and then my last job at least two years. Three years, actually, yeah. Two (laughing). I don’t know, two or three. ","P1-N400931":"But I stayed until I could just not take it anymore. [00:31:47]
THERAPIST: You clearly stick things out. I mean, you’ve gotten the degrees you’ve gotten. It’s not like you leave after the first week of a program. You stick things out. You stick relationships out. You stick things out. You’ve had jobs. It’s not that you’re incapable ","P1-N400971":"of doing it, nor is it that you don’t do it. It’s simply that there are times that the intensity of the feelings you’re dealing with all the time, and maybe sometimes not making the best decision about leaving too quickly. Or maybe just believing wrongly, in a sense. I don’t ","P1-N400972":"mean to be judgmental, but feeling like you need to get out of there, versus just sort of leaving and moving on with a little more grace, which you have. [00:32:54]
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah! Like telling the professor, yes, actually, when she said whatever she said, and I thought I was making her feel bad instead of feeling that way I would have said, you know, “Yes, you’re right professor. It takes me two hours, actually, and really I cannot do this right ","P1-N400991":"now, at this time, this semester. So could we work something else out?” (laughing) Being more graceful about it, you know? Instead of panicking and hitting whatever panic button I can reach for.
THERAPIST: Right, it’s the panic, it’s the feelings. It’s not simply that you’re doing something wrong, it’s that the intensity of the feelings that you have, feeling panicked or trapped, or you’ve got to get out of here. Feeling forced. What is she going to do? Come ","P1-N4009B1":"to your house and hold a gun to your head and make you come (inaudible due to CLIENT’s laughter at 00:33:56)?
CLIENT: It does feel like that.
THERAPIST: I know, I know.
CLIENT: It’s like she’s holding a gun to my head. Like, “sit here until 9:30 p.m.”
THERAPIST: I know, well, in part because you see people as having power over you that they don’t have. Some people have influence, like you have a boss, they could fire you. It’s not like no one has any influence over you. But you do see people as having power over you that they don’t ","P1-N400A31":"necessarily have. They can’t make you come somewhere. [00:34:30]
CLIENT: And even when they do, how do I act with grace? Like this one time, Nelson (sp?) was so insistent. It was Friday, and again, same situation. I had stuff to write and I hadn’t got to it until like 3, 4 p.m. in the evening. I was having—yeah, I just didn’t even start my day until ","P1-N400A51":"then. I was having lunch, and it went on for a while. And the friend just seemed to be like (mimicking friend in a high-pitched voice, inaudible words at first) let’s walk around! And I was looking at my phone, like, “God” I was having a good time, but you know, feeling the pressure.
THERAPIST: What do you think helped you to do it in that situation?
CLIENT: I have no idea. I cried, I think that helped, actually. I was just fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting, and then I just couldn’t take it anymore, so I burst. And then, it was just me and my computer, and my work, and I was just like, “Okay, one word at a time.” And before ","P1-N400AD1":"I knew it, it was 8 (pause). [00:37:22]
THERAPIST: Well, aside from the particular issues that we’re talking about, about feeling trapped. And I think about, is you’re feeling suffocated, too. In general, you just feel things really intensely, which is not a bad thing. There’s definitely many benefits to it, and it probably ","P1-N400B11":"really enhances your writing a great deal. The question is, how can you manage it so that it doesn’t interfere with things? And it’s sort of natural when you feel something intensely. Our feelings are there to guide us to do something. A tiger is chasing us in the forest and we’re ","P1-N400B12":"like, oh, that’s so interesting. We could die, so our feelings are there to inform us and cause us to act. It’s kind of like an evolutionarily good things. In some situations, it could cause you to act sort of prematurely. And that’s what you face a lot of the time. You sort of feel ","P1-N400B13":"this imminent danger and you need to do something. It’s hard to sort of just take a step, calm down, cry. Do whatever you need to do to figure it out. There’s no tiger chasing you down. [00:38:54]
CLIENT: I get so (ph) I guess worried about, in terms of really big decisions that actually involve feelings, and in my case I really don’t know what I was feeling (ph). Whether it’s job, or something very practical, it’s all about feelings (chuckling). Like which job do I take on, ","P1-N400B31":"if I do end up getting some offer from somewhere. I don’t know if that’ll happen, but I don’t really go by feelings.
THERAPIST: I don’t think it’s the feelings that are the problem, it’s the urgency sometimes. That you feel that you need to act.
CLIENT: Yeah, like Chris was saying last night, “okay, in the summer, I will formally break up with you. And then, I’ll start dating other people while your underwear’s still in my drawers, you know?” (laughing) So I was like, okay (laughing). It was funny, so weird. And then, ","P1-N400B71":"soon after, he said that while we were walking back from the store. Nelson called and he was like, “Yeah, no, I want to wait (ph).” Then I walked back to Chris, and then I was like “Don’t break up with me!” Feeling this panic. I couldn’t breathe, I felt like I was ","P1-N400B72":"going to throw up. Like, panicking, you know? I said, “don’t break up with me,” this and that. “Date other people, but still need me. Call me” (laughing). [00:40:38]
THERAPIST: But you don’t do that in all cases. You’re not chronically acting rashly. You do that sometimes. But you don’t revamp your life from week to week. [00:41:58]
THERAPIST: There’s actually a lot of stability in your life. It doesn’t feel that way, but it certainly looks like that way.
CLIENT: Like a three-year program.
THERAPIST: Yeah, you’re in your third degree. You completed, not including your undergraduate, you’re in your third degree. The two you completed, and you’re in the process of it. Your relationship with Chris I know is very back and forth, but you’ve been with him for quite some ","P1-N400C31":"time. I think it’s much more of a feeling than it is—like you have periods where you’re sort of running off last minute to Ohio. But there’s a lot of stability in your life, too. [00:42:59]
CLIENT: And now it’s alright (ph) that’s becoming stable (chuckling). Which is weird (pause).
THERAPIST: You have a hard time feeling settled internally.
CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe I don’t want to feel settled. It might mean something.
THERAPIST: Mmhmm. What do you think it might mean?
CLIENT: Permanence, or, I don’t know. Like how do you describe like feeling unsettled internally?
THERAPIST: I guess...probably there’s a lot of ways to think about it, but I was thinking in response to sort of feeling like things are changing every moment. as a contrast to that. [00:44:02]
CLIENT: (Pause) I don’t know, I can’t articulate it. The best I can do is, it’s like the sensation, and maybe the sensation is also a temporary thing. It’s not permanent. Like the sensation of saying this, and knowing...I feel that way about my project, and it’s happened ","P1-N400D11":"very recently (laughing). Well, it’s happened, but it just wasn’t a nebulus. It was a bunch of dark clouds I was gathering and hanging for like two years. And now that it’s in physical form in front of me, it has very real structure and stuff. And I’ve been looking at it and ","P1-N400D12":"saying this, okay, this, this. Day to day to day. That feels settled (chuckling). Intermittently (ph) settled. I mean it’s still temporary, because this will be that. I will be able to see it from my rear-view mirror. And there will be something else that will be this. [00:45:40]
THERAPIST: Okay Cecelia, I think we need to stop for today. So, you had e-mailed me about Monday. Are you still wanting to cancel?
CLIENT: Yeah, I have a thing at 11 (laughing).
THERAPIST: Do you want to find another time to meet that week?
CLIENT: Um, okay. So I don’t know, because like—
THERAPIST: It’s up to you.
THERAPIST: Yep. Mmhmm.
CLIENT: And then again, on Thursday and Friday I have something.
THERAPIST: So, okay. So you want to cancel next Monday. The following week is the week where I’m not here that Monday. I could meet that Thursday if you want. Would you like to do that?
CLIENT: Sure, yeah.
THERAPIST: We talked about that. I have a 10:15 available that Thursday. Okay, so I’m going to see you next Wednesday, and then again the following Wednesday and Thursday, and then back to the regular schedule.
CLIENT: Okay, sounds good.
THERAPIST: Okay, very good. If you have something different, please let me know. I didn’t get who’s paying for February, do you have a payment (ph) for February? I certainly don’t want to double charge you for that month. Let me take a look. My books are usually pretty up to date, ","P1-N400EB1":"but that certainly doesn’t mean I don’t make mistakes (pause). The last time you made a check, you made it, I think... [00:47:21]
CLIENT: Yeah, I paid for February.
THERAPIST: You did, because usually...did you make it the beginning of March?
CLIENT: No, in the middle of February. No, okay, maybe not. It says December\/Jan copay. 180.
THERAPIST: Okay, yeah, so I think that was for December and January. I don’t think that was for February.
CLIENT: Okay, so (pause).
THERAPIST: If you want to pay me for March, that’s fine. Usually I just ask for the payment at the end of the following month. So technically March isn’t due until the end of this month. If you want to pay me for February and March, that’s fine. If you want to pay just for February, ","P1-N400F71":"that’s fine.
CLIENT: Yeah, what’s the month (ph)?
THERAPIST: I think for both months, it’s $130 for both months.
CLIENT: Okay, so today is the 10th, right?
THERAPIST: 9th.
CLIENT: $130?
THERAPIST: $130, mmhmm. And that’s through the end of March (pause at 00:48:39). I’ll put that in paid for March.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Thank you. Okay, take care Cecelia.
CLIENT: You too. Bye, have a good weekend (ph)
THERAPIST: Bye-bye. [00:49:35]
