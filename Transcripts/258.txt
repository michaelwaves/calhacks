DESCRIPTION: Client discusses feeling pressured to take a full-time job, over her preferred part-time job. Client also discusses the uncertainty of her relationship status.
THERAPIST: Hi.
CLIENT: Hi. Sorry, I’m late. My previous schedule was like…that Tuesday thing I was like. I had a sneaking suspicion that you meant that the same [inaudible – 02:12] or something. So. But I think now I will be able to have everything straight because I just quit my job.
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: Yeah. Just like an hour ago. I had a meeting with my bosses and…all three of them. So and then…it was kind of nasty, but…
THERAPIST: Nasty how?
CLIENT: Well just like I wasn’t able to articulate myself very well and I wasn’t, I guess, very professional, so they weren’t very professional. Like I should have just said, “I’m sorry, but I cannot make this work so I’m giving my notice.” It kind of went along ","P1-N400151":"the lines of, “I cannot make this work and I am too distracted.” I got in to needless details and I made it…I was trying to be contrite. I was trying to kind of hope that they would have part-time work for me, like, but, they’re like so pressed for time. It’s a very very ","P1-N400152":"fat lady around my organization. They’re always running around like chickens with their heads cut off so they didn’t even really pause to say, “Oh, congratulations,” or you know, whatever, you know, and “Good luck.” They were just like, you know, “Okay, post ","P1-N400153":"the position now,” you know. So it’s kind of strange because you work for them for two years and they’re already just talking about replacing me.
THERAPIST: So this is the place that you worked at part-time and then went full-time, and then you decided to leave?
CLIENT: Yeah because I’m just…I realize that just within a week that I just cannot balance school and work and writing. And now some people might even say I don’t need school, but you know, I think rather than being in a full-time job, it’s better to be in school because it’s ","P1-N4001B1":"just the environment. Like, I feel like I’m more productive, I’m more creative in an environment that kind of…in a learning environment. So. It’s probably better to be in school. But…
THERAPIST: That’s a big deal not to be paying her rent.
CLIENT: Yeah, just not going to think about it and deal with it that way because like she says she’ll get a new apartment and if she gets employment she’ll be able to take care of herself. I feel very irresponsible, but like I just cannot put this aside because I feel like I’ve come ","P1-N400211":"this far, you know; I’ve invested time and [inaudible – 05:54] and I’ve shown it to people and talking about it and I’ve shown it to an agent who says she’s…she’d love to look at the finished product. And I feel like now that I’ve made a commitment I have ","P1-N400212":"to follow through. I have to give myself enough time to do it.
THERAPIST: It just seems like such a big change. We were talking for so long about your feeling guilty and you’re feeling so responsible for taking care of your mother, and it just like sort of seems so sudden.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know. I mean it is sudden. It’s a big change. I do feel irresponsible for her, but I want to be…I want to see if she can take care of herself, you know. Like both of us have this fear. Like she does and I have this fear too that she cannot…she won’t ","P1-N400291":"be able to take care of herself. Like you keep saying, you know, what is the worst that can happen? I just completely shut off when you say that. And I’m like I don’t want to think about that. So we’re just like not only just following through and dialogue would actually fall in to ","P1-N400292":"practice and seeing, okay, what is the worst that can happen if I don’t live with her, if I don’t support her financially? Let’s just see, you know. Like will she be able to stand up on her own? Will she be able to take care of herself? Let’s find out. You know. I haven’t ","P1-N400293":"[inaudible – 08:13]. I think I did pay her rent for August. So I guess for September she paid it herself.
THERAPIST: What happened that you feel like you left so badly?
CLIENT: Well you know, they really did actually make allowances for me. Because like all last year I was part-time and that was because they had juggled, they had fought with Mario, the director, you know, and now, and she’s like you have no idea how many battles I fought to make this position ","P1-N400331":"full-time. And I’m like, okay. And I’m like that just really makes me feel like you know this organization…I’ve had it up to here with them, you know. Like I just shut up at every single moment when I felt like screaming, you know.
THERAPIST: Screaming about what?
CLIENT: Well they’re just really disorganized and they’re all about red tape and they’re all about following the right procedure. Just hierarchy and so I just cannot; I’ve worked at places where it’s a lot calmer, a lot smaller and you know, things are more dynamic. There’s ","P1-N400371":"a lot more creativity and not so much sticking to, you know, rules and regulations and all that. So, I mean they pay good money. The work is ridiculously easy. It’s, you know, sending an e-mail. I mean stuff that I’m good at, you know, design work. And like launching e-mails and e-mail campaigns ","P1-N400372":"and e-marketing. I’m good at that. I can do that easily. But what I’m not good at is keeping my mouth shut when people are doing stupid stuff or when people are, you know, bugging me about silly things like protocol, you know. And there’s so much protocol. Like every single e-mail ","P1-N400373":"has to be reviewed by the top most manager, and that’s just like…that just makes me mad. So I just make mistakes…like silly typos and whatever. And then they pick it out and I just make…I’m supposed to feel bad about this but I’m not going to. You know, like my brain ","P1-N400374":"is just not being used here. I can be so much more useful. I can do so much more creative stuff. I’m just coffee basting over here, you know, and making good money while I do it, but I don’t want that.
THERAPIST: How did you…I guess I’m not clear what you said that makes you feel like you burnt those bridges?
CLIENT: Well like cause I think they are thinking that they made a lot of allowances. Like in that meeting they were actually – again, it was just about my schedule – and they wanted; they were letting me work from home on Tuesdays and Fridays. Instead, I said no, I don’t want this. ","P1-N4003F1":"I just don’t want the job. So I don’t know if that has made it clear in your mind. Yeah, so they’re thinking that they’re jumping through hoops and I’m saying that’s not good enough. But I don’t know; I just feel…and it’s also like I just found out ","P1-N4003F2":"that one of my friends from MSU, she was a year after me. She’s doing really well in the sense that she’s got her story published and she’s a writer in residence, and someone calling me in New York, and she’s getting married in December. And I’m just like, I’ve digressed ","P1-N4003F3":"and regressed while she’s made so much progress. She’s a year younger to me, so I feel a little like I haven’t made any progress. And I know I shouldn’t compare because she comes from a lot, like a good family. Like her father is like a big shot in Art History and he’s ","P1-N4003F4":"a curator of a museum and like he’s a big name. So…but you can’t really compare. But certainly I feel like comparing. When it comes to writing I feel like, you know, like her writing was worse than mine and now it’s like improved beyond recognition. It’s really like…it’s ","P1-N4003F5":"really good. I’m happy for her, but I’m a little jealous, you know, and I feel bad for myself that I have [inaudible – 15:01] same.
THERAPIST: Do you feel like you plan for things?
CLIENT: No. I’m a really bad planner. I would well say that.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean and I’m sure there is some thought process that goes on, right, when you make your decisions. But sometimes, I don’t know; like it’s sort of a surprise every time I see you. I don’t understand what went on. Why are you doing this? It’s so confusing. ","P1-N400491":"I guess that’s how I feel. I feel very confused. And so I think that’s why I asked that question. It’s unclear to me sort of what leads you to make the decisions you make; whether they’re proactive decisions or whether they are reactive.
CLIENT: They are probably reactive. Yeah. Yeah, I don’t know the distinction, I guess. Like how I could be; how I could react differently. How I could be proactive about decisions? I don’t know how to do that I guess. Can you explain the difference?
THERAPIST: Well, it seems like the decision to…well; it seems like you decided to take a full-time job and then quit the full-time job in a fairly short period of time; like within a few months. So, yeah, I mean clearly something led you to want to take the full-time job, and then something led ","P1-N4004D1":"you to want to leave it. So those are very different motivations and it happened very quickly.
CLIENT: Yeah. That’s true. That’s what they’re thinking and they’re pissed. Well like I…when they asked me do you want to come back full-time, I said yes. But in my head I was thinking no; no, I want part-time back. But then I didn’t have anything to show for…I ","P1-N400511":"mean I didn’t have like a book contract and I wasn’t expected a book contract in a year. You know, that’s just; yeah, I wasn’t ready for that. But yeah, so I was just not thinking. I just was like, shit, I don’t have a plan for next year except going to school. So I’ll ","P1-N400512":"just say yes right now and I’ll deal with the no later.
THERAPIST: It seems like it’s like other people are relying on you, but you don’t want that responsibility and in a way, you resent it.
CLIENT: I’m not sure what you mean.
THERAPIST: Well like it sounds like you know, they were offering you full-time job. It may not be something that you want. But it sounds like you were…you really didn’t like the way they did things. You thought they were too bureaucratic. You were somewhat resentful of how they did things. ","P1-N400691":"They didn’t feel like they were offering you something. You felt like they were stifling you.
CLIENT: Yeah, that’s true. I didn’t feel like that.
THERAPIST: It sounds like with David, you resented having to do this.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don’t know. I know it’s the wrong approach. But like I don’t know how to think of it in the right way. Alright, we all need to move out, so obviously all three of us should be present to help out. How hard is it to think in that, you know, have that train of thought ","P1-N400711":"and follow through and take the required days off? You know, how hard is it to do that? I don’t know. But I didn’t do it. And then I felt bad. But he was making me feel bad, you know.
THERAPIST: It sounds like, you know, you don’t want these responsibilities. You don’t want your work to have to rely on you. You don’t want the responsibility knowing that they’ve gone the extra mile to help you in the responsibility of participating and moving. You don’t ","P1-N400751":"want these responsibilities. You feel like they’re being imposed on you.
CLIENT: Why is that? I mean, I don’t know. It’s not like…maybe I don’t know why. I don’t know why I feel burdened. You know. Well we all have things to do, right. So they’re not like, they’re not burdens on us. They’re just things to do; they’re ","P1-N400771":"just time commitments. I don’t know why that is. I know that’s the case.
THERAPIST: Are you an David considered together now?
CLIENT: I don’t know, but that is a whole other mess. But again, I’m not in a place where I can so those things. But it’s really because he has a full-time job [inaudible – 28:54] okay to quit. That really makes me cringe as I hear myself say it. I’m sure hoping that I ","P1-N400831":"will not have to ask him for money. But yeah…even if we’re not together, I guess, he’s agreed to help me if I need help. I was kind of hoping I would have like some part-time deal, but oh well.
THERAPIST: In both the cases you said today where you said, “Well I can say this in here,” I guess meaning speaking to the confidentiality and also like maybe no precautions or something. Hopefully you feel that way. That they’re both examples in which you feel like you took something ","P1-N4008B1":"from someone or you’re taking something from someone.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Well, with the job situation, it seemed like you felt some shame that the way you, you know, sort of the timing of the job you were able to get paid full-time when you were away. So it seemed like one of the reasons you said like only within these four walls is because you felt you were saying ","P1-N4008F1":"I took something from someone I shouldn’t have taken.
CLIENT: I did.
THERAPIST: And the same thing with the David. You said well that you were going to take something from him or you want something from him.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And that sort of…those are the two times in which you felt a sense of self-consciousness or guilt or…
CLIENT: Yeah it’s true because in the job thing, I feel like the right thing would have been to say no, I want to be honest with them, but it’s more important to be honest with myself and to allow myself this…I’m a person, you know. Like I have a life. I should…and it’s ","P1-N4009B1":"just as valid as someone else’s life. So why can I not get that in my head and treat myself with respect instead of you know like, pussyfooting around everything and being like, eh, just make it work. I’ll just make…I don’t want to think about it. I mean I’m doing such ","P1-N4009B2":"a shoddy job with everything that concerns myself. Why is that? Yeah, I mean I should have just said no I want something part-time. I’m sorry. And people would appreciate and would love me more for that; for being, for allowing myself, for taking my needs under consideration and being honest. ","P1-N4009B3":"Instead, just for a few thousand dollars, I just said yes. I mean I didn’t know that I was going to quit, actually, to be honest. I didn’t know for sure. So that’s why I kept it. And now I’m thinking back and going, well I guess it was financially a good decision because I got ","P1-N4009B4":"paid for a few months.
THERAPIST: I think you’re angry about a lot of things and I think that the way the anger gets expressed is often in fairly self-destructive ways.
CLIENT: I know.
THERAPIST: Like burning a bridge where you could have some money coming in that could be useful, getting yourself in to a car accident; things like this.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know how to stop this.
THERAPIST: One way I think that would help is to talk about and try to understand better the things that you are really angry about. There’s a way in which when people hold you accountable, you don’t want that. You want to sort of push back.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t want that. I mean I want people to rely on me. I mean that only makes myself feel better about myself, you know. I do care about people. I mean I get described as mean and very kind and very loving. So…it’s not that.
THERAPIST: Did what I say make you feel badly about yourself?
CLIENT: A little, but I know that’s because you want me to be a more positive person and so…
THERAPIST: Well, I want to help you be the kind of person you want to be and achieve the kind of things you want in life, both professionally and romantically. And to do that, I need to help you sort out all the feelings that you have that sabotage those goals. And I think there are a lot of them.
CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like – and I’ll say this and I know what you’ll say.
THERAPIST: You do? You know what I’ll say already before I say it?
CLIENT: Yes. I was going to say if I can just make it as a writer; if I can just have this one thing that I want, then everything will be alright. And you’ll say, well that’s your magical thinking again. You know, that’s what you said last time and it really resonated with me because ","P1-N400B71":"that’s…I am seeing that that’s what I do like.
THERAPIST: What upset you about what they said?
CLIENT: Well, they just…again, I thought that they were holding me back. It was weird, you know, like I’m actually watching myself saying these things. That’s completely ridiculous, but that’s what I was thinking. I was thinking that you know they’re responsible for my ","P1-N400C11":"lack of success and they’re holding me back and they’re just…they have no idea the pain that they’re causing me and you know, it’s like all this bitterness which I’ve kind of dealt with already because I see that…I meant all those required was opening up my ","P1-N400C12":"calendar and seeing that, yes, I can do school work three days of the week and then the rest four days I actually have for my novels. I could still, you know, manage both things. I was just like, okay. I didn’t need to get upset over; I didn’t need to get upset at my professors at all. So ","P1-N400C13":"that was just like…
THERAPIST: But it sounds like that was the feeling in the job too; that they were holding you back. They were creating all these constraints and they’re sort of sapping your creativity.
CLIENT: Yeah, I feel that way and I don’t see that I am being neurotic when I think that way. Because I’m not the only one who thinks that way; it’s a lot of people.
THERAPIST: Yeah, well I would say that in that there’s a sort of level and intention.
CLIENT: In my thinking?
THERAPIST: Yeah, sort of they’re holding you back because if they’re holding you back, they’re sapping you, they’re doing something actively to make things worse for you rather than…they may be offering you something that you don’t want or that you can’t make ","P1-N400CD1":"use of. But that’s different from them doing something against you and it sounds like you were feeling they were doing something against you.
CLIENT: I feel like that for just a little while, but like in connection with certain people and maybe, again, it’s because I’m neurotic or something. But I felt like they really function in that way…I mean they play favorites.
THERAPIST: I mean I guess one of the things that I feel like I can help you with is this anger you feel when you feel these ways towards other people.
CLIENT: Yeah. That would be helpful.
THERAPIST: You feel angry and then the ways in which you try to get something for yourself, you feel guilty; you feel like they’re kind of misleading.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: When I asked you about David and whether you’re together, and then you sort of admitted, you know, that he has full-time job now; that the ways in which you try to get things from other people, you feel very guilty about. You feel like they’re kind of on the sly.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know. Even if I take money from my mom, I feel that way. I feel dirty taking money for a moment. It really; in fact, that was the reason I wanted to break up with him because I thought I’m not sexually attracted to him, you know. So all I can get out of him are expensive ","P1-N400E51":"dinners and that makes me a slut, you know. Not in that way. And I can still think that way. So I feel like the honorable thing would be to break up with him. Now I feel completely…this is happening yet again. I feel like I put myself in like this box. Here’s another restriction and I need ","P1-N400E52":"money and he’s the only one who’s going to offer it. I’m bound to him now. And I got myself in this position because I just quit my job. So…
THERAPIST: I’d like to continue to help you with these things. We’re going to need to stop in a minute and I wanted to know what do you want to do going forward? I know we haven’t met in several weeks. What would you like to do about the treatment?
CLIENT: I will have more time now that I have quit my job. So starting in October, I’m hoping that I’ll be home to go in in the morning. I mean I’ll prefer those slots if you have them available.
THERAPIST: I do. So…but you want to take a few weeks off. I’m not sure what the few weeks are.
CLIENT: Yeah, so the next couple of weeks – are there two or are there three?
THERAPIST: So I guess two more weeks in September.
CLIENT: Okay, so in that case, I mean if you have any time available next week or the week after, maybe I’ll do one session and then like with the insurance…
THERAPIST: Will you have insurance through the school?
CLIENT: Through the school, but I think it won’t begin until November. I don’t know why I’m saying that. Maybe you told me that or maybe I heard at Amherst.
THERAPIST: You should ask them. It should kick in September. I don’t know why; it should kick in in the school year.
CLIENT: If it has, then I’ll definitely find out. I’ll find his out. I’ll work on this on Tuesday.
THERAPIST: Yeah, let me know because then I can bill your insurance and you can get a much smaller copay. As we’ve been talking about, finances are tight for you so you know. I give you a reduced fee, but I appreciate that for a limited budget, even that is a lot, especially if we’re going to try.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean I really do think…do you think that you’d want to commit to twice a week starting in October?
CLIENT: If I can have my insurance kick in, then yes. Otherwise I would probably prefer like once a week or once every two weeks.
THERAPIST: We’ll talk about that. Your insurance should cover…we’ll look in to that more. If you want to ask, you can feel free to e-mail me the information. I can look in to it either way. If you need some help with that.
CLIENT: Sure, thank you.
THERAPIST: So let’s…I have a couple of morning times in the next few weeks. Do you want me to take a look at those? Is that a possibility?
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: I know for the next two weeks I have a Monday, a 10:10. Is that a possibility?
CLIENT: Um, next week?
THERAPIST: I have next Monday at 10:10, and next Tuesday at 10:45.
CLIENT: Yeah, Tuesday, for the next couple of weeks won’t work because I have to go to work and then, to UMass.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: But probably Monday. I think; no, I have meetings on Mondays.
THERAPIST: Do you want to look at late…? What would work for you and I’ll take a look?
CLIENT: In September?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Probably afternoons.
THERAPIST: Afternoon.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Is…? How late? Because I have a three o’clock on Tuesday.
CLIENT: Tuesday won’t work.
THERAPIST: Tuesday won’t work. How late in the afternoon would you need a time?
CLIENT: As late as possible.
THERAPIST: How about 5:30 on Thursday? Will that work?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So, when I…do you want me to e-mail you or do you have a…?
CLIENT: Probably e-mail it right now would work.
THERAPIST: Okay. I do; I know that you had kind of a complicated schedule and the car accident. But I do really hold people to their times because I have such limited times. If I reserve for you…
CLIENT: I’m sorry.
THERAPIST: No, don’t apologize. I don’t want you to apologize, but I do hold people to their times in terms of being…hopefully that you come, but being financially responsible for the times I have to. So we do that when I section it off. So I have you – I just wanted to let you ","P1-N4013F1":"know that. So I have you in for 5:30 next week. And then we can kind of revisit in October what we’ll do. Okay.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And ask, you know, check in with your insurance. If you want me to look in to it, you can send me the information and I will, okay.
CLIENT: Okay, sure.
THERAPIST: So I’ll see you next Thursday.
CLIENT: At 5:30.
THERAPIST: Yeah. In fact, I’ll just e-mail you right now just so you have it.
CLIENT: Yeah. No, I’ll be here.
THERAPIST: Okay, it will be 5:30 next Thursday. Great. Okay, take care.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Take care. Bye bye.
CLIENT: Bye.
