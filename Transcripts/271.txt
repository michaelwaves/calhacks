TITLE: Client "S" Therapy Session Audio Recording, December 05, 2012: Client is having difficulty getting her career started and rejection in her professional life is having an impact on her personal life.
DESCRIPTION: Client is having difficulty getting her career started and rejection in her professional life is having an impact on her personal life.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.
CLIENT: I'm cold.
THERAPIST: I don't understand the connection.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: The connection between your work not getting published right away and Chris saying we should end it. I'm not sure I understand.
CLIENT: Well, it is you know this is when we went for years, where like I get a rejection and then I feel completely and totally like inadequate. And then you know say that out loud and like, you know this is so bad, and I'm not a good girlfriend and this and that. And he was, he's been feeling inadequate ","P1-N400191":"as well. Because he's like, you know you should be with someone who can, I don't know bring you out of your state of depression or bring, or make you basically saying I can't do anything. I cannot connect you with agents like other friends have. Artist boyfriends and they connect them with agents ","P1-N400192":"and editors and Chris cannot do that and he feels inadequate in other aspects as well I guess. (laugh) So he was just like, well, maybe we should just. And he felt (laugh) and I was like wow, you know I've lost you know, him as well as you know just, but. [00:04:31]
THERAPIST: He's this and that. What's this and that?
CLIENT: Well, just like you know, I am underhanded and you're going to get into trouble by doing this you know. Because I thought you know, like the editor would read it and go yuck, you know she's just so desperate and whatever. And you know he would be, he would refuse immediately and you know. But ","P1-N400211":"he was actually very nice. He said you know, yeah, let's chat when you're free and I thank you for your piece, you know, work on it some more and send it back and. [00:06:13]
CLIENT: (Laugh) Oh yeah?
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: About what?
THERAPIST: The professor. There's just -
CLIENT: (Laughing) Yeah.
THERAPIST: Why do you, why do you it seems like this is something you're not happy about.
CLIENT: What?
THERAPIST: The whole situation.
CLIENT: Well yeah. I mean it was a mess.
THERAPIST: Why do you think you're giggling?
CLIENT: I'm feeling like a bitch. (laughing) [00:07:34]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: What I'm just trying to say that I'm trying to quickly (laugh) explain a scenario I guess. (pause) But what I was trying to get at was that I feel a lot of anxiety comes from being with Chris. And I'm not trying to blame him. But it's just that you know he's there and his judgment means so ","P1-N400411":"much that it makes me like second guess myself. [00:08:19]
THERAPIST: What is the weight of their words?
CLIENT: Well, I mean rejection is so like horrific. In my case (laugh) you know I've had so many, it feels like, it's just like ten tigers. I'm carrying it around with me. I wish I could let it go. I wish I could take, carry it just the light weight of my success. Successes, but unfortunately I prefer ","P1-N4004B1":"to carry the weight of my losses. [00:10:10]
THERAPIST: Do you feel that that will help you get your work published?
CLIENT: Well, yeah. I mean I do have that motive. I mean why I mean I'm not going to lie and say, no I don't. But I'm hoping you know, by meeting with him, he'll be, he'll you know, I won't just be a name on the page, I'll be a person. And you know if I can free up some of their time, then they may ","P1-N400511":"have some time to like work with me. Because their knowledge is very specialized and like you know, not even my professor may be able to help me in the way that they can to edit. Because they really know what they're, you know in what forum the piece will look best published. So you know, they yeah. [00:11:56]
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're desperate to have them publish your work.
CLIENT: Yeah! (Laughing) I kind of told people that because the, my colleague said yeah, it's a done deal. They'll publish in the next issue. So I kind of started telling people (laugh) and now I'm like great. How am I going to tell them (laugh) that it's not going to be published, and. [00:12:18]
THERAPIST: What do you imagine it will feel like if it were published?
CLIENT: Great. I mean then my career has finally started (laugh). I've only had like online publications until now. So it would be like print publication would be. And my other colleagues have already started getting published anyways and I'm like anxious to be in their league you know (laugh). So [00:12:48]
THERAPIST: So a kind of recognition?
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, and like I said, start off my career and you know, I've give up so much to pursue this. You know, good jobs and stop living with my mom and this and that, so. I mean this is what I want to do and so. (pause) [00:13:24]
THERAPIST: So you're anticipating that Chris would scold you?
CLIENT: Well he would just be like, Oh, my God, oh, my God, he would you know, beat his head with me (laugh). So, what I don't realize that you know, he's not me. He's a different person. Then the way he may take what I'm doing, can be very, can have you know, adverse effects on our relationship, you ","P1-N400631":"know. (laugh) [00:14:29]
THERAPIST: I'm not sure I understand how you're harming them.
CLIENT: I don't know, I feel, I mean am I not harming them?
THERAPIST: Well, how are you harming? I don't understand how you're harming them?
CLIENT: Looks like harm. I mean he was sad. Chris was sad yesterday. He was so, he was really sad and the look we were going to school together you know, on the train and on the bus. I was like crying and you know he was off to the side. And then you know like, but then soon as we were walking down ","P1-N4006F1":"the hall and as soon as he met some, just this new woman in his department, I couldn't see them, I heard them. But like he was like oh, hi! He was like completely, you know changed his tone and demeanor. And I was like, you know, no wonder you know like, that's the kind of women men like. [00:17:18]
THERAPIST: Do you feel like people are happy all the time?
CLIENT: That's the impression Victor (sp) gives. (laugh)
THERAPIST: Do you believe that? Do you believe that most people are happy all the time?
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: Do you really?
CLIENT: Yeah. (laugh)
THERAPIST: Is Chris happy all the time?
CLIENT: He's too busy to be like oh, what am I feeling. (laughing) You know? But yeah, that is happiness for him you know, completely like submerged in his work. And like too busy to notice what he's feeling. That is, that is his state of contentment. I really wouldn't say happy but content. So yeah, he's [00:18:36]
THERAPIST: Do people never have hard times in their life?
CLIENT: (laugh)
THERAPIST: No, I'm serious. I want to understand how you think about things.
CLIENT: But if they do, they handle it better. They shut the door, their door and like deal with it. You don't see them. But then when they come out they're all, you know all sorted out and ready to mix and mingle and be, and share my you know, vivacity with you. (laugh) [00:19:19]
THERAPIST: Don't you think that couples ever talk about problems?
CLIENT: Well, maybe they do in a way that is more adult like. Well that's what Chris says anyway is that I have a lot of childlike tendencies, so. (sigh) It can be very frustrating to deal with. [00:19:45]
THERAPIST: What would, what is adult like?
CLIENT: When not be such a mess. I mean, I don't know. (pause) I mean the thing isn't just that I feel bad. I feel bad that I feel bad. (laugh) [00:20:14]
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: It's double, it's a double like beating on my head. [00:20:22]
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: I mean I have, and that's what Chris was saying that you know, like he should just not be so worried perhaps. You know, that he is in a relationship with an artist and artists get rejected, so he shouldn't, he shouldn't be, he should get used to that, he said. [00:20:44]
THERAPIST: Can you imagine being with someone who suits you during those times where you're distressed?
CLIENT: I don't know what would suit me. (laugh) I usually do, I usually push people away when that happens. And this is not like a very recent thing. It, I was like this in college as well. I remember this was my goal was well like, I would get a bad grade in calculus and I'd just want to hide. And ","P1-N400A11":"he would be all sweet and try to, you know, pull me out. But I wasn't ready to be out and I would just let that dark period have its, run its course. And then I'd come out. [00:22:19]
THERAPIST: Did it help, did it help just to know he was trying to make you feel better?
CLIENT: I don't know. I pushed people's kindness away so rudely and so like, yeah. I mean angry. (sigh) I really am very, very mad when I hear Chris are trying to be sweet (laugh). I don't know why. (laughing) It makes me feel worse. (laugh) [00:23:02]
THERAPIST: I wasn't yeah, I mean one thing I was questioning is it sounds like when you're distressed you feel like you should take care of it all by yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah. My mom was like that. I think I get it from her. Like she, and this pisses me off a lot that you know, she doesn't even tell me after the whole thing is gone and done or you know even much worse. Or yeah, resolved. But that's just how she is. She says you know, like she has to deal with ","P1-N400AF1":"it herself, and I guess and I wonder if I'm just like that, but. [00:25:55]
THERAPIST: But you felt something was given to you and then it was taken away.
CLIENT: Yeah. (laugh) And I feel like I can do something about it. I can fight. And that's what I felt like doing. (laugh) I mean I feel close in the sense that they like it and they need work, it's just that they, they don't have time right now to work on it. And if I could just change that, you know, ","P1-N400B71":"like if I could do some of their work for them, then they'd have time. (laugh) I don't know. It's thought. It's you know, we'll see. [00:27:57]
THERAPIST: Again, I don't understand why Chris was feeling badly. I mean he knows this about you. Won't mean then, I don't understand that piece.
CLIENT: What piece?
THERAPIST: Why he was feeling bad.
CLIENT: Well first of all he was feeling bad because he, I mean because he's seen me through this like. And he, yeah, because you know, he's like you know, you're so close. And you know, they said one thing now they're going back. And so he felt the disappointment as if it was happening to himself, ","P1-N400C11":"you know. He felt bad. And then he felt that he couldn't do anything about it I guess. He felt helpless. [00:29:34]
THERAPIST: Well, clearly you want to get something out of a relationship because you're in them. You're hoping for something, otherwise you wouldn't bother.
CLIENT: (laughing) Really?
THERAPIST: Well, why else? Are you in relationships because you have nothing better to do?
CLIENT: (laughing) I mean I like, sorry I'm just think of you know being by myself in the apartment. And like being with Chris. I just like the coziness of being with someone you know. Like I like that when you're cooking, it's not just for yourself. It's for you know, two people or more, you know. ","P1-N400CD1":"And you know, I like that you have work to do. I don't like it but, I mean it's there, but then you have work to do, but you also have to make dinner, so you, you know put aside your work and make dinner. But, I don't know. I don't know. (laughing) [00:31:53]
THERAPIST: I'm not sure.
CLIENT: Well you know, that she is I mean, well what do you make of?
THERAPIST: I don't know. I'm not sure where you're I don't know.
CLIENT: I don't know. I just mean, yeah, just that they're comfortable with their body image and whatever. And you know but, they think they're sexy or whatever. But I absolutely cannot do that. You know, I cannot take such photographs of myself. (laugh) You know I cannot, you know. So. [00:35:16]
THERAPIST: So do you feel that relationships between people are superficial?
CLIENT: After Victor, (sp) yeah. (laugh)
THERAPIST: Do you think that superficiality would be gratifying?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What about it?
CLIENT: First of all it would be, probably be such a welcome change (laugh) from the way that I have experienced relationships. And it would be, you know a nice break from the sharing of all the muck, you know. It would be as if the muck is not there for you know, at least those few hours. [00:37:22]
THERAPIST: How?
CLIENT: We're so, a feeling I definitely am so like heavy and weighty so much of the time, that it would be nice to look at the superficial elements (laugh) for, you know. Like the think that attracted me to Chris all those years ago was his gravitas. You know like his political bend and his you know, ","P1-N400EF1":"ambition and his, yeah, wanting to do something very different. That's what attracted me to him. [00:38:05]
THERAPIST: You don't think so? What about Chris? He does?
CLIENT: Yeah, he does.
THERAPIST: And what makes him different?
CLIENT: He's just a much nicer guy than Victor (sp). (laughter) But maybe he's nice because not even good looking. (laughter) [00:39:01]
THERAPIST: How are those related?
CLIENT: Well I'm just being facetious, you know like, those of us who are not good looking have to be, have to compensate for that. But being nice and being caring (laugh) I mean, you know like you just, you know this one girl that you know the brats that are in the room can be cruel and get away with ","P1-N400FF1":"it because (laugh) you know. So. [00:39:35]
THERAPIST: Do you feel confused?
CLIENT: Yeah. (laugh) Again you know, should I be grave or superficial? And they're two extremes. (laugh) And I know that probably the answer is to be in the middle. To have a balance. To have a little bit of both. And I'm trying to get there I guess. [00:41:13]
THERAPIST: Thank you, thank you for pointing that out Victor?
CLIENT: Yes. (laughter) You know, and that, well that's who I am, you know, I'm not, I cannot be. I'm not going to get there anytime soon, if at all, you know. (pause) Yeah. I want to do something different. I want to be successful. I want to work. And that's my high you know. (laugh) My everything. ","P1-N4010F1":"That's my low right now, but. (laugh) I'm not so lonely. But I just want to be happy with the decision to be me, you know? [00:42:59]
THERAPIST: This is a very different place then where you started off the session.
CLIENT: Yeah. (laugh) I'm just tired of being frustrated and being kind of neurotic. (laugh) So it's fun. I'm not fun at all and you know, but it's a challenge. [00:43:26]
THERAPIST: Like you were devastated the last two days.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Doesn't sound fun.
CLIENT: No. I was being sarcastic, but. (sigh) But it's just like being with Chris is so like I take it too hard, I take it too seriously. And he is so awesome, but, I just, I look up to him so much that you know, my neck aches. (laugh) (pause) I mean it's not him, it's just, it's me that I feel inadequate ","P1-N4011B1":"and because I see him as having accomplished so much you know. So. [00:44:26]
THERAPIST: If I think it will?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: The dynamic of how you feel about him and?
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. When does that happen like, when people who have been together for seven years, and you know, they see each other in this way. And then there's reasons for seeing, I mean you know. Being intellectual difference it means two people are their accomplishments, do they ever feel ","P1-N401251":"equal you know? (laugh) [00:45:22]
THERAPIST: Well, I hope to help you think differently about yourself and other people in general. And so will that impact how you see Chris? Probably. In either directions, seeing more of his limitations and feeling that's not for you. Or seeing more of his qualities that you admire and living with ","P1-N401271":"the things that he can offer. It could go either direction.
CLIENT: Yeah, I know. (laughter)
THERAPIST: We need to stop today, okay?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I will see you on Monday.
CLIENT: Okay. Thank you.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: More days, a couple of days.
THERAPIST: Thank you very much.
CLIENT: Oh, more then.
THERAPIST: I'm sorry?
CLIENT: Yeah, there's more. More days than just this.
THERAPIST: Bye.
CLIENT: Bye. [00:46:15]
