DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the therapist's pregnancy and apologized for overstepping any boundaries or asking any questions that were uncomfortable. Client discusses his wish to have a family, but his anxiety and fear that he cannot start one, or does not want to start one, with his wife because of her depression.
THERAPIST: Hi.
CLIENT: So I’ve been fairly anxious this week about a few different things. I’ve been working on the same paper for the last couple of months. It’s sort of been my big paper that I want to talk about in job interviews. So I’ve been trying to finish it before I send out applications. ","P1-N4000D1":"But I both need to send out applications because I need to have a job and also because there is sort of like I’m anxious about where we will be. I can understand that. Uncertainty, I don’t really like. I feel like I’ve been putting her in a position of uncertainty for a while and I ","P1-N4000D2":"understand the concerns there.
THERAPIST: I balked at one?
CLIENT: From over here you balked at it. I’m sensitive to particular things. So, I asked if this was your first pregnancy and you sort of…that was the moment at which you disengaged from directly asking questions and started, I felt like, harvesting more defensively. You were more reluctant ","P1-N400211":"to answer some questions. That is one that I believe that you were more reluctant to answer. I could be wrong in that belief. Recognize that is the premise under which I’m operating here.
THERAPIST: When you say appropriate, how do you mean?
CLIENT: Like take a piece of it or something for myself, which is why it sounds horrible to me.
THERAPIST: How is that related to being challenging or is it separate?
CLIENT: No, no, I mean that’s, in my mind, we have maternity leave because one needs maternity leave after childbirth in order to recover, relate to the child, take care of the child’s needs, all of that. So we have some societal accommodation there. So sort of like it’s not a secret ","P1-N400371":"that it’s hard, I guess, is the other…is how it was related.
THERAPIST: I see. [Pause.]
CLIENT: I think there’s also the sense that like one of the things I’d like to do in my other relationships is like be aware of the things that people are struggling with and sort of offer to talk with them about them; sort of tell them that I understand this is going on. So I think that ","P1-N4003B1":"I’m trying to do that and realize that our relationship is very different from my other ones, but I think that I’m doing that anyway. So I think that’s part of it. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: And was the hope that had I had a miscarriage or had an abortion or something like this – I guess those were the two conditions under which I would be pregnant and not have a child right, I guess those were the only two – that I would say more about that or just that it would ","P1-N400471":"be acknowledged or what would happen?
CLIENT: That’s a good question. [Pause.] Yeah, so when asking questions and thinking about it, I had a desire to tell you that I feel sorry for dismissing that experience and also to tell you that I was sorry for your loss if that were the case. [Pause.] That’s about as far as it went. Like ","P1-N400491":"I don’t [pause]…it’s sort of like I…sort of like if I accidentally step on your foot when I was walking in here, I might say, “Did that hurt?” and then I would apologize for stepping on your foot. Normally I would probably just apologize because I’m sure it ","P1-N400492":"would hurt, but like if I weren’t sure I might ask first. That’s like a crappy metaphor for what I think was going on. I actually want to know, but that’s like…I also recognize that that’s a level of knowledge about you that I have no reason to expect you would want me ","P1-N400493":"to have and I’m actually really okay with that. But it’s this idea that like I have unintentionally stepped on you that led me to ask the actual question. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Rightfully so. Particularly with [inaudible – 20:53]. Some of that was the time constraints and some of that was like having the sense that I’ve asked this question that you don’t want to answer; trying to give you enough other questions that you couldn’t possibly answer ","P1-N400531":"all of the questions so we can both pretend that you’re not avoiding any particular one. My instinct is to keep throwing other questions at you. I have many more, so it’s…
THERAPIST: You’re doing just fine on your own.
CLIENT: Oh, but I’m done. Those are all the things that I traced out to present.
THERAPIST: Clearly you thought about it. I will say with the question about whether I was…I did sort of pause after you asked the question had I been pregnant before. And it wasn’t…it made me think that I didn’t really like that question. And my not liking…but the reason ","P1-N400631":"that I began to be more focused on you is that my liking or not liking a question should not be the reason that I respond to it.
CLIENT: Are you willing to say anything more about what you mean by you didn’t like the question?
THERAPIST: Just, I mean I…it doesn’t really bring up anything negative. But I didn’t like it; it wasn’t like, of the questions you asked, not a question I wanted to answer.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So that’s what I mean by it. Not like I didn’t approve of it, but it was yeah; it was something that I was less, sort of just okay, let’s just answer that too. And then when I thought about that, I thought well my liking doing something doesn’t mean that this is necessarily ","P1-N4006F1":"the most productive, or you know, something like that.
CLIENT: Okay. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: Oh, where did you go?
CLIENT: I’m actually just trying to wrap my head around what you said, like just internalize it. It seems to be slow or something in this specific context. If I’m understanding correctly, your internal response to the question made you question the approach that you had been taking, so you ","P1-N400791":"changed the approach.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Exactly.
CLIENT: Alright. [Pause.] I actually had nothing else…other than I have read one of those books and liked it. So.
THERAPIST: Which one?
CLIENT: Curious Incident – The Dog in the Night-time.
THERAPIST: That’s a good one. That’s a good book. Very quirky.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean there are so much that you’ve said today that, you know, I would take up with you and sort of…well, at least a couple of things are coming to my mind. The one thought I had is when you were describing just a lot of these things. Not all of your questions, but a lot of your ","P1-N400871":"questions were about me; making sure I was okay and\/or like concerns about the challenges or the difficulties; that they have driven like a negative valance. You know like knowing a lot of other pregnant women and how difficult it is and like kind of along that vein. And I was sort of struck by that. [Pause.]
CLIENT: I think I had the sense that one of the ways that people get through life is by sharing their joys and their sorrows with the people and normally, I can…I have like the capacity to carry a lot of things so I can sort of carry other people’s sorrows. It helps. And I like it too. I ","P1-N400891":"like to help people. I think that’s sort of…I think that’s all I have are just thoughts. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: And do you feel that’s somebody that I would want to do to?
CLIENT: No. I think not with me. I feel like it must be a thing that you want to do, but you know, you talk about taking care of yourself and having a good support network. Those imply that you do these things. Yeah. That was a sketchy response, but it covers the whole area.
THERAPIST: Does it make you feel left out in some way?
CLIENT: [Pause]. Almost certainly. Like I don’t have any real sense that you ought to, like, rely on me when I share these things. Phrasing that seems sort of absurd. [Pause.] But I felt like I talked many times about how strange it is for me to be in a relationship where like I share all of these ","P1-N400971":"intimate things and now myself like, you hear, perhaps; occasionally I mentioned in passing the good things in my life. But mostly I talk about the bad things here. So that’s like one way our relationship is skewed. And then another is that like you just don’t talk much about yours.
THERAPIST: That I’m not sure…my other set of thoughts which I’m sure are related somehow, is what you were saying earlier about thinking about in general, perhaps, my pregnancy, bringing even more to the forefront about wanting family or not wanting family, or not even knowing if it’s ","P1-N4009F1":"possible with Tanya. And clearly that’s…thinking about that.
CLIENT: Yes. [Pause.] I feel like I’ve sort of said more or less what I had to say on the subject. I so want to say, yeah, you are hearing me correctly. That is a thing that I’m thinking about and it’s hard. But I guess that’s not a sufficient prompt to talk about it further. ","P1-N400A11":"Is that an okay thing to say?
THERAPIST: Well clearly you have a lot of fears and fantasies about what this means. [Pause.]
CLIENT: I’m sorry; what is the antecedent?
THERAPIST: What, in terms of like…I mean there’s…I sort of understand like. I have some awareness of why you’d be thinking about this; about Tanya in particular. But it seems like there’s a lot more to it than just what you said in terms of how you think about having a ","P1-N400A71":"family or not having a family. So she’s working as a nanny for three small children right now, so like it’s the sense in which I know that she could do some of the tasks of it. I guess several particular anxieties that I have. I think I’ll just list them or try to.
THERAPIST: I can certainly see as much as you’re happy for me that this has…this is tough. This can be tough for me being pregnant to the extent that it, you know, brings up this issue more even though it sounds like it’s on your mind anyway.
CLIENT: You know I actually think that you being pregnant is a good thing. I’m very happy for you and hopeful that things will be good for you and [inaudible – 42:34]. It sounds like it’s given us an opportunity to talk about these things. So thank you for that particular way of phrasing ","P1-N400B71":"it. But I don’t think so. I actually…thank you for indulging me talking about these things while you’re pregnant.
THERAPIST: Indulging sounds so trivial, for a lack of a better term. I’m not doing it to indulge you.
CLIENT: You know that always brings me out this question of why are you here? Why do we do this? Like what…? Yeah.
THERAPIST: That’s certainly a non-trivial question.
CLIENT: [Laughs.] Yeah.
THERAPIST: You’re anxious about what you’re asking or from me on a lot of different levels.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think that’s right.
THERAPIST: Uh huh. [Pause.] Yeah, I think we should certainly continue to talk about because it’s not just about me here.
CLIENT: Yeah, that’s right.
THERAPIST: We do need to stop though, but I’ll see you tomorrow.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay great. Okay take care.
