DESCRIPTION: Client discusses how she felt attending two parties over the weekend. Client recently stopped spending as much time at her boyfriend's place and is feeling more lonely than usual.
THERAPIST: Hi.
CLIENT: How are you?
THERAPIST: Good, thank you.
CLIENT: Did you have good week?
THERAPIST: It was nice, thank you. [00:01:00]
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:02:04) what we-where we left off last time. [laughs]
CLIENT: [sighs]
CLIENT: [It's very cold] (ph).
THERAPIST: I'm sorry?
CLIENT: I said the season is really changing. It's cold in the mornings.
CLIENT: Sorry I'm so quiet. [laughs] I'm thinking about a lot of things. [00:04:00]
THERAPIST: How do you mean?
CLIENT: Well, I don't know. She was thin. I don't know, I just-I have this weird thinking that if I'm eating, it's wrong, but if someone else is eating, it's nourishing and it's right, it's wholesome and it's healthy. [laughs]
THERAPIST: I think that's true.
CLIENT: [laughs] I still feel like-that's what I feel. I just go into these places and I feel like everyone is just out there to attack me. Even simple questions like, "How do you know this person?" about the mother just felt like an attack. It's like, "What the hell are you doing here?" That's what ","P1-N400551":"it felt like. [laughs] It's just so weird; it obviously didn't mean that at all. To me, it's like, "What right do you have to be here? What makes you valid?" It's totally my own interpretation. The whole time, I was just in defense mode and people are attacking. [00:13:00]
THERAPIST: How do you know what their value system is?
CLIENT: Well, they don't share it.
THERAPIST: Right, so how do you know what it is?
CLIENT: No, it pisses me off that they wouldn't want to share it.
THERAPIST: What are they sharing?
CLIENT: Nothing, which is what I don't like.
THERAPIST: What would you want them to share? I don't think I'm following that.
CLIENT: Well, when I say, "I'm doing this," are you just going to keep eating your pudding? You're not going to say anything, like, "Oh, that's brave (ph). Oh, that's interesting. Oh, that's different. Oh, okay, I have no opinion." Something, some reaction. [00:15:00] Are you just senseless right now? ","P1-N400691":"You're just drowning [laughs] your senses in pudding so you can't really process. I don't know, maybe it's-yeah, I don't know.
THERAPIST: It's the lack of response?
CLIENT: I don't know what. I was just pissed. [laughs]
CLIENT: Maybe lack of response. Just the smugness got to me. That makes me very hateful and judgmental. [laughs]
THERAPIST: You felt she was sort of communicating to you that she was better than you?
CLIENT: Well, she had everything and I was stupid (ph) one. [00:16:01] I'm sure that that's not what they meant.
THERAPIST: It's your perception that you're on a lower rung.
CLIENT: Not really. You just said, "Is she better than you?"
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I'm just saying that's fine, she can be. Obviously, she is. [00:17:01] She's working at Yale, so obviously she's making much more money. [laughs] Right now, everyone is making more money. That's fine. It's okay. I can't really do anything about it.
THERAPIST: Why? What do you mean, right now?
CLIENT: Yeah. I sound like a baby complaining. [laughs]
CLIENT: I (inaudible at 00:17:49) feel like I'm in my early 20s again. [laughs] That when my mom would be like, "Let's go do this," "Let's go to that," and (inaudible at 00:17:58) often would be community gatherings such as this. [00:18:01] I'd be all snobby like Chris, like, "I'm not going to that ","P1-N400891":"shit." [laughs] "It's going to be full of settled people" [laughs] "who may be in their 20s or 30s but they certainly look like they're in their late 40s," with their prams and strollers and giant diaper bags. [laughs]
THERAPIST: It sounds like on the one hand you want that, on the other hand...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...you look down on it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I guess I wonder whether you look down at it (ph) because it's something that you want and you feel like you can't have.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I've never heard you express wanting a baby soon.
CLIENT: Yeah, I know. I've just been suppressing it because it's really not going to pan out right now [laughs] because I want to finish my book first. [00:19:02] Then obviously, the guy situation [laughs] is clearly very, very messed up [laughs] right now.
CLIENT: I try. It's not like I don't try. I try to smile. I try to get over my anxieties and hatred and judgment and go and talk to some people [if not everyone] (ph). [00:21:00]
THERAPIST: How do you know they don't know?
CLIENT: Well, I don't know. I don't know.
THERAPIST: Then I don't know how you know.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:22:12) the same. The guy that I'm sort of seeing, he's like, "Oh, yeah, I liked 'Great Expectations.'" I'm like, "Ah, yeah. Dickens is very good." He's like, "Oh! I didn't know Dickens had written those (ph)." Okay.
THERAPIST: Do you feel like people have to know what you know?
CLIENT: No, (inaudible at 00:22:37). People in the arts are always how...everyone nowadays is less-reads less books. I think that's a general thing. I guess that, as a psychologist, your question is more pertinent to my mind.
THERAPIST: Sounds like a competition of value.
CLIENT: Isn't every interaction a competition of value?
THERAPIST: No (ph).
CLIENT: No? [laughs] Maybe not.
THERAPIST: Are we in a competition of value?
CLIENT: I don't know. [laughs] Maybe, maybe not. [00:24:00]
CLIENT: I think about these things sometimes, but I guess that the way I think I can deal with it is just to focus on my work and meet people who do bring me value and limit such interactions. [00:25:10]
THERAPIST: Well, I guess the point I'm making is that you're bringing a set of your own assumptions to these interactions in (ph) assuming that other people are thinking these things.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You have no idea what they're thinking. Maybe they are, I don't know.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: This woman is probably not thinking, "There's my brother," and so forth, "over there. Look how great I am."
CLIENT: Yeah. No, of course not, but the (crosstalk at 00:25:49).
THERAPIST: It feels that way.
CLIENT: It feels that way.
THERAPIST: That's you (ph) standing in the world that you don't have. That's what it feels like. [00:26:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
CLIENT: It just makes me feel destructive. I don't know how long I will (ph) stay this way. I guess that's what we were talking about last time. I would like to play a different role, for a change.
CLIENT: I guess I go through phases in here, also, right? Certain times, I feel more positive. Certain times, [it's all] (ph) negative and destructive. I wonder why, right now, I feel more negative. [laughs] [00:30:02]
THERAPIST: [It's an] (ph) interesting question.
CLIENT: Is it because I started living on my own and away from Chris? [laughs] What's changed? The season is changing, (inaudible at 00:30:21) something else. [laughs]
CLIENT: [sighs] I don't know.
THERAPIST: Maybe you're feeling sad.
CLIENT: But why?
THERAPIST: You're hopefully gaining new things, but you're giving up or letting go other things.
CLIENT: Like what? [00:31:00]
THERAPIST: You're letting go of the feeling of being taken care of by Chris. You're letting go of a certain kind of relationship with Chris.
CLIENT: Yeah. We're growing up.
THERAPIST: What does it feel like?
CLIENT: Yeah. Are these growing-up pains? [laughs] (inaudible at 00:31:22)
CLIENT: Is it necessary to do this?
THERAPIST: To do? What's this?
CLIENT: To grow up, or what I want to do.
THERAPIST: Right. It depends, right. The question is necessary for what? [00:32:00]
CLIENT: Yeah, for me: for writing; for being strong and being my own person. [laughs]
THERAPIST: Growing up is definitely necessary to be your own person, by definition. That's how one becomes one's own person.
CLIENT: I guess earlier, when I felt fused. Now I definitely feel diffused [laughs] like a particle out there. It's just liberating, but it's also, I don't know. You're up there.
CLIENT: It's not like I don't see a balanced picture. I see that. There are single people there. There are people who are-everyone is, or maybe no one is, as strong and smug as I think that they are. [laughs] They're probably insecure and worried about things, yeah. Probably doing jobs they don't really ","P1-N401251":"like as much. [00:35:02] Staying up very late looking after the baby. [laughs] They're also probably weak in many respects, like I am.
THERAPIST: Well, and even if they are very together, that doesn't mean they have everything, but even if they are very together, why does that reflect badly on you? [00:36:02]
CLIENT: Yeah. Why does it? [laughs] Because I'm standing next to them and [laughs] that's why.
CLIENT: [sighs]
CLIENT: Do you think, at some point, I will stop comparing myself or will just my insecurity leads me to do that?
THERAPIST: Well, hopefully we're working on helping you feel more secure.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Looking at the ways in which you almost reject security, like when people are giving you compliments...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...and recognition, that you reject that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You seem to kind of be magnetically pulled toward experiences that make you feel insecure or inferior.
CLIENT: Really (ph)? Like what? [00:38:00]
THERAPIST: I don't mean actually going to places that make you feel insecure and inferior sometimes but just the experiences themselves. It seems like compliments don't sink in the way experiences where you feel someone is looking down on you sink in.
CLIENT: Yeah, that's definitely [laughs] there.
THERAPIST: There's a pull, there, for you.
CLIENT: That means I will get into a trouble a lot.
THERAPIST: What kind of trouble?
CLIENT: Well, like earlier, you said I'm starting to go out with guys who treat me very badly.
THERAPIST: When did I say that?
CLIENT: Yes, you did Victor and the guy in Ohio.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I was saying-well, I didn't say you were starting to...
CLIENT: [laughs]
THERAPIST: ...I was saying at that time, you were attracted to people who aren't treating you well. I'm not sure that's why you were attracted to them...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...but I was also-but I didn't make that comment [of late] (ph). I certainly haven't made that comment at all about this guy you're seeing; (inaudible at 00:39:01) I don't know anything about him.
CLIENT: What if he treats me badly? I'm very (inaudible at 00:39:06) right now. [laughs]
THERAPIST: Do you feel like he would?
CLIENT: I don't know. I don't really know too much about him. (inaudible at 00:39:23) try not to, I guess.
THERAPIST: That came from sort of a place of anxiety. What were you thinking? "What if I get involved with guys who treat me badly?"
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Where is that coming from?
CLIENT: Well, it's just I guess certain words that you use, that I attract trouble. No, not that. You said...
THERAPIST: Yeah, I did not say that.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:39:51), people who put me down.
THERAPIST: I didn't really say that, either. I said that's what you take away from experiences. [00:40:01]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That's actually my point, exactly.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That you experience people putting you down. I don't know if that's what's happening.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I'm sure some people put you down. People put everybody-who can find people who'll put other people down?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But that's your experience, that's what you take away from the interaction.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, so there's that piece. Then there's [laughs] that other, earlier piece, where I did go out with guys a couple guys who didn't treat me well. If we analyze that, maybe it'll come up that I was attracted to them because they weren't very nice to me.
THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:41:19)
CLIENT: (crosstalk at 00:41:20)
THERAPIST: I'm sorry, go ahead.
CLIENT: No, that's it.
THERAPIST: Well, you feel that way about Chris.
CLIENT: What, cold?
THERAPIST: Yeah, that you go into these situations with him and his friends and you feel very much like it's cold and intellectual but not warm and nurturing. You very much felt that way with him.
CLIENT: I'm so confused, because some of those situations can be warm and nurturing. [laughs] This weekend, they were all cooking together. I don't know.
THERAPIST: Well, it could be cooking together, meaning you and Chris? [00:42:00]
CLIENT: No, his friends.
THERAPIST: Chris's friends?
CLIENT: Yeah. People he was staying with in Cambridge. [sighs] I was invited, but I didn't go. [laughs]
THERAPIST: You experience Chris as very judgmental.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I know there are parts of him that you feel are nurturing...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...and he takes care of you, so I know that's not the whole picture.
CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:42:37)
THERAPIST: Some people are more cold and some people are more warm.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Some people can be very embracing and accepting; some people judgmental. People can be a composite.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It depends on the person.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You're feeling differently and you're curious about that, a change of seasons and growing pains and what this means for you and the implications and...
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess the goal's really that you bring out the side of people that makes you feel good and makes them feel good. [00:44:00] Have a productive interaction, because everyone can be cold and warm some more, some less, obviously.
THERAPIST: Well, they inspired it in you, too. It was a two-way street.
CLIENT: Yeah, it was very-they were cold and I was whatever, needy or something (ph) [laughs] whatever. [I don't know] (ph).
THERAPIST: They were like an empty refrigerator.
CLIENT: [laughs] Yeah? I would say they were more like rabid dogs, barking at me. [laughs] Well...
THERAPIST: That's different than refrigerator, for sure-an empty refrigerator (crosstalk at 00:45:01).
CLIENT: An (ph) empty refrigerator's just standing there. These guys were bitchy. They bitched. Victor threw me out of his house. That other guy was just like, "Wah, wah, wah, wah," and judgment all the freaking time. [laughs] They weren't just standing there.
THERAPIST: We're going to need to stop for today. I will see you on Wednesday!
CLIENT: Okay. It's 9:50?
THERAPIST: Yeah, exactly. Okay, take care.
CLIENT: You, too. Have a good day.
THERAPIST: Thank you, you too.
