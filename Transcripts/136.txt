TITLE: Client "JJ" Therapy Session Audio Recording, April 30, 2013: Clients discuss their major communication issue and how it is having a detrimental effect on their relationship.
DESCRIPTION: Clients discuss their major communication issue and how it is having a detrimental effect on their relationship.
THERAPIST: Are you okay?
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:01:07)
THERAPIST: Yeah, well, clearly there's some whole meta-messages going on that I (chuckling)...
THERAPIST: Let me slow this down. Let me try and understand (chuckling) what's going on for each of you. So what... in what Steve said, what did you feel he was communicating? What did you hear?
THERAPIST: And so what did...? What was there... what was the implication? What did you feel like he was...? What was the implication of it?
THERAPIST: So were you...? This isn't... because... yeah, there's a lot of... there's something going on here about what you feel you guys are saying to each other. Did you say...? Were... do you feel discouraged at all in that you guys... that things aren't happening more sort of naturally or...? [0:03:00]
THERAPIST: What...? Huh, okay.
THERAPIST: Yeah, mm-hmm. Clearly.
THERAPIST: Because I feel like you have to put effort into fixing things, not just it happening. And I don't see that (sniffing).
THERAPIST: Well, I want to get back to what's going on right now between the two of you? [0:04:56] But I will say I've heard from both of you feeling like things have gotten better. I'm not saying that everything's great, but I've definitely heard that from both of you. So something has shifted this ","P1-N400791":"morning or today or over the week that's making you feel differently, which is fine. I want to talk about how you're feeling. But it does feel different. Especially you guys came in here last week, said... both of you said things feel a lot better. So something got lost. What do you think happened? (Pause)
THERAPIST: You were getting upset there talking about this. What's up...?
THERAPIST: Do you feel that Steve is bringing you here, saying that you're the problem?
THERAPIST: Okay.
THERAPIST: Well, how do you mean?
THERAPIST: Yeah, you both are very frustrated. So we have to figure out a way in which you can be frustrated and sometimes frustrated at the same time without making it worse for both of you.
THERAPIST: So it sounds... one of the things that you're frustrated by, Steve, is that you don't feel Marlene is giving you the benefit of the doubt.
THERAPIST: Not giving you the benefit of the doubt. No?
THERAPIST: So you feel like she's putting you down.
THERAPIST: And you're...
THERAPIST: What is that...? What do you feel she's...? I can't really see. What do you feel like Marlene is conveying in that look? What is she sort of communicating to you in that look? [0:12:00]
THERAPIST: To your mind it clearly means something bad. It's not something (inaudible at 0:12:12).
THERAPIST: That's to mess up? She's waiting for you to mess up?
THERAPIST: Did you feel, Marlene, when Steve said what he said that he doesn't care? Is that how you heard what he said?
THERAPIST: What did you hear? [0:13:00] (Pause)
THERAPIST: Well, you... it sounds like you both feel that way...
THERAPIST: That you guys are each coming into it with an attitude. And it's like a lose-lose situation. You're both feeling that way, it seems like.
THERAPIST: And what is that way? What is that way?
THERAPIST: In theory that you were going to try harder?
THERAPIST: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. I have to say, Marlene's try...
THERAPIST: I mean, that's sort of giving her a ding for past behavior. I'm not... I don't want to be hard on you, and I know you're feeling like... I don't want either of you to feel like you're under attack or on the defensive. But, if Marlene's doing something differently that she should have done ","P1-N401731":"it before, there's not much she can do about before. But she can do something about now. [0:21:59]
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you were saying that when you were feeling more defensive. And when I asked you about it you were like, I recognize that Marlene's trying. This reminds me of the first session you guys came in when you were just, like, both crying the whole time. And I feel like I'm attending ","P1-N401811":"a funeral, it's like something really... and I... people's emotions are real, so when people are really upset I believe there's something to be upset about.
THERAPIST: And so there's something that's deeply upsetting you guys. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Yeah, and it's a problem in part because I think you're talking about two different things there (crosstalk).
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like... right, because where Steve was going with this, it sounded like you... that you felt Steve was saying, look, I need... like, somehow that you were excluded. Like, he needs time for himself but not for the two of you, that somehow you're being excluded from something.
THERAPIST: What...? Let me...
THERAPIST: No, no, no, no, no...
THERAPIST: I will... I'm going to help you guys. Let's not... I don't want to do the never mind. I mind, and I want to help you guys talk about this more. So what do you... when you say time by yourself, what time are you... would you life more of or differently?
THERAPIST: How?
THERAPIST: Well, then I want to stop and ask each of you what you mean on (inaudible at 0:30:05). So how... are there particular things that Marlene does that makes you feel like you don't ... is it what she says or what she does that makes you feel you don't have that freedom?
THERAPIST: I think you guys are talking about something more beyond sort of practical and hours in the day. You're talking about a feeling. And when you're talking about feelings, you're talking about the feeling, it might be tied to things that are going on in the day... [0:31:57]
THERAPIST: Well, let me just ask, so, I mean...
THERAPIST: Okay, so if you... so if Marlene's... I'm not saying the validity of this at all (chuckling), but if Marlene's calling you that often, say she is, what upsets you about that? [0:35:01] What is... what's hurting you? It's not like you're pissed off. You're hurt. What is hurting you? (Pause)
THERAPIST: Look, your relationship is deeply important to both of you. But the way you talk about these particular issues, I feel like there's so much at stake, far beyond I understand right now. Like, so much is at stake in each of these actions.
THERAPIST: So what would you've liked Marlene to say in this particular moment? What would have felt good? [0:36:59]
THERAPIST: Okay.
THERAPIST: Well, I have a couple of thoughts. One is, I can see how this particular issue is... really is like...
THERAPIST: Well, works against you because you're saying, Steve, that you want sort of the freedom and flexibility and not feeling like there's a particular set of expectations that you have to meet. And you, Marlene, feel like Steve isn't making the effort (chuckling) to meet your expectations about ","P1-N402351":"the relationship and what you want from him in a lot of different ways. So you're pushing against each other very strongly?
THERAPIST: Okay, a couple thoughts. Where to start (chuckling)? Do you feel that you each understand what the other person is saying? I don't... you don't have to agree with it, but like that, Steve, Marlene's saying that she feels rejected and excluded...
THERAPIST: She wants you to come... let's say you have to agree with it. And then Steve is saying that he doesn't feel that he can be himself, that he has to be what you want him to be.
THERAPIST: Well, but it's how... okay, I'm not asking you to assess the validity. I'm simply saying this is how each of you feels.
THERAPIST: Well, why not? What's your theory as to why he would...?
THERAPIST: I understand, but I think you both do that. I mean, I do think you both do that.
THERAPIST: One thing... I don't want to move away from what you're talking about, but one thing I'm struck... I mean, you... when I made comments today, you were like, well, it's always like this. You both said that. But I've seen you guys in here, and it's not always like this every session. It seems ","P1-N402531":"like sometimes you guys are doing a lot better than other times, like, dramatically different. Last week was a dramatically different session. So I'm not sure what happens that things really feel like they fall apart.
THERAPIST: And you feel like he was trying before but not this past week?
THERAPIST: And what did he do differently?
THERAPIST: Well, if you were different this week, say you were very different, it sounds like you feel like you go to the worst-case scenario. [0:42:58] Like, maybe it's an off week, but last week was great. So hopefully next week will be great. I'm not saying you should think that way, but that's not ","P1-N402611":"what comes to your mind.
THERAPIST: Each of you when you're feeling very hurt feels like the other person is doing something to you that's negative. I think you're both doing things because you don't know what else to do, and you're feeling like, I'm going to do the one thing I know how to do. But you each interpret the other ","P1-N402651":"person's behavior as you're trying to... the other person's trying to hurt you or make things difficult and so forth. I don't think that's what you're doing with each other. As you were saying, Marlene, you don't know what else to do. What you do might antagonize Steve, or he may feel antagonized by ","P1-N402652":"it. But that's not your intent. You do not know what else to do. (Pause)
THERAPIST: And you're reading pretty negative emotion... negative motivations that make it very difficult to start anywhere. [0:44:55]
THERAPIST: But he's not trying to tell you because he doesn't like you or he... he may be frustrated with you, but I think that this... I mean, what... see, I... well, it's interesting because you started going somewhere with that, Steve, in terms of a way in which you manage how you feel. Now, again, ","P1-N4026D1":"I'm not saying therefore he should be left alone. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying it's in a different context than it feels to you. And this is both ways, it's in a different context. It's not... you're interpreting each other's being against you. What Marlene isn't trying...
THERAPIST: Marlene isn't trying to go against you. She's trying to get you to come toward her, and she doesn't know how to do it. And so you feel like she's riding you, and I'm not saying whether she is or isn't. But she doesn't know what else to do.
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like she hasn't asked you anything about Portland so far. So she needs some credit for that.
THERAPIST: You guys have got to get... Steve may not... may feel ambivalent about being here, but he comes every week. And maybe Marlene's had a quote, unquote, bad track record in the past, whatever that means, but she's trying. And she's making a very concerted effort to do things differently. I can't ","P1-N402791":"stress enough that ultimately it's up to you guys to decide what you want to do with this relationship. It's not me to tell you what to do at these... this is your choice, and it's your life. But I can... I would like to help you sort of see that you're doing... you are... you actually each are trying. ","P1-N402792":"Showing up is trying. It may not be enough, it may not feel like enough, it may not be enough. But it's something. [0:46:59] And, if you guys are just going to sort of go back and say, see, you see, you see, you see, it doesn't get you anywhere.
THERAPIST: Does it feel like that that happens every week?
THERAPIST: Well, I actually both... we're going to need to stop. I know this is a really tough place. But you've both... I... if you could carry with you, I mean, really hold on to the fact that neither of you are trying to hurt each other... Marlene isn't trying to hurt you.
THERAPIST: Steve isn't trying... Steve is really not trying to hurt you. He does not know what else to do right now, that you're doing what you know how to do, which isn't working. [0:47:59] But that's what you're doing because you don't know what else to do right now.
THERAPIST: And I really would... if you guys could hold on to that, I think that would be great because I think even that will make you feel a little bit calmer, not entirely. But the other thing I want to say... I mean, you guys are clearly both very, very stressed out. And I think that that's making ","P1-N402911":"things very hard, too. And, I mean, you have a lot of other feelings besides stress, but you're both really stressed out. And I'd like to talk to you guys about that, too, how you feel and also just practically, maybe what the two of you can do about that. We do need to stop. I could do this... if this ","P1-N402912":"time works for you, I have 11:15. Would that work for you? You said that morning is better.
THERAPIST: Is this a good time? Okay. I will... I'll see you next week then, 11:15.
THERAPIST: Okay.
