DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the frustration and anger she felt towards her mother during a recent family visit. Client is worried that other people judge her because she's not engaged or married to her boyfriend, and because she has put on weight.
THERAPIST: Hi!
CLIENT: Hi.
THERAPIST: How are you?
CLIENT: Good.
THERAPIST: Did you by any chance get anything from the insurance?
CLIENT: No. I don't think so. I sent them both things. Did they send you anything?
THERAPIST: No.
THERAPIST: You can also send me your member ID and then I could follow up with them too. I'm sure they send it with like three weeks so it's okay.
CLIENT: Oh, not good. I have it I got something from them but I think it was for stuff at Brown. I don't think I did get something from them though and it was like I should double check what it was because I thought maybe it was stuff for Brown but it said, 'here's how much you will be billed,' ","P1-N4001D1":"or something. So I'll follow up with them and see.
THERAPIST: Okay, that would be great. Thanks.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Once it gets started it usually keeps going.
CLIENT: Okay, we'll figure it out. So I was in Pennsylvania for like the past week with my family and so that was the usual it was the usual sort of frustrations with them because I'm really aware of their behavior now and I'm almost like intolerant to being around them though which is an issue because ","P1-N400251":"I get so angry and frustrated because my mom does stuff like she just sort of would change plans at the last minute and my boyfriend and I couldn't go along with that because we were seeing his family, too, and she was like making me feel guilty about that when it wasn't my fault. And I knew what she ","P1-N400252":"was doing and I was really upset about it and I just suddenly, I can't even deal with her and I had my boyfriend talk to her about making the plans because it was I was so frustrated that I almost just couldn't even like have a conversation with her so I mean, it's good in the sense that I'm so aware ","P1-N400253":"of everything that's going on now but I have a really hard time dealing with the anger that comes with it controlling the anger because the only time that I really have like outbursts I feel like anger, frustration that I can't control are more when I'm on the phone with my mom or when I'm dealing ","P1-N400254":"with her. And (unclear) that I had a lot of issues with like anger but it was anger due to frustration that I couldn't control but it was always due to interactions with her. [00:03:11]
THERAPIST: How do you feel that you're not doing things on your own?
CLIENT: I feel like I am but parts of it are like sometimes if I get frustrated with my parents or something, my boyfriend's there to help me work through it but the main issue if think too, is financially because he owns our house and while I'm in school is paying for all this stuff and so I think ","P1-N4002D1":"for me it's actually hard to deal with the fact that I'm happy I'm going back to school, but to deal with the feeling like I don't have independence in that area and so my parents keep offering to give me money and I don't want them to so I keep saying no because I don't want to have that at all. And ","P1-N4002D2":"then I don't want any ties like that to them but I also don't want to feel like I can't do things on my own, too. And it's not just and I don't think it's just that, I think it's also like having the person to or the people to praise you or because I think sometimes because my parents I've distanced ","P1-N4002D3":"myself from them about telling them sort of things that now I might be relying on my boyfriend too much to get all of the praise that I want and that's not necessarily what like that's not the kind of relationship that I want to have because I don't want to look to him for the same stuff that I was ","P1-N4002D4":"looking to my parents for. I mean, it's fine for him to say different words of praise I guess, but I don't want to need that or rely on him for that. I just want to not need it from anybody I guess because I'm a little bit afraid that as I don't want to separate or break away from certain reliance on ","P1-N4002D5":"my parents to feel good, I guess. I don't want to then shift or move that onto him. I want a relationship to not have that and have it stay the way it is. I'm a little bit afraid that I'm going to do that, to shift from reliance and attachment to them to changing the dynamic of my relationship with him. [00:12:14]
THERAPIST: What would that look like, that (unclear)?
CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know. I've just seen a little bit that I will tell him sometimes about how I did on a test or something and I need praise or, I don't know, or I'll ask him how to fix stuff or call him for advice or I'm just which I think is fine, but like a lot of is stuff that I would ","P1-N400311":"have called my dad or my parents for previously, and I mean that is part of like a relationship but I just worried about like shifting the roles a little bit. I don't think I'm doing it too much but like also this weekend when I was frustrated I don't know if I like can you just go deal with my mom ","P1-N400312":"and talk to her because I can't. That's me not being able to deal with my own situation and asking him to save the day play that role so I'm afraid that I'm going to rely on him too much in a way that I relied on my parents too much a little bit.
THERAPIST: And you're frustrated with what they say?
CLIENT: Yeah, because I think it's with what they say because I mean it's sort of like my mom twists everything so that if you don't do what she wants you do she gets upset with you or we were eating breakfast one morning and my mom said, 'can you come in tonight and room with me?' And I went in and ","P1-N4003B1":"she started taking shirts out of our closet that she had bought and trying to put them over my head. And I was like, 'what are you doing?' And she was like, 'well, this is a drape-y and I think it's a good color and I think it's going to look really good on you and I'm trying' and I was like, 'no, ","P1-N4003B2":"I was eating breakfast. I don't want to try these shirts on that are drape-y so they'll look' her actions were so obviously odd and obviously I knew or felt that in saying they were drape-y she was commenting on my weight. There were like all kinds of things in there and I was like angered though ","P1-N4003B3":"that she was acting that way.
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: Because I feel like I shouldn't be getting so angry or being like I feel like I should be able to control my anger or frustrations and I feel like I should be able to be confident enough in myself that whatever they say to me is not going to affect my self-esteem and body image. But I had ","P1-N400491":"stopped weighing myself because I thought that might be good to do for a little while but then when I was at their house and they were saying all this stuff to me and then I weighed myself and obviously it was after Thanksgiving so I weighed more and then I got really upset about it and that set off ","P1-N400492":"a whole spiral of thinking really, feeling really negatively about myself. It's like triggering all these different things but I want to be able to it's more of that wanting to be doing it on my own. I want to be able to feel as though good about myself and easily to have a high enough self-esteem ","P1-N400493":"and self-image that whatever they say and whatever they do isn't going to have such a negative effect on me. But that may be hard to achieve but I want to achieve that and I also want to be able to control my emotions enough that I can just walk away for a bit and just have a calm conversation with ","P1-N400494":"my mom but there are so many things that she says that trigger me that it's really difficult for me to have one of those.
THERAPIST: It sounds very painful.
CLIENT: Yeah it's basically when I'm with them it's like, and it's worse with my mom, but it's this weekend of like really painful interactions and emotions and then y when I'm home I'm trying to think through and process everything and I think in doing that I can get down and really upset and then ","P1-N4004D1":"like think all these people are like at this new stage in their life and I'm not and get into all this kind of thinking.
THERAPIST: How do you go from thinking about your parents and your family to thinking about that?
CLIENT: I mean I think part of it was like more people I know got engaged this weekend. But I think that I feel like if I'm married it's going to make my parents think of me in a different way and it's going to make them see my relationship in a different way because I think that they still think they ","P1-N400511":"can swoop in and save the day or like I had my boyfriend as my beneficiary on my 401k and my dad had me take him off because you're not married and you shouldn't have put him so there's like -
THERAPIST: How did he have you take him off?
CLIENT: Well he told me to and I listened to him. (Laughing) So, but like he keeps saying my parents say to me like, 'you're not married. He's stringing you along.'
THERAPIST: Why do you still listen to your dad?
CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know why like they're able to get through. Like they really got through for some reason and then I think because I've always listened to them that it's just sort of like I think that you're just supposed to listen to what your parents say. And that's still that (unclear) ","P1-N400591":"me feeling like in limbo where when they're saying stuff to me like 'if something happens to you don't have any legal obligation to your house. You don't have any legal obligation to anything you'll be left with nothing.' And then they'll tell me a story about someone they know that that happened ","P1-N400592":"to somehow. They say all this stuff about my relationship because we're not married so I think a lot about what they've said is still there in the back of my mind in making me feel like, 'oh no, what if?' So I'll be perfectly content and fine and then it's just being around them and feeling like I just ","P1-N400593":"need to get married so that they will approve of my relationship and then they will see me as separate from them and they won't try to do all this stuff for me and they will I see it like saving me from them, almost like that's the thing is I think that. So I almost feel very juvenile when I'm around ","P1-N400594":"them and like I'm still a little kid and I feel like if I'm married and at a life stage like everybody else's then I won't be juvenile anymore. I won't have to listen to them. It's my way out from them basically. So I think that's why I go from thinking through stuff with them to I think it's triggered ","P1-N400595":"by seeing getting a message that so and so got engaged or whatever. And then it's like well they're all in this next stage and they're able to get away or whatever and I am not there and I still like that's where I think the money thing comes in my dad's always telling me all this stuff and so ","P1-N400596":"I feel like it's still making me feel like tied to them like I still need them for something.
THERAPIST: Do you feel like you're worried about feeling alone? Like you either need to be tied to your parents or a fianc� or a husband or otherwise you'll just be by yourself?
CLIENT: I mean I think that's a little bit of it but I think it's more I mean I don't feel alone now. I feel like I have James and I feel like I don't see the dynamic in our relationship is the same as what it would be if we are married. And normally when I'm not around these like outside influences ","P1-N4005D1":"I just feel like really content and really happy with it and I feel like it's really good and then it's when I feel like people knock my relationship down that I feel upset about it. Because I feel like a lot of it is my parents and I'm really trying we're just going for a night to New Jersey again ","P1-N4005D2":"this weekend and I'm going to see Philip's son and family whom I have been avoiding for a long time because the last time I saw them they buzzed me about not being engaged and saying that I needed to give him an ultimatum and this was a couple of years ago and then I've also gained a lot of weight since ","P1-N4005D3":"the last time I saw them and I'm petrified of them talking about me and passing judgment on me. But I want to be there for my grandfather so I'm sort of torn between these things but they will make comments about us not being married and our relationship and then my aunt was like her now husband for ","P1-N4005D4":"like 15 years and then they married and people were talking about her all the time, in our family, and so it's like I know they're saying the same stuff about me because they've said it to me too.
THERAPIST: That it's a guarantee for anything.
CLIENT: No. And it's really just my family bugging me about it so a lot of the way I feel is torn between what I want to do which I want to be with James and that I know. And like, yeah, we could get married in a courthouse or something and I think when I'm removed from my family and everything my ","P1-N400631":"view is very different than when I'm around them. Because when I'm around them they say like you have to have a big wedding and you have to do all this stuff and you have to be married and you have to and so then I start thinking that that's what I want like it's hard for even me to even figure ","P1-N400632":"out what I want anymore and what's coming from my own thoughts or what's coming from my family and the stuff that they're saying to me. [00:39:09]
THERAPIST: Well here's a thought. I mean, so maybe as painful as it is it's almost "easier" to take in these messages than to think there's really something really disturbing about these people.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like the way you got very tearful when you were describing this pretty bizarre interaction when your mother's trying to put shirts on you and there's something wrong here. There's something really disturbing.
CLIENT: Um hmm. I think I felt guilty feeling that way. And like I still feel like they did so much for me and I think I feel bad putting them down. Like I even felt badly like saying like what they do was weird but it is. I mean so I think that's like a defense I don't want to think of them in that ","P1-N4006B1":"way because I don't think that's the right way to think or the right thing to do but I know that what they're doing is bizarre the way they act is bizarre and erratic and I think I just sort of they've always been the people in my life that I had looked to for advice or to ask for help or to look ","P1-N4006B2":"to for what to do so I feel really guilty like discounting that by thinking that they're crazy or not. I feel really bad feeling that way and I also feel, I mean, I think I've come a long way with that but it's taken me a long time to realize that the way they behave is erratic and strange and I don't ","P1-N4006B3":"want to behave that way. As my boyfriend pointed out to me initially I used to get mad at him and I don't do that anymore because I really acknowledge the way that they act but it's taken me a long time to get there because I feel really badly about the way I feel towards them because I think that's ","P1-N4006B4":"wrong. Even though I (unclear) it's hard to deal with feeling that way towards your parents because I feel on the opposite side they did do they have done so much for me. [00:42:00]
THERAPIST: A feeling of sentiment and attachment.
CLIENT: Yes. There's like memories, sentiment and attachment so I still feel like oh they're older, and they've been through more so I should really listen to what they're saying to me, like these are words of wisdom even though it's really more that they are sort of a lot of it is their old way of ","P1-N400711":"thinking and not being able to accept things that are different. And their culture of judgment and gossip and stuff and I don't know if it's a New Jersey thing or just how they are. So it's hard to be around them and filter out what they're saying because it still really gets to me. So I feel like this ","P1-N400712":"weekend will be hard for me but for only the party on Sunday so we're only going for a little bit because we have to leave so I think that will be good so then I don't have to be there for that long but I almost felt like I wanted to go shopping and get something that made me look thinner or try to ","P1-N400713":"like I'm so obsessed over them seeing my weight and talking about it that I feel like I won't enjoy being there because I'm so -
THERAPIST: Anxious.
CLIENT: Yeah, nervous and anxious about it. I know when I've lost weight they've said something about it so they're probably not going to say anything to me about gaining weight but I know they're going to make comments about it and I just I don't like that feeling.
THERAPIST: Over (unclear).
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Felicity (sp?), we're going to need to stop today, okay.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So I will see you next week.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And good luck this weekend.
CLIENT: Thank you. (inaudible)
THERAPIST: Take care.
CLIENT: Thanks.
THERAPIST: Okay, good-bye.
CLIENT: Oh and do they e-mail (unclear)?
THERAPIST: I don't think they do e-mail.
CLIENT: You have to call.
THERAPIST: I think you have to call.
CLIENT: Okay,
THERAPIST: If you have any problems just you can send me your ID number and I can just -
THERAPIST: Okay, take care, bye-bye.
