THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in. (PAUSE)
CLIENT: It’s been a little bit of a (inaudible at 00:03:53) and so sort of fell back into work which is... (PAUSE) (inaudible at 00:04:09) catching up on a backlog of marketing. [00:04:11]
THERAPIST: Well, it is curious that the boys... I mean, you’re talking about sort of blaming yourself for that. But it does seem curious, maybe understandable, that the boys in Karl’s family fare better than the girls or girl. Does he have another sister? [00:35:07]
CLIENT: No. Just Laura. (PAUSE) Yeah. You know, when I think about it... Well, let’s see. She is the only girl and... (PAUSE) I think she has been singled out.

CLIENT: That’s on Tuesday?

CLIENT: Yes. Twelve o’clock is...
THERAPIST: Does it work?
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: As long as it’s not inconvenient for you.
CLIENT: It’s fine. I think it might even been a little bit easier for Karl who has a meeting in the afternoon.
THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah. Sometimes I know you prefer the earlier times anyway. So I figured I’d ask. Okay very good.
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: So I’ll see you on the 29th on Tuesday at twelve. Okay great. Take care. (PAUSE)
