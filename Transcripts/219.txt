DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the trapped feelings she has when she spends too much time with one man she is dating. Client discusses her thoughts on driving and cross-country travel.
THERAPIST: Hi! Come on in!
CLIENT: Trying to think... think of what to say. (chuckles) (pause) Yesterday was, I guess like, a weird thing... not weird. It was like, a little unusual. As soon as I got to school like, a couple of my classmates were like, upset, were crying and so (chuckles). We spent like half the class time like, ","P1-N4000F1":"talking with one of them (chuckles).
THERAPIST: What were they crying for then?
CLIENT: Oh, just this one girl was just... One of our teachers is kind of... I guess he can come across as abrasive or aggressive. He cares a lot, he’s, like, he’s coming, this concern comes from a good place, but he pushes people like, to think harder, to be tougher. I guess that kind of ","P1-N400131":"rubs some people the wrong way. So she was kind of... she’s been very sensitive all semester long, and I’ve seen her kind of... there is a cloud over her and like... And yesterday she was just crying, so (chuckles)... [00:04:16]
THERAPIST: That they want to feel alone and insecure?
CLIENT: (chuckles) Yes.
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: No?
THERAPIST: I don’t know. It can happen, but I don’t think that’s why people want to be alone (client affirms), the main reason.
CLIENT: What is it, then? Why do they want to be alone?
THERAPIST: They like their own company, they want their own company. [00:08:25]
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It could be, it could go in the other direction. I mean, they might come up, come out of it with positive things, at the end of that. Or they could also sometimes come out with negative things, such as... I’m scared! I need some comfort! You know? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I’m not saying it’s not possible, but I don’t think that’s the motivation, so that they feel scared and then come out of it. (client affirms) What do you think you feel scared of?
CLIENT: Oh, when?
THERAPIST: Like, when you feel, when you’re alone and then you start to feel scared?
CLIENT: Now it’s mostly, now it’s mostly anxieties about writing and my mother and just general worries. Like scared of the future and all those things, not, I don’t know... [00:09:29]
THERAPIST: I’m having a hard time understanding you (inaudible), I think in part, because I’m having a hard time hearing you.
CLIENT: Oh. I think... Is it the fan, or...?
THERAPIST: You, I can turn this off. Maybe that will help.
CLIENT: I think that makes a difference. (therapist affirms) I usually, I just have like, a small voice and sometimes it gets really small. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: It does, sometimes get really small. (client affirms) (pause) What do you think makes it get small?
CLIENT: I guess when I don’t really know what I’m... talking about. (chuckles) So... But I’ll try, I’ll try! I’ll try to be, I’ll try to project, I’ll try to... feel powerful, I don’t know. (chuckles) Or just humor myself. If it actually, the power doesn’t ","P1-N400451":"come like, if I like, just take it lightly. (pause)
THERAPIST: It depresses you in what way?
CLIENT: I don’t know. I think I just have like, associations from my first few years in the U.S. Like, you know, my dad and... yeah. I don’t want to experience that. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: How are road trips connected to that?
CLIENT: I don’t know.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: But I just... get depressed. Even like, on a bus to Ohio, I, you know like, the four hours of... road is not... I don’t like it. (therapist responds) (sighs) I try to read or sleep, but, yeah. So... It just reminds me of like, being in, you know like, back in Virginia and like... certain... ","P1-N400551":"nights of... a lot of nights, I guess, when I was I guess... going to visit my first boyfriend, or coming home from like... I had an internship in Tennessee, so I would drive through Tennessee and Virginia quite often, you know. And then like, the road signs that advertise whatever it is like, topless ","P1-N400552":"bars or whatever and like, my association with like, my dad seeking all these places. I just feel like, vulnerable and miserable about those, that whole, those years. Because I was, you know, completely not in control, you know. Yeah. (chuckles) [00:17:05]
THERAPIST: I don’t have a particular association.
CLIENT: What do you think of, when you’re driving? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Depends on where in the country.
CLIENT: I don’t know. Just... Pittsburgh? (chuckles) I don’t know!
THERAPIST: Strip malls.
CLIENT: Yeah. That doesn’t depress you?
THERAPIST: Do you think that American highways depress most people? (client affirms) I see. There is...
CLIENT: Shouldn’t they?
THERAPIST: What about them?
CLIENT: Because they’re monotonous and there is like, everything looks the same and, you know... [00:19:14]
THERAPIST: Hmm. No matter where you are in the country? You’re driving through the desert, it looks like Pittsburgh?
CLIENT: (chuckles) Okay, so I did, I have had some not-so-bad driving experiences like, when I was in Texas for like, a few days with my mom. Yeah, that was fun. But I was in control, you know. Like, I was, we drove it in the same amount (ph) like, from... even south of Albuquerque all the way to Houston, ","P1-N400731":"you know. We drove that distance and... that was fun, you know. Fun, as in, I don’t know like... as fun as things can be when my mom would like... Not much conversation but, you know... still okay. (chuckles) And it was pretty, too. The landscape kept changing. Yeah. [00:20:24]
THERAPIST: Triggers...
CLIENT: That... my feeling kind of trapped and... powerless. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well, let’s talk about that. What do you think?
CLIENT: (pause) I don’t know. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: It sounds like you felt trapped on Sunday, with Nelson.
CLIENT: Yeah. I’m trying to understand what happened with him. I don’t know. But all I can figure out is that I didn’t get my “alone time,” so... but then, what does that mean, you know? What does “alone time” do to me, you know? I’m like, okay, it can ","P1-N4008D1":"one of two things. One is to fill me with like, strength and like... you know, I can... I feel refreshed, and I feel like I know who I am, and... or it can make me feel insecure and like... I’m needing comfort, I’m needing safety or companionship, stimulation. So... [00:27:40]
THERAPIST: I think boredom can mean a lot of different things.
CLIENT: Yeah? Like what?
THERAPIST: I don’t know; what are your thoughts?
CLIENT: I don’t know. Like, lack of stimulation?
THERAPIST: You said “a profound psychological condition.”
CLIENT: (chuckles) No, I just wondered if like, as a student, you studied (chuckles) that.
THERAPIST: Do you feel like I’m too quiet today? [00:29:33]
CLIENT: No. I’m just kind of, I feel like I’m... tossing darts, maybe. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Because you’re asking a lot of questions today, and I’m wondering if you’re feeling more of a need to engage with me?
CLIENT: Sure, I love engagement! (chuckles) (pause)
THERAPIST: Are you feeling a little lost today?
CLIENT: Umm... I don’t know. (pause) I’m trying to explore, but I don’t know what exactly I’m exploring. (therapist affirms) (pause) Yeah. I guess I feel uncertain about what I’m talking (chuckles) about, so...
THERAPIST: Intuitive in terms of...?
CLIENT: If you want him to be to articulate this, or you know, if he... You know, I’m saying that... maybe he can’t, you know. I’m not saying that, “Oh, he’s not smart enough to articulate that,” but you know like, I was not being very fun, you know. He was like, ","P1-N400BB1":"on... (chuckles) so weird like, but it was like, I wanted to take a walk. But then... so he joined me. But then like, as soon as we left his apartment, he was like, on the phone with his friend like, I don’t know, “What are you doing? Come join us.” I was like, he just knows that I’m, ","P1-N400BB2":"you know... not very chatty or, you know, fun right now, so, he’s already looking for... a back-up or like, somebody else to make, to give him the kind of stimulation he’s seeking, you know? [00:36:45]
THERAPIST: You have a lot of things to be sad about. (client chuckles) In terms of what happened to you. (client affirms) But you have so much potential for the future.
CLIENT: Yeah? (therapist affirms) And when you say that, do you mean like, happy... or like... jumping off the couch (chuckles)...
THERAPIST: Maybe moments of that, but... I think, to have a really productive, creative, fulfilling life.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Is time over?
THERAPIST: Sorry?
CLIENT: Are we done or...?
THERAPIST: We really just have a minute left. What made you think of the time at this moment? Do you know? [00:42:32]
CLIENT: No, it was like... your statement was kind of like... (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I wasn’t actually aware of the time. I was making a statement. I wasn’t aware of it being the end, but it almost is the end, actually, for today. (client affirms) Are you, do you feel that way? Do you feel like you have the potential for a, you know, fulfilling, creative life?
CLIENT: I want to. I want to believe that very, very strongly. I think I’m getting there. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: So you are away next week, is that correct? (client affirms) So then I will see you in a week and a half. It’s the 17th. Is that...? No, next Monday is the 17th. So the 24th?
CLIENT: Oh, you’re not here next Monday?
THERAPIST: I thought you were away next week?
CLIENT: Yeah, all of next week, yeah.
THERAPIST: Right. And then, so then not next week, but the following Monday.
CLIENT: Yeah, on Monday.
THERAPIST: So next week is the 17th and the 19th, and you won’t be here, right? (client affirms) But then the 24th... (client affirms) I’m not going anywhere.
CLIENT: Oh, okay.
THERAPIST: I’ll be at work.
CLIENT: Not yet. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Sorry?
CLIENT: Not yet! [00:43:32]
THERAPIST: Not yet! I will be going away for some period of time. But I do think, I think that I told you that I’m due like, the third week in June, like the end of it. But I think even by like, midto late July I’ll be in a day or so here, you know, for a couple of hours. I’m happy ","P1-N400F31":"just to see you then. (client affirms) Okay? Okay. Very good, so I’ll see you in a week and a half.
CLIENT: Okay! See you, have a good, I don’t know, spring break, if you can call it that. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Take care.
CLIENT: You, too. Bye.
