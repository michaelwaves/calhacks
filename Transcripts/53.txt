THERAPIST: Hi, come on in!
CLIENT: How are you, how are things?
THERAPIST: Good, thank you. (pause)
CLIENT: (sigh) Whew! So, yeah. It’s been a busy couple of weeks, to say the least. Soccer started, so that was good, good to get back to practice and get after it. Also, my old… actually going after this, I’m going back to Google to talk to my old manager; she wants to hire me back ","P1-N400111":"in the role that I should have been in before I left, so… That’s actually really exciting for me.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Is that part of the reason that you left? You weren’t happy with (blocked).
CLIENT: Yeah, well the way that it worked was, I had run our team for like six months while she had some family stuff she had to deal with. So I just, you know, I took the reins and ran her team as the lead and was essentially the manager of this team. The expectation that I had from her boss was that ","P1-N400151":"when there was… the reason I was doing that was not just because I’m a good guy, but so it would give, you know, give me the preparation necessary for when the next lead position opened and that would be mine. [00:01:28]
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like now you feel like you have more power, negotiating power.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I mean that’s, I think that’s part of what it comes down to, it’s a very, it’s… I don’t’ know what happened. At some point, at Google, someone gave me the advice that you have to make your own career, like no one is going to help you do it. ","P1-N400311":"So no one is like looking out for your best interests unless you are. And I internalized it, and I’ve always been sort of working towards fitting together pieces together that I think will help. I don’t know where I am, Doctor. I don’t know what the end looks like, and I’m okay ","P1-N400312":"with that. But I’m content at this point to pull together experiences that will continue to grow me, you know, so I can move sort of higher up the organization, but also give me broader and broader perspective. [00:09:03]
THERAPIST: What parts of it have been bumpy?
CLIENT: Well I think, I mean, I think just the fact that we’ve gone through so much, right? We’ve broken up a couple of times, I’ve cheated on her, she’s weaponized her past against me, kind of, all of that. It feels like we’re a little past it now. I’m not sure…why. ","P1-N400411":"You know, maybe I’m at the point now where I’m just, I’m comfortable with that, but I also told her, like, don’t ever do that to me again, like don’t try to use that against me, because I can use things against you. Like, I don’t want to have to do that. I know that’s ","P1-N400412":"where I would go, if it came to it, and I’d rather not. And I think she’s better about, she’s more cognizant about it, you know?
THERAPIST: Do you feel like she used to tell you things to be hurtful?
CLIENT: I don’t think she did it… I think that was the consequence of what she did. I don’t think she did it deliberately. I do believe that she’s not that type of person. But I think the way that it would be in some regards, I think it was her, you know, hurt defense mechanism ","P1-N4004B1":"almost against getting into a relationship, right?
THERAPIST: Is that something that you expect?
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Is that something she has expressed to you or to other people or…?
CLIENT: The what? That we’re…
THERAPIST: Awesome!
CLIENT: It’s like, no that was an outward thing, right? She’s, so she’s like, I describe her as like 13-year old girl on Facebook, so she likes to do the whole, like, “This is how awesome, this is the awesome thing that I’m doing on Facebook” kind of thing. So I think ","P1-N400691":"that it’s important for her, especially because she’s like, she’s older than a lot of her friends and she’s super cognizant of her age and like how like how she’s been single for like ever! And so she’s like super cognizant of that, so she wants to show people, like, ","P1-N400692":"“Yeah, look, I can do it. I can pull it together, and like I’ve been really good. I’ve been with somebody good, and it’s really good.” And I think it’s tricky because that mental model breaks down when it breaks down between us. And the more people that you bring ","P1-N400693":"in and the more people that you put on this façade for, the more pressure you’re under to make it succeed. And when you’re under a lot of pressure to do something, you know, you squeeze and squeeze and squeeze and squeeze and then it actually it pops, it doesn’t finally help it ","P1-N400694":"be any more successful.
THERAPIST: So she feels insecure? [00:22:21]
CLIENT: A little… I think, I don’t think it’s that she feels… maybe insecure, I don’t know the way to put it. The way that she’s put it to me is that she’s always felt incredibly unlovable, and when she’s with me, she feels like she’s lovable, like ","P1-N4006D1":"she is, as an individual, capable of being loved. You know, and there is, I mean, obviously lots of things that you could go into about that.
THERAPIST: What does she do for work?
CLIENT: She’s a teacher.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Oh, I think you mentioned that.
CLIENT: Yeah, she’s a teacher over at Cheshire. Yeah, but, you know, that, I mean it’s not bad compensation for like, a teacher, but in the scheme of life software engineer, lawyer, anesthetician (corrects) anesthesiologist (chuckles)… I mean maybe, they’re probably anestheticians ","P1-N4008B1":"to the stars that are incredibly wealthy, too! And so it’s like, I think that’s also… I think ultimately, like as I’m talking, because I realize that we’re really good complements for each other. Like, we have enough stuff in the middle of the Venn diagram, you know, enough ","P1-N4008B2":"overlap that, like really important, like the compatibility, it’s not like they want to talk (inaudible). But there is enough different, where we can still learn from each other. [00:31:12]
THERAPIST: When I think of grounding, I think of an electrical charge. You ground an electrical charge.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That’s not the only meaning of grounding, but that’s a huge (inaudible) into it.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, that could also be true, because it is… I don’t know. I think, maybe, anchor is probably the right… You know, because I think about like a blimp, right? A blimp can kind of go wherever it wants to go and it will take a little time to get there, but it will get there. ","P1-N4009F1":"But like, eventually you don’t want the blimp to float away, right? You want to kind of have it… grounded, but yeah, anchored, whatever.
THERAPIST: How would other people know of your inside jokes and kidding? [00:39:20]
CLIENT: Well, sometimes you make a joke in front of somebody or sometimes you’re explaining it, you know, or you’re explaining like what happened and then it comes up. And then they end up getting like, “What do you mean? Like hold on, you joke around about that?” It’s ","P1-N400AF1":"like, “Well, yeah.” And I think that that… you know, that in the past probably bothered, I think that bothered both of us, but now it’s like… You know, these people in our lives that are our friends, and if they can’t handle the fact that we’re, that we’ve ","P1-N400AF2":"done some stupid stuff and now we laugh about it now. Maybe they’re a little bit too uptight to be our friends in the first place, so… [00:40:05]
THERAPIST: Seems like you want to make a new transition.
CLIENT: Well, I think it’s a gradual one, though. I certainly don’t feel like this is abrupt as anything else. You know, I feel like part of it is, and I know that, you know, you kind of grow up (inaudible\/blocked by siren), part of it’s just recognizing these people and realizing ","P1-N400C11":"where they fit in my life and what they do for me, and even what they don’t do. And what they do is they give me a really strong sense of family and brotherhood and friendship. And yeah, they’re fun guys to hang out with, and you know, on the rare occasion when it is, we go catch a movie, ","P1-N400C12":"grab a pizza, or go grab breakfast after a good workout, like… all for that! You know? [00:45:16]
THERAPIST: Well, on that note, we’re going to need to stop for today. But I will see you next week.
CLIENT: Yeah, absolutely.
THERAPIST: Good luck with your interviews.
CLIENT: Yeah, thank you.
THERAPIST: Or with your, I guess it’s an interview…
CLIENT: I don’t’ know; it’s my old boss, so it’s like I’ve had lunch with this woman six times since I’ve left Google and we sort of chat casually with relative frequency, so it’s more figuring out, “Okay, here is what I’m looking for in terms of ","P1-N400D11":"role and position, title and money and all of that. What do you have to offer? And where are you guys going and what are you trying to accomplish?” So… We’ll see!
THERAPIST: Well, good luck with that.
CLIENT: Thank you very much, and we’ll try next week
THERAPIST: I’ll see you next week; take care.
