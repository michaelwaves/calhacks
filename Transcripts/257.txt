DESCRIPTION: Client has returned from a trip abroad and is stressed about making enough money to pay rent, health insurance, and follow her passion.
THERAPIST: Hi.
CLIENT: Hi.
THERAPIST: Welcome back.
CLIENT: Thanks. (chuckles) It's okay to be back. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: Yeah. It's more fun there. I didn't want to come back. (chuckles) But here I am. (chuckles) I can't remember the last time we spoke or what we said. (chuckles) But it feels like it's been a lot longer because [I feel like a] (ph) different place. So I guess physically also because I'm moving.
THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm.
CLIENT: I'm moving out of Hamden. (pause) But I've kind of forgotten how this works. (chuckles) Like am I supposed to talk or -
THERAPIST: It sounds like it feels new all over again. It feels like it's new all over again.
CLIENT: Yeah, huh. Well, I mean, I think it's a good thing. Yeah, I mean (pause) It's I'm trying to I feel differently about a lot of things, I guess. I've just kind of lost my sense of being here which I really actually like because that gives me a chance to start again, to start fresh ","P1-N4001F1":"and feel really differently about myself. Well, maybe not myself, but like act differently. So, let's see. I'm back. I have almost moved out of Hamden. I'm in Arlington now. I'm not really sure how long I'm going to be there.
THERAPIST: For?
CLIENT: (chuckles) Another degree.
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: It will just give me deadlines and stuff because after MSU, I was just left with a very bad kind of understanding of writing and of what I could do with it. It was just not enough, that one-year program was just not enough and it prepared me -
THERAPIST: I think you're unhappy because there's something that feels really wrong on the inside.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And I don't that these things are ultimately going to make you happy.
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: They may make you happy if other things happen.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But I don't want to since you've come here to seek my professional opinion, that I don't know how these things that you feel that really make you feel terrible about yourself and these fantasies you have about how you could get better are going to change without some sort of intervention.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And I would hate to see you sort of just run away in the hopes that something else will help.
CLIENT: It's true. (chuckles) Yeah, that's true. (pause) Yeah, I definitely see what you're saying. I feel like I mean, yeah, what you said about something on the inside that is wrong. I know what you're saying because even when I was in Nepal, I did have those dark moments.
THERAPIST: Because it's compensating. It's not actually addressing, it's compensating.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And I would say only momentarily compensating for something that feels very wrong on the inside.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean, you've tried before to sort of do things to feel differently about yourself, but they're very short-lasting.
CLIENT: Yeah. You're probably right. (chuckles) Like what have I done that has only been temporary?
THERAPIST: Well, like you know sort of getting sort of seeking out outside approval, affiliating with people who have these beautiful lives [so you can sort of be part of] (ph) that beautiful life rather than feeling that what's beautiful is inside.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That they're sort of solutions to things that really end up in the end making you feel quite empty.
CLIENT: Yeah, it's true. I don't know like what the fix for that what the permanent long-term fix for that would be.
THERAPIST: Well, I don't know what all of the fixes could be, but this could be I don't usually like to think of it as a fix, but this could be one way to really address what feels very wrong inside.
CLIENT: Yeah. This as in -
THERAPIST: Therapy.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean, that's what we talk about.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And that's what we work on. And for you especially, it seems like there are these ways and in a sense, they're almost magical the way you describe them.
CLIENT: (chuckles)
THERAPIST: You'll do this and you'll feel better. You'll do this, you'll get with this person and you'll feel better and things will be great.
CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah.
THERAPIST: And they are very understandable wishes. I'd like to help you get to those places, or at least partially get to those places, in ways that are more realistic.
CLIENT: Yeah. Like what would be unrealistic? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well, you know, that you would sort of get some sort of accolades that would change the way you feel about yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Accolades are not going to change the way you feel about yourself. They're just not.
CLIENT: Hmmm. (pause) So like quitting my job is not like a is that like a quick fix, you think?
THERAPIST: I hadn't really thought about it in term of that, but if you need other things in your life like food and therapy and so forth, that might not be such a good idea right now.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And even getting another degree, I don't know.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I understand what you're saying. It creates some structure, but that's part of the problem in the sense that you're trying to find some inner desire, inner motivation to pursue your dreams, so it's also kind of an external solution that I imagine costs money.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) So I guess I mean, not as much [as a private school] (ph).
THERAPIST: Well, again, I know nothing about your field -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: so I don't want to presume, but it does also make me think about wanting to continue to be a student.
CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Rather than someone who has sort of graduated and needing to create something for themselves.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, like, see the thing is that I feel like I'm really at a crossroads at the moment. The same crossroads that I've always been at, maybe. (chuckles) Is it a beautiful house or a beautiful book? Really I see it as either\/or in the sense that right now, I could have a full-time job and, ","P1-N400B51":"you know, save up money. And I wouldn't be saving up that much, maybe like a few thousand dollars a year, and it would slowly add up to where I could buy a house. Or I could quit my job and take the time it needs to work on my project.
THERAPIST: Did she ever read you stories?
CLIENT: My uncle did, like her brother. He had bought me a lot of books right before he came to the US. Yeah, and like she would record like I would just make up stories. I would read some story, and then she would record my voice as I was narrating the story, and then I'd sort of forget to make ","P1-N400DD1":"up my own version of the story.
THERAPIST: When I listen to you often I think about how difficult it is for you to find focus and commit to something. I often see you in the image of someone sort of wandering about.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I guess I've always been like that. I wish I could be steady and stick to something. (chuckles) I never had the knack for doing that. (pause)
THERAPIST: And your being here one way of looking about being here is it's like taking your life more seriously.
CLIENT: Hmmm.
THERAPIST: Taking yourself more seriously, taking your life choices more seriously.
CLIENT: Yeah. I definitely know I have the need for therapy, I just kind of I'm wondering even if I quit the job, I'll probably want to switch insurance because I inquired at my current workplace about switching from an HMO to a PPO, right?
THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm.
CLIENT: And they said that (inaudible at 00:28:11) doesn't allow you to do that like in the middle of the year. But then if I quit my job and get a new insurance, then maybe I could off-the-bat ask for a PPO.
THERAPIST: Don't you get insurance isn't there an insurance policy through school?
CLIENT: Yeah, but that's kind of going to be expensive if I don't have a job. Yeah, it's like $2,000 a semester. (chuckles) That's a lot. Because state insurance is cheap or it's free. Like if I'm barely earning anything (chuckles) then I might qualify for it.
THERAPIST: Yeah, that's about they cover you for the year, so it's about $300 a month. The $2,000 a year is about $300 a month.
CLIENT: That's a lot of money. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well, this is in no way to discourage you pursuing your dreams, but you need to eat -
CLIENT: (chuckles)
THERAPIST: and have basic needs met.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I get worried for you that there's just this almost kind of avoidance of that, not taking it that seriously enough.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And if you don't have $500 extra to give to your mother, you don't have $500 to give to your mother.
CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. Well, I need to give because where is she going to live?
THERAPIST: Would she go to a homeless shelter? Where would she go?
CLIENT: I don't know. (chuckles) But I think she yeah, I could give up my place.
THERAPIST: No, I want to stay with this for a second.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Would she go to a homeless shelter?
CLIENT: I don't know. (chuckles) I mean, she has a little bit of savings, so she probably could pay her rent until the savings run out. But yeah, I think the expectation is that I would help. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well, I'm sort of putting aside the expectation. What would she do?
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I think she would. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: She would live in a homeless shelter? That's what she would choose to do?
CLIENT: I don't know. This is not even like a possibility. I haven't discussed this I mean, this has never been brought up, so I'm not sure.
THERAPIST: Does she know how hard it is for you to make ends meet?
CLIENT: Well, like if I have a job, then it's not hard. But if I -
THERAPIST: It sounds like right now it might be.
CLIENT: Yeah, I know. (pause) I don't know. I feel so tight. I mean, what is the expression? What's the word? I feel so confused, like torn, yeah. I want to be able to support her and make her happy, but that it is making me unhappy. (chuckles) And it's just not my goal. Like I remember the year that ","P1-N401331":"I was full-time. I got no work done, and I was really unhappy about that. I paid off my loans and that's a good thing. But really, I just I will not feel good about myself until I have something to show for my work. That's just -
THERAPIST: That's part of the problem. I'm not at all discouraging you. I think it's wonderful.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I think your passion is the deepest sense of self-expression, especially with someone with talent. But that statement "I won't feel good about myself until this," that's the problem, that there's an "until."
CLIENT: I know. I hate that I've been thinking this way. (chuckles) I don't know. Like why should I feel good about myself? Like why I mean, why even think in those terms? I know that is great that there's actually people out there who don't even give two hoots about whether they're likeable or ","P1-N4013D1":"not. They're there, you know? (chuckles) They are just undeniably there, you know?
THERAPIST: What is your thought about not having therapy? What will happen if you don't have it?
CLIENT: I guess I could go back to the old ways of thinking which are harmful for me. I know it would mean that I would take care of some really deep-seated notions I have about things that are harmful right now. I know that.
THERAPIST: That's pretty big.
CLIENT: Yeah, I know. I mean, I am thinking that even if I do quit, then I'll definitely look into whatever new insurance I get and see if I can still continue. I mean, it's not I don't want to stop it just for the sake of stopping. (pause) I just wonder if I could just feel that way for an extended ","P1-N4015B1":"period of time instead of just on vacation, you know? Feeling like I'm not being judged and I am, you know, this whole person that people like and want to talk to and want to get to know.
THERAPIST: Yes, we have a lot of work to do.
CLIENT: (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I mean it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I'm very serious about that.
CLIENT: You mean unless we do this, people won't want to know me? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I don't think it has anything else to do with people and their perceptions and their feelings about you.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I think it has to about you and how you feel about yourself and how you see other people seeing you based on those feelings.
CLIENT: Hmmm. (pause)
THERAPIST: I think that we can help you feel more fortified -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: so that these I mean, we're all affected by other people's opinions and feelings of us. It's not like that ever goes away.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But a little more sturdy so it doesn't feel like it sort of can make or break a moment or a day -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: or a week or a month.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly what I feel when that happens. (chuckles) For sure. (pause)
THERAPIST: It's like, you know, different types. You can do all sorts and types of exercise but what's really recommended, no matter what you do, is building up your core, right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I'm sure you've heard this expression, building up your core.
CLIENT: Yeah. I know my core, both emotional and physical, is very weak. (chuckles) I do want a strong core. (chuckles) I think I'm doing a social service (chuckles) by coming here because if I'm unpleasant, then I think people around me will not have a good time either. (chuckles) And like some people, ","P1-N4018D1":"you know, there are others who don't want to just throw me away. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: What about doing this for you?
CLIENT: Sure, why not? (chuckles) I just you know the very nice opinion I have of myself, so doing things for myself is not really going to motivate me to do anything if you say it's for me. (chuckles) (pause)
THERAPIST: Where my mind went -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: is like if you and Chris (ph) come in here and then somehow you have the bag which is therapy when it was sort of maybe for him, or at least for the two of you, and then you got the bag.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I don't know. I do have a bag. (chuckles) And then last night, he said he needs therapy too because he's so confused. Just the whole thing, whether we should be together or not. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: This certainly wouldn't be your last opportunity for therapy, but the longer you wait, the harder it is.
CLIENT: Yeah, like I said, I'm not I'm hoping I can still continue so that I could even make an appointment for next week with the hopes that somehow the money will come. Yeah, I mean, if I hadn't told anything at my job, or even if I say anything, maybe they'll be like "Hey, you can do this part-time." ","P1-N401A51":"(chuckles) But if they do, that means they'll have more money. I don't know.
THERAPIST: Are they not giving you health insurance?
CLIENT: No, they are. It's full-time.
THERAPIST: Would they be willing to give you health insurance for two-thirds time?
CLIENT: If it's part-time, yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: So that would solve part of the problem, wouldn't it?
CLIENT: No, because then I wouldn't be able to switch.
THERAPIST: But you could switch at some point, just not now.
CLIENT: Umm, yeah.
THERAPIST: Isn't that what they said?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So we could figure something out until you could switch.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You could probably switch by the end of the year or something. That's not too far away.
CLIENT: That's true, yeah.
THERAPIST: As long as you could switch at some point, we can figure something out.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think if I began the new insurance, that might be a solution because then it will be a new insurance.
THERAPIST: Yeah, but that insurance is not going to cover this.
CLIENT: Oh, it's not?
THERAPIST: No. Actually, they don't let private people in private practice be state insurance providers. I think you have to be a clinic. State insurance will not help.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: You get a PPO plan through your employer.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And I'm pretty sure I know it's expensive. Your university plan would also probably cover part of this. State insurance will not.
CLIENT: Okay. Hmmm. Okay, that's good to know that state insurance is not the answer.
THERAPIST: It does seem like one good option is if they're willing to have you insured, even if you aren't full time, and at some point you can switch, you know.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: We could work something out in the interim. I mean, that's a possibility.
CLIENT: Yeah. Or I could look into the university -
THERAPIST: The university health plan is probably I've seen people from Amherst, not for a while though.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: But I recall that they had some pretty good coverage.
CLIENT: Okay. I could ask about that.
THERAPIST: And they do even though it's a school, they cover you through it usually starts in September and they cover you through the end of August, so it is for a full year. It's not per semester.
CLIENT: Okay, yeah, if that works then I'll do that because the other job option that I have is with UMass.
THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm.
CLIENT: And if I'm working there, they should pay part of the health insurance, you know? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Yeah, who knows how they do things full time. I don't know -
CLIENT: Yeah, I'll find out. I'll find out on Thursday.
THERAPIST: Okay. We do need to stop for today.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So what was I going to say? Did I send you the invoice? I did charge your card for the three sessions.
CLIENT: Yeah, no, I didn't get it.
THERAPIST: I'm sorry. I'll make sure to send you the invoice. So let's look at so that was for all not today, but the three sessions.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So that would have included that. Okay, so what do you want to look at our next appointment for?
CLIENT: (pause) I don't know. (chuckles) You said you had a 5:15, I'm not sure, next Tuesday. Will that work or not?
THERAPIST: I don't know if I have that. Unfortunately those evening times fill up pretty quickly.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Could you do something at 9:15 on Tuesday? I'm not here on Monday.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Is that too late?
CLIENT: No. (pause)
THERAPIST: I could do 9:10. I don't know if that helps.
CLIENT: How about I make Wednesday?
THERAPIST: Wednesday I'll only have something mid-day. I don't have anything or in the afternoon, later in the afternoon.
CLIENT: What time?
THERAPIST: Not that late, though. It will be 3:45.
CLIENT: Sure, you could put me down for that because I have to talk to my boss about working from home or just quitting. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Okay, so then I have you down on September 5th -
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: at 3:45.
CLIENT: Okay. I've got to write that down because I have a tendency to forget. (pause) I didn't get my checkbook in again (chuckles) but -
THERAPIST: That's okay. You can just pay me for today the next time.
CLIENT: Maybe like a monthly thing.
THERAPIST: That's fine too. That's completely fine. That's not a problem.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Okay, sure. So I'll see you next Wednesday at 3:45.
CLIENT: Sounds good.
THERAPIST: Okay, take care.
CLIENT: You too, bye.
