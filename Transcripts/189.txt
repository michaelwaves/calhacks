DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her insecurity in relationships and how she keep sabotaging them. Client discusses her low self esteem and self confidence, and how it impacts her relationships and profession.
THERAPIST: Come on in! (pause) (inaudible) [00:00:27]
CLIENT: (pause) I guess last time I was talking about connections and thinking like, it's mostly my fault (chuckles), but how I feel insecure in myself so... No matter what the other person does, I feel, um... disconnected from them. But sometimes, I feel like there isn't, or I can't really trace the ","P1-N4000D1":"source of insecurity or the reason for feeling insecure at that moment, that day, you know? (therapist responds) [00:01:51]
THERAPIST: What's the "I don't know" at the end?
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. (chuckles) Just talking...
THERAPIST: Are you feeling uncertain about what you're saying?
CLIENT: Uh... yeah, I guess I am. I don't know! (chuckles) (pause) Just feeling a little insecure (chuckles) in the past few days; I don't know. Kind of need to understand. (sighs)
THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?
CLIENT: I don't know. Am I thinking? (chuckles) Just kind of spaced out. (sighs) (pause) I guess about categories and why sometimes my categories are so strict, you know, like you've mentioned before. Um... (chuckles) (pause) Maybe it's because like, I only see things moment to moment or, in the past, ","P1-N4003B1":"I did. Like maybe I didn't have a sense of like, the largeness of time and didn't have the patience to see that and realize that, it's like the long road and people change and you know... You lose them, but then you meet them again or, you know, in different shape and form, (therapist responds) and ","P1-N4003B2":"there are all kinds of possibilities of growth and stuff. [00:21:31]
THERAPIST: I feel like sometimes when I'm quiet during sessions, or at least the beginning part of sessions, that you tend to kind of draw inward more. (client affirms and chuckles) Do you think so?
CLIENT: I guess, yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm wondering what to make of that.
CLIENT: Drawing inward as opposed to...? I mean like, being more quiet?
THERAPIST: Yeah, like when you sense that I'm, you know, more quiet, that somehow, you kind of pull in more.
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess, not always, but just today, I feel like it, but I'm trying to fight it, I'm trying to come out. (chuckles) (sighs) [00:23:55]
THERAPIST: What is it that you have to fight?
CLIENT: Just fight, yeah, whatever I'm fighting. Just the sense of feeling bad and low, I guess. (chuckles) I'm trying to fight it. (pause) Like you know, things are kind of ending. I'm sad a little, but I guess I'm telling myself, "They're not ending! They're just pausing. I'll see this person again, ","P1-N4004D1":"I'll see that person again. I'll have, you know, the workshop thing again. I'll have it and you know like, it's just a temporary hiatus and you know, during this hiatus I have a plan," you know? If I don't like the plan, I can make another plan! (chuckles) You know, and there'll be, yeah, there'll be ","P1-N4004D2":"hangouts and there'll be... It's so weird (chuckles) like, I went to a dance party last night and it was like, sometimes these things just like, don't have any effect (chuckles). [00:25:21]
THERAPIST: What do you mean, "no effect"?
CLIENT: Well, you know like for me, I love to dance and like, I've never really gone to a dance party before (chuckles). I've been like, all my life, "That's what I want!" This was like, you know, the... It was like, tailor-made for me, because it was like, you know, a writers' dance party. Everyone ","P1-N400511":"was... Then when I do go sometimes or, you know, once or twice to a bar, where there is supposed to be dancing, no one is dancing. Here everyone was dancing for hours, and the music was great, and I was dancing with friends. So it's like, you know, God gave me (or you know, whoever, whatever, you know), ","P1-N400512":"I had this, you know, perfect thing that I've always wanted and it still like, "Oh, yes..." (chuckles). [00:26:15]
THERAPIST: I would say especially.
CLIENT: Yeah. Like (therapist starts, stops) no, it's like, why is there a reason to be conscious? (chuckles) What were you saying? [00:27:23]
THERAPIST: Well, I was sort of going to ask along those lines like, what do you think people are seeing?
CLIENT: I don't know. I mean, they were all having fun, too. And I just, I was having fun, too. So like, I didn't really do anything embarrassing, so...
THERAPIST: What does a party girl mean?
CLIENT: I don't know, like taking drunk photos (chuckles) of someone and putting them on Facebook. But you know like, I wanted to take photos of these guys and like, you know, it's not going to happen again, so... (chuckles) It's a once in a lifetime thing, so I should like, allow myself to have that ","P1-N400631":"experience and not be embarrassed by it (chuckles), you know? It's like, what's wrong with me? Some people have only those photos and yet you feel, you don't think that they are party people at all. It's just, I think, "Oh yeah, they've had fun! They've led a good life." I don't think of them and (makes ","P1-N400632":"sound of dismissal), but I think of myself as that. (chuckles) (therapist responds) I don't know why. [00:29:19]
THERAPIST: What is that look? You're looking at me in a particular way.
CLIENT: Oh, am I? (therapist affirms) No, nothing has changed. See you.
THERAPIST: You're trying to see me? (client affirms) Am I blurry?
CLIENT: Yeah (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Huh!
CLIENT: Well, no, I was just looking out and the window is too bright and like, now I can't see you. (chuckles) Like, it's taken me like, a lot of like, and I still haven't been able to reconcile this like, the fact that you know, I need physical intimacy of the kind that I enjoy like... I'm still like, ","P1-N400771":"weirded out by that, you know? The fact that I'm seeking it and, you know, outside of Chris, you know. (therapist responds) We've broken up and not really have come to terms with that, because (chuckles) we're still like, you know, seeing each other and hanging out and stuff. (therapist responds) I ","P1-N400772":"don't know. (inaudible) that's the big narrative. (therapist responds)
THERAPIST: I had a couple of different thoughts. The one thought I had about like, sort of looking toward me, withdrawing, maybe I look blurry is sort of like this reaching out and wanting something to hold on to. (client affirms) And I'm sure if it's there, if you can even see it?
CLIENT: Oh, I see it. I mean, I know I've been doing, I've been seeing you for a year and a half and it's, I'm still that way (chuckles). So maybe it's not going to change or go away or maybe it will eventually, I don't know.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm sorry; I'm trying to process what you said. So you're thinking that... Yeah, how did, I'm not sure how you took my comment. Like, did you find that I was sort of pointing out something wrong? [00:34:36]
CLIENT: No, I'm just saying that you're pointing out a behavioral, you know, aspect. I feel like I'm thinking, "Maybe this is the way I am, just like needier than other people or like I'll always have this," yeah. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: (affirms) I certainly wasn't thinking that.
CLIENT: Oh. What were you (chuckles) thinking?
THERAPIST: I was thinking that it sort of speaks to all the things that you're talking about, in terms of your emotional state, and trying to figure out how much you should or could rely on other people, how much should you expect from other people, how much you should expect from yourself. (client ","P1-N400871":"affirms) I was thinking about that. And I wasn't even, when I made that comment, I wasn't thinking about what it means; I was just sort of commenting, sort of observing something.
CLIENT: Oh, okay. (chuckles) Yeah, that's more useful, I guess. (pause) What was your second thought? [00:35:48]
THERAPIST: It was more about the content of what you were saying, but I'm more focused on this now.
CLIENT: Oh. (pause) No, I'm interested in hearing it. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well, my second thought was just like, sort of the different categories and thinking about how different they are. I can either have someone who I really want, and is sort of sexually very interesting, but he won't call and he won't do this like... (client affirms) Like I can have this or ","P1-N4008F1":"I can have this. (client chuckles) Like they're very separate (client affirms) and they're not only separate, they're, it seems like they're mutually exclusive, like you can have this, or you can have this. [00:36:34]
CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) I'm trying not to think that way, I'm trying to be like, okay, the, you know, interesting person to be, to care more. And I, last week... Do we have time? (therapist affirms) Yeah, I mean, last week, he was like, crying. (chuckles) I was totally shocked like...
THERAPIST: What was he crying about?
CLIENT: I don't know, because I found out he was seeing, like dating other women. He said, you know, his parents made him do that. I don't know how much of that is true, but I was just like, you know like, I met him at a bar. I was like, you know, "This is not working out. Let's end it." He was like, ","P1-N400951":""No, let's give it another shot." Then you know like, I had a little too much to drink and then afterwards, he was like, I was telling him, "I'm not, you know, good enough for you. You should find someone else." Then he just started crying. (chuckles) He was like, "I wish you could see yourself from ","P1-N400952":"my eyes. You're so much better off than what you think you are." He was just crying. I was just like, "Wow. Where did that come from?" (therapist responds) But then, you know, like the next day, he was superficial again (chuckles), so it's like... "You know, you open up and it's like, the window is ","P1-N400953":"like, shut again. [00:37:58]
THERAPIST: What makes you say, what did you say, "You can do better than me"? (client affirms) Why did you say that?
CLIENT: Well, I just feel like that when I'm with... I say that to every guy (chuckles). Not every guy, you know, like I've said that to Chris a billion times. I don't know, just because I feel like I'm like, emotionally unstable and (sighs) you know like, my parents are divorced so that, you know, ","P1-N400991":"to some people, it may matter, who are more traditional or whose parents are more traditional. But I don't quite know what I'm doing with my life and (chuckles). Whereas other people again, going the more traditional route, have, you know, sensible degrees and sensible jobs, so... [00:38:50]
THERAPIST: Well, you believe it. [00:39:45]
CLIENT: Yeah. Which is funny, because like, I am, I think I'm a complex person and I complicate things, and you know. This is such a simple way of thinking, right? (therapist responds) (chuckles) And as an aspiring writer, I see all the complications and, yeah. It's weird. (chuckles) (pause) Why doesn't ","P1-N4009F1":"it stick? Why doesn't, yeah... That's the question, like why doesn't it stick, that this guy cried? Or why doesn't it stick that I've had good... satisfactory (chuckles) sexual experiences with Chris, you know? Why doesn't that stick? (chuckles) (pause) I think it doesn't stick because I'm like... I'm ","P1-N4009F2":"mad at them, or some other emotion overcomes, with my reason. Then I'm like, "Oh, yeah, the reason why I don't want to be with you is that you're not emotionally available and you, you're not exciting enough." (chuckles) (inaudible) That's wrong.
THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?
CLIENT: I'm thinking if these guys think like that about me, that, "Oh, yeah. You can't do this whole entire thing," and how I would feel (chuckles), if they thought that way. I guess I would be mad and so... (pause) If they did think that way, I would think, "Oh, they just, they're looking for excuses ","P1-N400A51":"to break up with me." (chuckles) So... Because I guess that's what I'm doing, so...
THERAPIST: Hmm. That's an interesting thought. We're going to, unfortunately, we're going to need to end on that, okay? (client affirms) I will see you on Monday. (client affirms) Great!
CLIENT: Have a good weekend!
THERAPIST: Thank you! You, too!
