DESCRIPTION: Client has anger issues and is trying to distance himself from the negativity in his life to slow down his tantrums. Client has a strained relationship with food and his family because of his childhood.
CLIENT: Thank you.
CLIENT: I've had a really good last two weeks. My girlfriend and I just got back from vacation. And this is the first vacation in like three years that we haven't gotten in a fight. And it was actually very enjoyable. It was very relaxing. And we just did, you know, things that couples do, just a lot ","P1-N400111":"of activities, a lot of running around. But we had fun. And I guess I really hadn't experienced that side of my relationship. I hadn't really experienced the good things that do come out of my relationship, the good times that we have had or this is how, you know, our relationship should have been as ","P1-N400112":"opposed to the way it was before. [00:03:01]
THERAPIST: How do you mean "supposedly?"
CLIENT: Well, they're family. You're supposed to love them no matter what. And, for me, I don't have that connection with them. I don't have that emotion to them. In my mind, they're just acquaintances. They're just people that I've known along the way and every time there's a holiday or something they're ","P1-N400211":"just there. Would I go out of my way to see them? Probably not. Have I made it clear that I don't want to associate with them? I have. [00:09:57]
THERAPIST: Well, the upshot it you're seen as the bad guy. It doesn't seem like you would accomplish anything that way.
CLIENT: No. And that's what I've come to because, you know, back when, you know, I wanted to stir the pot and do all these things, I had come to the realization was it's not going to matter if I go or not. I already have this image of being the bad guy. I already have this perception that people look ","P1-N400271":"at me that because of my mother, because of, you know, what we've done as children, you know, we can't do any right. And it is what it is. I've come to the reality of it is that's what it's going to be. But I've also come to the reality where I'm not going to put on the fake smile. I'm not going to ","P1-N400272":"put on that everything is good in my life with them, that, you know, we have no problems. You know, that's a reality that needs to be faced. [00:11:57]
THERAPIST: Wait. I'm missing this. What is it that you need to get healthy? You need...
CLIENT: To not associate with the negativity that...
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: ...that my mother and everybody has towards my dad's sister and her family. I just don't want to be involved it in anymore. I'm sick of it. It's not my problem. It's not something I want to associate with anymore. That's something that they need to work out. And it frustrates me because my mother ","P1-N400311":"does just sit and think about it and get all worked up every time I'm home, you know, tries to tell me everything that's going on and I... [00:13:05]
THERAPIST: Well, what are you angry about?
CLIENT: I don't know. It's just... Like before I talked about when I used to get enraged, there were like certain symptoms that or situations that, when I was there, no matter what I couldn't control it. I was blacked out and I just get in a fury. Well, here, it's kind of the same way where it's something ","P1-N4003F1":"that'll be completely subtle that's not... (LAUGHTER) ...not a big deal by any means but I'll snap. I'll just get... My emotion will just go from zero, calm to very angry and I'll start, I'll take a deep breath because I can feel it coming and then I'll go and I'll scream or I'll sit down and I'll try ","P1-N4003F2":"to control my breathing. [00:19:07]
THERAPIST: Well, yeah. I mean, I guess it's hard for us to work on the anger if you're not sure what specifically sets you off.
CLIENT: I don't... And that's what's frustrating to me is I don't know what sets me off. [00:21:01]
THERAPIST: What upset you about it raining?
CLIENT: Because I had to go somewhere and right before I had to go out, it had to start pouring. And I was just cursing and just going in a little tantrum.
THERAPIST: And what were you cursing at?
CLIENT: The rain. Calling it every name in the book. Why it had to come now? Why couldn't you wait five minutes after I'd already was inside to my thing? It's always when I have to go out and do stuff. Something innocent like that I get irritated by. [00:24:15]
THERAPIST: It sounds like you felt the victim of it, like it was doing something to you.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) I guess. I don't know.
THERAPIST: How could you do this to me?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I'm going somewhere. How could you start raining?
CLIENT: Yeah. It happens all the time. Little things like that piss me off. That's... Nobody did anything to me. Nobody didn't plan anything. "Oh right as he gets out of the car we're going to rain." But that's what happens. That's what I'm going through right now. That's what I'm trying to work on ","P1-N400611":"is stupid little things like it raining right before I get out of the car. [00:24:59]
THERAPIST: Well, it does sounds like you feel kind of like the victim of something and it makes you feel helpless.
CLIENT: Could be. I mean, it could be the fact that, you know, I've been a victim, in my eyes, for a while since I was a child, you know, going back to my being overweight and just everybody picking on me and saying all the old things and, you know, me not being the athlete that I wanted to be because ","P1-N400671":"the weight held me back. I used to always say that if I had my little brother's body, I would have played somewhere for hockey. You know, I would have played somewhere for baseball. But I didn't. I guess I always felt bad for myself because I felt like I did this to me. I let this get this way and I'm ","P1-N400672":"the only one that can fix it. But when I'm a, I don't know, seven or eight year old boy, how can I control what my mother buys? How can I control what I eat? How am I supposed to know what's good for me, what's bad for me? [00:27:11]
THERAPIST: I was thinking, this is how you feel about your parents' house on many levels because you feel like they entice you with all sorts of stuff that tastes good but it bad for you.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: Like, "Here's some money. Here's some money. Stay here." But it's bad for you because it doesn't make you feel like you can be an independent person and take care of yourself and then you want to feel like, "Well, you know, all these nice things. I don't want to be on my own and have to do ","P1-N400711":"with less." [00:29:05]
CLIENT: And that's the hardest part is because it is a vicious cycle because every time you try to get away, you try to move on and better yourself, boom, they are sucking you back. And that's frustrating for me. I think the best thing that I ever did was I moved back home in November and I tried living ","P1-N400731":"the life that I thought I wanted and the more and more that I stayed there, the more I realized I don't want to be there. I don't want to surround myself with that anymore. I want the life that I have with my girlfriend. I want the life that, you know, is moving in the right direction. [00:29:57]
THERAPIST: Mmm.
CLIENT: To say, "That's fine. You don't like my kids. They're always wrong." Well, instead of them being hurt or, you know... Because she was hurt by what my grandmother did and said to us, she would always eat. So maybe she felt that we were hurting the same as her and we needed to comfort ourselves ","P1-N4007F1":"the way she did with food. I don't know because (SIGH) obesity did not run in my family. My mother was a very petite girl. She was about a hundred and fifteen pounds her whole life and then she says she married my dad and gained two hundred pounds, a hundred pounds. [00:35:07]
THERAPIST: Does she weigh over two hundred pounds?
CLIENT: She's about 180 now.
THERAPIST: Mmm.
CLIENT: She was over two hundred. But she was, you know... And all her sisters were the same way. My dad was obese as a kid. But he trimmed out as he got older and now he's back to, you know, his 185, 190 pounds. You know? And it frustrates me because I've always struggled with weight. Weight has been ","P1-N400871":"my major problem my whole life because I never feel I had it on top. I was never on top of it. I do... A perfect example. I do feel that I'm a victim because I'll stay on my weight lifting and my eating regime (ph) for two weeks and I'll only lose three pounds. [00:36:03]
THERAPIST: That's not bad. A pound and a half a week.
CLIENT: It's not. But for me, it's frustrating because I should be seeing more, because I watch like The Biggest Loser and I see what these people are doing and they're losing ten and fifteen pounds a week. But, I mean, I've lived through it. I've lost over a hundred pounds before. But I've gained it ","P1-N4008B1":"back, not all of it, most of it. And the hardest part is keeping your weight off once you lose it. And that's the fight that I deal with everyday is, okay, I can eat... And this is where my problem comes in is I can eat... (SIGH) I should eat fruits and vegetables and all that stuff. But I should also ","P1-N4008B2":"portion size them. However, my filter is, "Well, they're vegetables and they're fruits. I can eat as many as I want." [00:37:05]
THERAPIST: What do you mean if you could?
CLIENT: If I could.
THERAPIST: Well, why couldn't you?
CLIENT: Because it would be too hurtful on me. It would be too hurtful on me not to see them because I've already lived it once on my friends and that's how hurtful it was to me is not to be able to see people when you're fully capable of doing it. I just don't think I could last. (PAUSE) And that's... ","P1-N400971":"(SIGH) These are the decisions that I'm trying to make, I'm trying to go through in my head and discuss with my girlfriend what to do. [00:40:03]
THERAPIST: Well, but it does seem at some point you need to negotiate a different kind of relationship because you're still in this very dependent kind of relationship.
CLIENT: I agree. I agree. But the hardest part is bringing it up.
THERAPIST: I'm just talking about sort of with just the financial dependency too. It's not about what to bring up with them. It's what you do yourself, what decisions you make. [00:41:09]
CLIENT: Yeah. No, I agree. And that's something that I'm working on. I mean, I've come to the reality that (SIGH) you know, I've stopped feeling bad for myself financially because, you know, I took into account what you said about I could be out there making money. I'm choosing not to.
THERAPIST: I know. I was thinking, you know, it does seem like you feel a lot of things have gotten better in your life and I'm so happy to hear that. But there does seem things... Like we've been working together for quite some time and I'm not really sure what you're waiting for to make these changes. ","P1-N400A31":"Isn't it a bad situation to be almost thirty and to be completely reliant on your girlfriend and your parents?
CLIENT: No. Believe me, I know. I'm seeing it. [00:41:59]
THERAPIST: And the question is what... Yeah. I mean, it seems like you're almost waiting and the only person who can make that change is you.
CLIENT: No, I agree. And that's what I'm working on. That's the hardest part I've had because I guess I didn't really understand what I wanted until now and that's why it's taking so long for me to do all the stuff that I'm doing. It took me a while to understand that I really wanted to be an educator.
THERAPIST: What do you think stops you from going across the street and seeing if they have a job?
CLIENT: Because it's not what I want to do.
THERAPIST: You don't have to want to do it. You can do it for several months until you figure out what you want to do.
CLIENT: No, I understand that. But that's... I guess, you know, and my girlfriend has told me this, is there's kind of an entitlement where I have my master's degree. I'm not going to go bag groceries. I have... [00:43:01]
THERAPIST: Half the people have their master's degree at the food store. (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: Tell me about it.
THERAPIST: Go to those food stores.
CLIENT: Tell me about it. And that's the hard part too is because, you know, I guess I just got the bad experience from working at the restaurant when I had the master's degree and was working at the restaurant. I kind of felt it was beneath me when people just look at you and they're like, "You're ","P1-N400B91":"working at a restaurant? You have your master's degree?" I guess it all comes down to the status thing that we talked about earlier. Everything that my dad has and everything about, you know, what everybody in my, you know, the male culture of my culture is a status thing.
THERAPIST: But, I mean, to be frank, like, being unemployed is not a good status either. (LAUGHTER) [00:43:59]
CLIENT: But that's what our parents want, our parents would rather that. Because I have a friend who is the same nationality, same problems going on. Mom and dad pay for everything. When we try to better ourselves, mom and dad, I think they don't want to lose the power over us. They don't want to lose ","P1-N400BD1":"the decision making over us because that's the one thing they do have over us because they know if we need something, we can get it. I guess that's what I haven't overcome yet either is that's the hardest part is breaking away from your parents because, in my culture, it's not just me that I see it. ","P1-N400BD2":"It's a lot of people. My cousins have their own families, their own homes, are always over at their parents' with their kids. [00:44:59]
THERAPIST: But they have their own home.
CLIENT: But they have their own home but they're always going back to their parents'.
THERAPIST: Maybe. But it's still different to have your own home.
CLIENT: No. I would agree.
THERAPIST: I understand what you're saying.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: There's a whole culture.
CLIENT: There's a whole cultural thing and even they don't understand the new way of thinking. I mean, they don't understand how can you hate your family?
THERAPIST: But we're not talking about hating your family. We're talking about your having a different relationship with them.
CLIENT: No. I agree. But they don't...
THERAPIST: What does it matter what they think?
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: What does it matter what they think? Who cares?
CLIENT: I don't know.
THERAPIST: It's your life.
CLIENT: I know that. But I also want to be looked at as a positive person because maybe I've been looked at as a negative person my whole life.
THERAPIST: So you feel like having your own place would make you look like a negative person?
CLIENT: (SIGH)
THERAPIST: I mean, you feel like living with them makes you feel like, look like a positive person?
CLIENT: No because no matter what I'll always be judged. I guess it's the fearful of being judged by my family and by my peers because everything is judgmental and my girlfriend said this to me the other day and I didn't really understand it but she goes everything that I do, everything that she does, ","P1-N400E51":"we're judged on. I guess that's kind of what's scaring me about getting engaged is being judged. (PAUSE) Moving forward to the next step is scaring me because I want to be judged in a positive way, not a negative way.
THERAPIST: I guess I'm not sure how getting a job would make you be judged. I'm not following...
CLIENT: Well, it's a status thing and it's also ego thing for me is I, you know, the one thing that does, it bothers me a lot is, I don't want to be making minimum wage. And this is just me but I feel like I'm too good for it. I feel like it's beneath me and by all means, it's not. It's a job. But, ","P1-N400E91":"for me, the hardest part is getting over the fact that it's a job and, for me, with all the experience that I have, everything that I've been through, I feel that if I get a job in one of those places, I'm going to feel like I'm a high school or a college student again with a summer job and that's not ","P1-N400E92":"what I want.
THERAPIST: Well, yeah. We're going to need to stop but let's continue talking about this.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: This is really important.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So we'll see you in two weeks?
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Alright. See you then.
CLIENT: I believe it's the tenth. [00:47:59]
THERAPIST: Yes. Exactly.
CLIENT: Alright. Thank you.
THERAPIST: Good to see you. Oh, don't forget your umbrella.
CLIENT: Oh yeah.
THERAPIST: Even though it looks like it stopped raining.
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Okay. Take care.
CLIENT: Thank you.
