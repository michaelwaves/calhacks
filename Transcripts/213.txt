TITLE: Client "SN" Therapy Session Audio Recording, August 01, 2013: Client discusses his job and his feelings about death. Client discusses his issues with emotion and disconnect in conversations.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses his job and his feelings about death. Client discusses his issues with emotion and disconnect in conversations.
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in.
CLIENT: I'm trying to remember what we were talking about last time. (PAUSE) These days seem to go by very fast. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) I had a very interesting experience yesterday. We were... Every Wednesday morning, in my program, we have what we call open group which is kind of just a space for kind ","P1-N4000F1":"of reflections or kind of how we're doing in the program or any interpersonal issues or things we want to talk about. [00:01:11]
THERAPIST: Affection for the group?
CLIENT: For the group, for the experience as a whole, I think. I feel like it's really helped me in a lot of ways. Yeah. (PAUSE) But it was just funny. Like that was in the morning and then, in the last hour, we had a workshop on empathy. But it was mostly around compassion fatigue.
THERAPIST: Compassion fatigue?
CLIENT: Yeah. It's like nerdy trauma that comes with the work. And we watched this video but up by this clinic. Basically, it was just like a walkthrough of the hospital and there was people and they had these subtitles of what was going in their lives and they were just like sentences. [00:04:09]
THERAPIST: It sounds like what you do has many similar elements to what I do.
CLIENT: I think it's similar in some ways. Yeah.
THERAPIST: What do you see as the major differences?
CLIENT: I think the... In some ways, like the... (PAUSE) I'm not providing treatment for someone. I'm not diagnosing them. I'm not... I don't have a background that tells me kind of psychologically what might be going on. [00:07:05]
THERAPIST: Where is it that you do your internship?
CLIENT: At (inaudible at 00:09:25) Hospital.
THERAPIST: I have a colleague who does a lot of consultation to the (inaudible at 00:09:33) Care Unit. I think it's at BU. But he works with... He's not in a spiritual context but he works with physicians and residents. He's been there for years. He holds groups to process...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...their experience. But, again, it's not necessarily in a spirituality context except if they bring their spirituality to the, to that context.
CLIENT: Yeah. I think that's kind of what counselors provide is a space for that explicit engagement with it if it's an issue. [00:10:03]
THERAPIST: I guess maybe one way of thinking about what you're saying is with the patients who really sort speak to you in some way, short of what are they helping you to access in yourself?
CLIENT: I think one of my first patients that, or like experiences that they just like, I could feel something going on was one of my first on calls, I was called to do a sacrament to the sick for a patient who was borderline actively dying. [00:11:05]
THERAPIST: That sounds like Judaism. (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: There's some similarity.
THERAPIST: I'm dealing with very rudimentary terminology.
CLIENT: It's very... I can't come into a situation where I don't have a feeling or belief that's like, "Don't worry. You're going to a better place." We don't know that. I think it's so disheartening and hypocritic... You conjugate that. ...to do that, so say to someone.
THERAPIST: It certainly is if you don't believe it. [00:15:01]
CLIENT: Yeah. Which I don't. I think... Like I approach those questions with what I call appropriate agnosticism. So... (PAUSE) The... When I was sitting with him, I couldn't offer him any of that. So that's the limit of my capacity is I can't tell you anything about that. And, you know, death has always ","P1-N400571":"been something that has been very present in my thoughts. It's a question I've been curious about in some of my deepest emotional reactions have been around death. Not other peoples' deaths, the existential concept of it. [00:15:57]
THERAPIST: Did you feel that he wanted to run away?
CLIENT: I think he was in some detail. When I would come in to talk with her, he would leave the room which is very uncommon for spouses. I've only had two other times where I've entered a room, introduced myself, and then family or spouses have said, "Okay. I'll give you some space." [00:17:19]
THERAPIST: What do you have... What kind of strong feelings does it evoke?
CLIENT: In me?
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: It evokes the same feeling I had as a child, just this implosion of self and reality (inaudible at 00:20:45) which is a hard place to operate from.
CLIENT: I've been able to reframe that experience and that feeling into positive things that have allowed me to live. But I think that annoying reality of it at times makes it hard to not take small forays and denials from time to time.
THERAPIST: How do you see the connection between those two?
THERAPIST: I ask because they don't seem, you know, inevitable.
CLIENT: No. I think it's tempting to backslide into a space of if all there is ends, then what's the point? And yet, I know what a ridiculous position that is, given my experience and yet there is so much joy and so much beauty and so much power. And even the sorrow and even in those moments of whatever, ","P1-N400771":"you see this potential and this beauty like the husband I was talking about of the woman who died over the week. I could feel the love that he had for her. [00:23:03]
THERAPIST: Mmm.
CLIENT: And I think it, it's an experience that is really fundamentally altered the career choices I've made in my life and my vocation and all of this is I think really traces itself to that experience as a child. [00:24:01]
THERAPIST: Well, it reminds me of what we were talking about on Tuesday, I think it is, about sort of struggling with the impermanence of things. I mean, that's what you're talking about. It things aren't permanent, then what's the point? Is there a point or meaning in something you know will be impermanent?
CLIENT: And there is and actually impermanence is freeing to see pain and to see growth and to see change and it is our attachment to constancy that is the problem. But it's easy to get lost in the space where that doesn't feel like the case. It feels like it is throw away. It is more about the end ","P1-N400811":"destination than any other.
THERAPIST: Then, I guess in that case, if the end is the end, then you have nothing left but nihilism.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (PAUSE) And I don't... (PAUSE) I think it's a very self-centric philosophy though and that also worries me because my eventual death is not the end of the world or creation or the universe or God. It's not. It's the end of my current understanding of it, my current experience of ","P1-N400871":"it, my current (inaudible at 00:25:55). It's an end to the relationships I have with things within it. But the world doesn't end when I die. [00:26:05]
THERAPIST: Well, I was thinking not quite the opposite but something different, that it also speaks to you're not feeling connected to other people because your life can have meaning in other peoples' lives even when you cease to exist and that can be the meaning, at least part of it. So in thinking, ","P1-N400891":"in that nihilistic thinking, you don't have meaning to other people if you're not connected in any sort of deep way to other people.
CLIENT: Exactly. I think that's the run around of that. It's that the meaning that we're able to create in the world and the connection doesn't die with us. That's what (inaudible at 00:26:53) And I guess I... Maybe it's a fear of what's going to be left behind in those relationships. [00:27:09]
THERAPIST: That will be left behind isn't good or isn't enough or isn't much?
CLIENT: All three. Yeah.
THERAPIST: I think I'm beginning to understand, the beginning of understanding what you articulated in the first few sessions about feeling somewhat cut off from your emotional life because it's very much there. It just seems like there's a slight space between that and you and the way you talk about ","P1-N400911":"it. It's a little bit disembodied, a little bit abstract. But absolutely very present. But rather than being sort of directly sort of as one, it's kind of like there's little strings with a space in between. I don't know how else to describe it. [00:27:55]
CLIENT: I think that sounds like a perfect way. And I was struggling to figure out that. Because it is there. It is detached. It feels not like immediate all the time. Like when I have conversations with other people about it and some people definitely see a very not emotional person. But then other ","P1-N400931":"people see a very emotional person. And I think part of that is I know how to act emotional. But it's definitely there and it's not like I don't feel it. It's just that there is this disconnect at times and that there isn't a unity of it.
THERAPIST: Well, you think very deeply about emotional experience. So like the thought, maybe the thought is sort of the intervening or mediating factor. Like I know how you feel about things. I have some knowledge base of it, beginning to. We still are pretty early in our work. [00:29:07]
CLIENT: Hmm. (PAUSE) Yeah. Hmm...(PAUSE) Yeah. I don't know what the... I think it... (PAUSE) Like it's very hard to understand how I would express the texture of my emotions. I mean, I feel like I do that.
THERAPIST: Which is part of the problem. If you... (LAUGHTER) That's exactly the problem.
CLIENT: Yeah. Like I feel like... Like you say that and then my reaction is, "But I've described exactly the texture of my emotions."(LAUGHTER) [00:30:11]
THERAPIST: Maybe this won't go with this metaphor. But describing a texture only gets you so far. You have to touch it to actually understand the texture of something. You need to have a more immediate experience, immediate sensory experience of it to really know it, understand it, and feel it.
CLIENT: So I guess the question is how do... What's that? What it... How do we facilitate that, that process of directly engaging? [00:30:57]
THERAPIST: The good answer and also the, what's the word I'm looking for, not lame answer but something like that is, we're doing it. (LAUGHTER) It's both a good answer and not like cop out answer, I was thinking, not really a cop out answer but not a very descriptive.
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it just feels like every foreign. Like I think that that, like that code of disconnect of like... But I am telling you my emotions. I think that's the hard thing to me because it feels like it's there. Like when I say I feel upset, for me that feels like the end of the story. I ","P1-N400A71":"told you how I'm feeling. I'm feeling upset. So is it about like emotional, like displaying emotion? Like I guess I'm curious what that... [00:32:07]
THERAPIST: I see where you're going with this. (PAUSE) Well, maybe I'll frame it a little differently. I'm sort of thinking as I speak. It's sort of like how accessible you want to be to other people. And it seems like you other try to sort of straddle the line of wanting not to be too accessible but ","P1-N400A91":"not wanting to be inaccessible at the same time. And this may not... It may be at some times conscious. but I think that what I'm speaking about is far deeper about how you are in the world. It's probably maybe erratically conscious but more or less automatic.
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah. [00:32:57]
THERAPIST: I was thinking... The way I... I just had this thought about, you know, just our last five sessions together. I have both this feeling of you just dove right into this process but you're still sitting at the side of the pool, both. (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: Hmm... (PAUSE) Well, that's fun. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) What is the fun part?
CLIENT: Well, it's like (PAUSE) conceptually I can describe it all and I talk about it and I make the connections (inaudible at 00:33:47) I think is one of my strengths and I can do a lot of self-analysis and I do a lot of self-analysis. But that... It's basically a lot of that underlying guardedness ","P1-N400B31":"to myself. [00:34:07]
THERAPIST: Which is just (LAUGHTER) you know, an oxymoron.
CLIENT: Well, in some ways. I think I was... This past week, there was a... The guy that I had a thing going with this last semester and it kind of ended awkwardly and we kind of lost contact. And it was nagging at me and so I wrote him a letter like describing, you know, what was going on for me, kind ","P1-N400B91":"of what I was thinking, what I was feeling, and kind of what I hoped for in our kind of, a renewed friendship. That feels like a vulnerable thing to do in some ways.
CLIENT: So I thought my way into that vulnerability. But it's also pretty low stakes in that we don't have a very deep relationship so really the payoff is potentially a better relationship or pretty much the same. So maybe that's part of it. Maybe it's vulnerability when it actually matters deeply. ","P1-N400BD1":"I don't know. Again, I'm just thinking which is part of the problem.
THERAPIST: Well, I also think... Well, it could be part of the solution too. What I'm thinking is maybe what we're trying to put into words is episodic like particular instances and more just how you are in the world how you engage with the world.(PAUSE) Which is a sort of really... Being able to reflect ","P1-N400BF1":"on that and ultimately... I very much believe that incremental changes in someone makes huge differences. [00:37:05]
CLIENT: So... I'm curious like what... So it's like reflecting on... So for me it would be reflecting on the general kind of (PAUSE) the process of like distancing myself from people. Is that... [00:38:01]
THERAPIST: Maybe but I think... Yeah. Yeah. And a few thoughts. I mean, maybe. Reflecting (inaudible at 00:38:09) instrumental. And my other very whimsical thought... I mean, you're not here just to do whatever. My other more whimsical thought is if we could define it well, we could do it. Like something ","P1-N400C51":"needs to emerge.
CLIENT: I don't know what...
THERAPIST: Well, meaning like if we can sort of... "We need to do this to do this to do this." If we could define it well, maybe that wouldn't get to the core of the problem anyway versus seeing what emerges in this process.
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Hmm...
THERAPIST: And, you know, in that vein, we have maybe five or so minutes left and I just wanted to sort of as a segue to think about what the semester will look like just in terms of, you know, how often we meet, in terms of the structure of it, what we're talking about, you know, continuing to do together.
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:39:05]
THERAPIST: I don't know if you had any further thoughts about it or...
CLIENT: I think... I really appreciate the twice a week. I really have to figure out my schedule and that'll come together the first week in September, I think along with my job. And I think once that's kind of settled, how much time that will be, I think making a determination of one or two sessions ","P1-N400D31":"will make sense. I think I will try to aim for two if possible.
THERAPIST: It's a big investment sort of in a logistical practical way and emotionally. It's both.
CLIENT: Part of me feels like I need to make the investment now just in like I think it's a good one to make. [00:40:01]
THERAPIST: A good time is always now. (LAUGHTER) It's my general theory except if people are dealing with deeply disorganizing traumatic experience. But even that, this process can help to sort that out and then go forward. But in some ways the goal is different if people are sort of, there's not sort ","P1-N400DB1":"of an immediate event or sort of disorganizing. It's like, "Well, you have the opportunity to be and understand and explore."
CLIENT: Yeah. I appreciate that although I don't know what it looks like other than this. [00:41:03]
THERAPIST: Well, you know, one part of this process it's kind of an in vivo experience because the question is, "How do you engage with another person and how do you let someone know you?" This is an in vivo experience. (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: This is not just for the point of for the two of us but hopefully what you learn from it can then be, you know, extrapolated or, what's the word, applied maybe. I don't know if I have the exact right word for it. To your life. [00:41:57]
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah. I guess part of me really jumps to practicalities like, "Alright, if this is the case, so what does that mean? What does that mean I need to change and then I'll change it." But it's so much more subtle than being able to do that. So that's a frustration but also points to ","P1-N400E71":"the importance of the task. So...
THERAPIST: I was being kind of abstract philosophical about it (inaudible at 00:42:47) opportunity to learn from experience.
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Well, we'll see where we go then.
THERAPIST: What are you thinking?
CLIENT: I think I'm just... (PAUSE) I think... It all seems very abstract in terms of like what it actually means in my life and I think that's... I don't know what the... Like I know what in some ways the theoretically place we're working towards is (inaudible at 00:44:03) that it's sometimes hard ","P1-N400F31":"to believe it's real. [00:44:11]
THERAPIST: Well, we will end on that open ended question. So just, yeah, let me know when you have a better sense of your schedule. Logistically, my assistant will send you like the invoice for the copay and so forth. And your insurance... Because I'm not an in network provider, you insurance company ","P1-N400F71":"is going to send you the check. So when we see each other next, if you could just sign it over to me. They don't send me the check for whatever reason. They'll send you my payment essentially.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And if you... Did you let them know your new address?
CLIENT: No. I need to do that.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay. So anyway, those are just some logistical stuff. So I look forward to hearing from you and figuring out a schedule for the upcoming academic year. Okay. Take care. Have a good month.
CLIENT: Yes. You too.
THERAPIST: Okay. Take care.
