DESCRIPTION: Client discusses breaking up with her boyfriend and the mixed messages she is receiving after this breakup. Client discusses her current living and working situation, and how she needs to get out of it soon.
CLIENT: So I'm going to try not to cry the whole session. But Kevin (sp?) and I broke up over the weekend. (pause) We talked Thursday night. (inaudible at 00:00:23) talked Thursday night and he just... I had said that he was really angry and stuff over the last week or so. And I kind of said something ","P1-N4000B1":"to him and we started to talk a little bit Thursday night. And I just said, "I don't think it's really fair that you're kind of being nasty and sort of yelling at me and being defensive and passive aggressive these past few days." [00:00:59]
THERAPIST: What's the connection between...? I know you've been unhappy there for a while but in terms of breaking up with Kevin (sp?) and being there?
CLIENT: I think just being... everything happened... that everything that happened on December 30th the whole fight situation I mean, it happened there. [00:09:09] And I just... every time I'm in the house, I'm just constantly reminded of it. And I feel much more lonely when I'm there because I'm ","P1-N400231":"just upstairs on the third floor. And I have my own bathroom and my own bedroom and my TV and that's great. But then I just feel so isolated up there. And I don't really want to come down on the weekends or after they come home from work, all I want to do is just go upstairs and not talk to them or ","P1-N400232":"leave. And go talk to anybody else in the world. Like just talk to some random person on the street over feeling like I want to be there and talk to them. And I was trying to explain that to Miranda (sp?) last night because I had gone with them to a party. And she was like, "What is it about them that ","P1-N400233":"you just don't feel comfortable?" [00:10:04]
THERAPIST: It sounds like you feel trapped.
CLIENT: I do. And I don't know if a part of me feels even more trapped because I tried in September to say to them, "I need to move back to Pennsylvania. I need to go back to work and get a full-time job. Finish getting my certification. I've worked really hard at getting my degree. I have that and ","P1-N4002D1":"I'm living in your was not, even remotely, was never on my scope of things to do in my life. And I know things happen and it just happened that way. But I want to go back to work and sort of feel like I'm being a productive member of society. [00:14:01]
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you're starting to resent it.
CLIENT: Yea, a little bit. And I'm sort of just looking for any way to not be around them. And I don't want to have to go upstairs and sit in my room and watch TV and do nothing from 6:30 at night until I go to sleep, if I ever. I don't have very good sleep patterns as it is. So I'm just sort of sitting ","P1-N400331":"up there. And I don't like it. When my mind isn't occupied and I have people to talk to or something, I feel better. But I don't even want to occupy my mind by just talking to them which bothers me. And not knowing why sort of bothers me even more. [00:16:01]
THERAPIST: This is what you were feeling last week. Feeling like he was giving you mixed messages and even in the context of breaking up with you...
CLIENT: Yea.
THERAPIST: ...you feel like he's continuing to give you mixed messages.
CLIENT: Yea, I still feel like he just is so confused and that he just has no idea. And he... at this moment right now, he feels like us being... not being together, he keeps saying it's too much for him. And he can't... he doesn't feel like if we're still in a relationship, he used... he said, "I don't ","P1-N400591":"care if you went far away and we couldn't even talk for a year but the fact that just knowing that we're still in a relationship just the conflict, the idea isn't help me get over what's happening." [00:30:13]
THERAPIST: Can I ask you when you said that... the first thing you said today was, "I'm going to try not to cry." Why? [00:32:02]
CLIENT: Because I feel like I've been crying so much since it happened and I just... I don't know. It's not that I don't want to but I just... I think crying doesn't really make it any better. Doesn't make it... I don't know. I just... I go through sort of spurts where I'm OK and I can just talk and ","P1-N400611":"sort of just deal with it. But then I could just start crying for out of the blue and usually... like yesterday morning or this morning, the mornings are always really hard. Because I just wake up and my mind is going and I'm thinking about stuff and still trying to process it. And just really being ","P1-N400612":"sad but I don't know. [00:33:04]
THERAPIST: You don't want to get your hopes up.
CLIENT: Yea. I don't want to sort of feel like she will be able to help me in any way, shape or form because she's done nothing but... I can't say that I can... I'm blaming her for being sort of in this situation. But at the same time, it's like if I was never scared to talk to people or if I didn't ","P1-N4006F1":"feel so insecure about everything because of the things that she's done then maybe I wouldn't necessarily be in this predicament.
THERAPIST: It sounds like an interesting parenthetical. You're like, "Do what normal twenty somethings do." And then you sort of talk about why you feel you're not a normal twenty something.
CLIENT: Yea. I guess I just always had an idea in my head as to how my life would be right now. And I didn't really necessarily picture myself being a nanny and being incredibly unhappy and making sort of poor decisions about relationships. I always assumed that when I had met my boyfriend in Pennsylvania ","P1-N400791":"and we were together for five years and everything was fine, I sort of feel like when I made the decision to not be with him anymore is when my life just sort of feels like it started to fall apart. [0:41:21]
THERAPIST: That's quite a strong statement.
CLIENT: I just... I mean, I know that not necessarily... like things between him and I were sort of... they weren't perfect and we weren't exceptionally happy but I didn't really do anything about it. I just sort of moved on to the next person who paid attention to me. And then there was just lies and ","P1-N400811":"all kinds of stuff from there. And I was totally becoming a person that I'm not. And I feel like hurt him a lot and I was lying to him and doing all this stuff. And living back and forth with him and just torturing him. [00:44:00]
THERAPIST: Well, I was going to say we need to stop in a moment. I was going to say I guess this. As you know, I want to help you process all the bad feelings, too. And not just sort of look on the bright side but it does seem like it could be an opportunity as well.
CLIENT: Yea. I'm... hopefully I feel like maybe in the next few months I can sort of figure it out and become a much more independent person.
THERAPIST: Very good. I... talking, I know you're talking a lot about money issues. I just wanted to make sure you got my statement, too.
CLIENT: I did not so...
THERAPIST: Oh, I mean, that was weird. OK. I will e-mail it to you again. [00:48:08]
CLIENT: Did you e-mail it?
THERAPIST: I thought I e-mailed it to you.
CLIENT: I didn't get anything via e-mail so...
THERAPIST: OK. I'll e-mail it to you again. Maybe I forgot or maybe I don't... no big deal.
CLIENT: OK.
THERAPIST: But I was thinking about that because I thinking about it in the context of me e-mailing you the statement from last week, too, and the issue of money but...
CLIENT: Oh yes, OK. And I was sort of thinking like maybe I might only be able to financially afford to come once a week instead of coming twice a week because Kevin (sp?) was sort of paying for me to come that extra day a week. And now that's not exactly going to happen anymore so...
THERAPIST: Well, and I appreciate that. Do you want to come Thursday and then we can talk about it? Or what were you thinking?
CLIENT: Yea. I mean, I think Thursday I can come and then maybe we can figure out what day is better.
THERAPIST: OK. OK.
CLIENT: Does that sound all right with you?
THERAPIST: Yea, let's... we'll take on that more.
CLIENT: OK. I don't want to leave you hanging but...
THERAPIST: No, that's OK. [00:49:02] Let... I'll see if we...
CLIENT: I can't be more stressed out.
THERAPIST: No, I know, I know. Well, let's talk about it more on Thursday.
CLIENT: All right. Thank you.
THERAPIST: I'll resend that, too.
CLIENT: Oh, good. Thank you.
THERAPIST: Take care.
