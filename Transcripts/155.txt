TITLE: Client "S" Therapy Session Audio Recording, June 26, 2012: Client wishes her mother would be more proactive in trying to take care of herself and not rely as much on her daughter. Client is afraid that she is not a nice person and thus does not deserve nice things.
DESCRIPTION: Client wishes her mother would be more proactive in trying to take care of herself and not rely as much on her daughter. Client is afraid that she is not a nice person and thus does not deserve nice things.
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in.
CLIENT: So... (LAUGHTER) This week I just have been taking care of stuff so I can leave. I've been looking for places for my mom. So it's a little stressful, I guess just because... Well, first of all, she's like, "Yeah, you have to do this before you leave because once you're gone, I won't be able ","P1-N4000D1":"to do it." I was just like, "Wait. Why?" (LAUGHTER) [00:01:03]
CLIENT: I don't know. I just wish she would wake up a little and deal with stuff. Just... She just doesn't want to deal with things that bother her too much. Like I was just thinking as I was walking here that, you know, instead of watching all those soaps that she watches like (inaudible at 00:03:29) ","P1-N400151":"she could just like snap out of it and be like, "Maybe I'll clean the house or, you know, maybe I'll learn driving again so that it helps my daughter a little." (LAUGHTER) You know? It's just like... I mean, she can take care of... She can go by herself, travel by herself and take the bus and the train. ","P1-N400152":"She's good about that. But, you know, I still help her when she has to go to far off places. I mean, it could just be nice for me in the sense that like so I have to go to Union Station and, you know, I have to take a cab. You know? [00:04:07]
THERAPIST: A refuge from what? [00:07:55]
CLIENT: From the madness that's my place. (LAUGHTER) My goodness. It's like terrible. If I think, it I dwell on it too much, it's like... My mom's stuff is everywhere. It's worse now because Chris's dumped his stuff as well because his place doesn't free up until end of August. So... (SIGH) It's a mess. ","P1-N400211":"(LAUGHTER) And I just... I mean, I just hate the way that she... Her things just bother me a lot, like a lot. (LAUGHTER) Like she has this penchant for yard sales and she'll just like... It's like honey and a bee. She will always notice yard sale posters and always go and get crap, you know, like and ","P1-N400212":"then bring it home. (LAUGHTER) It just... And this is after I have taken her to designer showrooms and bought her really expensive clothes. They're just like somewhere in the bottom of her closet. [000:09:03]
THERAPIST: As compared to yours? [00:13:53]
CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) But...
THERAPIST: Did your parents fight often?
CLIENT: Well, when my dad used, when my dad was around, yeah, I guess. They'd fight as in like... I don't remember lots and lots of verbal arguments or anything. It was just a lot of tension because my dad would come back and he would be nice and he would just go away and there would be all these new ","P1-N400351":"affairs and whatnot. So... And my mom would scream at me and I would scream at her. I don't really... No, I take that back. He yelled a lot. He was mad... He definitely like was mad at me and he would beat me and stuff. So that of course was there. Yeah. I'm sure my parents fought. (LAUGHTER) [00:14:59]
THERAPIST: How did he beat you?
CLIENT: Well, he just... He was a boxer when he was in college. I didn't even make the connection. I'm only making the connection when I'm telling you. Like, yeah, he would beat me and I would bleed and he was like, "Yeah." Because he was a boxer. Like, "Oh yeah. So that make sense." He had these really, ","P1-N400391":"really, really thick hands. So, just, slapped and whatnot.
THERAPIST: Would he punch you?
CLIENT: No. I don't... Punched... Just lot of like... He would hold me by my hair and pull my hair and just like... I don't know. (LAUGHTER) My ears would bleed, I think. I don't know why. So... Whatever. But...
THERAPIST: Where would your mom be?
CLIENT: Sometimes she would try to intercept, you know, like stop him. But she wasn't as powerful as he was. So...
CLIENT: But I mean, like it's... I guess it's part of childhood. Children get beaten up. So...
THERAPIST: Is it more... Not here as much.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: In Nepal is it more common?
CLIENT: In school, yeah. In school it's more common. But that's... I mean to say, that's what I find the most different here. Here you have absolutely no... You cannot touch. You can't even touch your students. But there, yeah, like principals would really, really beat a student. So... Yeah. I didn't ","P1-N4004D1":"get beaten by teachers but my dad, yeah. So... (PAUSE) I mean, I guess I did stuff that made him mad. [00:17:01]
THERAPIST: How so? How do you feel like you come across as a not nice person?
CLIENT: I don't know. I feel like I'm judgmental. I feel superior or inferior, either superior or inferior. Those are the two extremes. I cannot relate to people as equals. [00:20:01]
THERAPIST: Why did they hate you?
CLIENT: I don't know. I feel like there was a lot of just jealousy and competition. Plus, from my side, I was just... I didn't really get to know them. I didn't really invest in getting to know them. I don't know why. (PAUSE) So... I asked Graham (ph) if I could stay with him. I had asked him earlier ","P1-N4005D1":"and he said, "Yes. Absolutely." (LAUGHTER) But that was before things got bad. So, I mean, he said no. I sent him an e-mail asking. I sent him like three e-mails. He didn't respond and then... This was about in general stuff and I was like, "Can I stay with you the Fourth of July because my flight is ","P1-N4005D2":"on the fifth from Ohio?" And he was like, "You'll have to find some other arrangement." (LAUGHTER) So I just was like, "Thank you for letting me know and just so you know, anytime you're in D.C. and you need a place to stay, you're welcome in my new place." (LAUGHTER) [00:22:05]
THERAPIST: Because?
CLIENT: Because I was nasty with Graham. So... (SIGH)
THERAPIST: It seems like you're very afraid that you push people away.
CLIENT: Yeah. I... Yeah. I mean, I'm really... I'm not... I'm very, very awkward socially. I don't know the right thing to say and I'm really afraid of... There's all these complexes like I didn't grow up in this country so half, most of the things you're talking about, I'm not going to get. You know? ","P1-N4006B1":"(LAUGHTER) But... So what else do I have to bring to the table? I don't really think much because I don't watch TV that much and, you know, my interests are so peculiar. I like literature and, you know, a little bit of cooking and... Yeah. What can I contribute to... I mean, not in every scenario. I ","P1-N4006B2":"can't expect to contribute to every single scenario. [00:25:03]
THERAPIST: Yeah. I'm not sure what "not nice" means.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What does it mean?
CLIENT: Being bitchy? I don't know. (LAUGHTER) I don't know what that means. Well, I guess just being judgmental and... When you don't like someone, you don't really... I don't know why I don't like people, some people.
CLIENT: And that's what I feel like people like Victor and Graham pick up and then they push me away. (LAUGHTER) Like I focus on the negative too much maybe instead of focusing on the positive. (PAUSE) I don't know. A while ago, like when I was in ninth grade, I made friends with... I just moved to ","P1-N4007B1":"Istanbul in eighth grade and I didn't really have that many friends because it was a new school for me and I just acted really superior with everyone just because I had already studied all that they were studying like in fifth standard so I was pretty bored most of the time. But in ninth grade, I managed ","P1-N4007B2":"to make friends with these girls that I thought were really fabulous, that they were modern, they spoke in English and they had boyfriends and they were... They respected their parents but they were a little classier than these other girls who were really traditional and they just hung out together ","P1-N4007B3":"and didn't have boyfriends and looked and dressed a little bit more conservatively, you know? So, I mean, I loved these girls. I was so happy to able to like hang with them and my hanging out time was so limited because my dad never allowed me to step out of the house. I always had to sneak out. (LAUGHTER) ","P1-N4007B4":"Always. And we didn't hang out that often. Like maybe we hung out like five times during that year. But those were fabulous times for me just because I did not get to interact with children my age at all. You know? [00:28:03]
THERAPIST: Do you feel like the nice things that people have, you could never create for yourself?
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Well, it seems like in order to have nice things, it seems like you need to be... You want to be a part of other people's nice things. But it doesn't seem like you could create a nice life for yourself. [00:30:09]
CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe...
THERAPIST: You could join someone else's nice life maybe.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right because that's what I feel with Chris because... That's why I feel maybe he's right for me because he... You know, like Victor said, "He's right for you because..." And he shoves things under the carpet and he's like, "Okay, so you've had a messed up life. Big ","P1-N4008B1":"deal. People have messed up lives. Shove it aside and let's do something useful with the rest of your life. You know? Let's join a movement. Let's contribute our talents to, you know, to politics. You know? Be active. Advocate on other people's behalf." That seems to me to make sense because, you know, ","P1-N4008B2":"people with emotional baggages like me... [00:31:07]
THERAPIST: No. Actually I wasn't thinking about that although it's interesting. I meant like just a nice life, nice things, like the way you see Victor's life, like nice things and something pretty, serene maybe.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Something that people would want.
CLIENT: I don't know how to create that. (LAUGHTER) I don't know. Is it... Can you buy it from stores? I mean, I'd buy it. But I don't think I can be... I don't think I have it in me to be serene. You know? (LAUGHTER) [00:32:03]
THERAPIST: Yeah. Although that's interesting that you... It seems like inside your home...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...your mother and what she represents... It's messy. It's dirty. It's not a place you want to be most of the time and it's not a place you feel anyone else could want. And then there's Victor and what he represents, a pretty life, beautiful space, beautiful scenery.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it seems like it feels so far away from you...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...and anything you could possibly have.
CLIENT: Yeah. I do something similar as my mom. I just... I mean, my room isn't that messy but it could be a lot better. It could be a lot nicer. [00:34:05]
THERAPIST: Typical?
CLIENT: Well, yeah, like that's kind of what I feel like happens to a lot of my friendships. Not a lot. I don't have a lot of friends. But I just feel like metaphorically that, you know... I fear that's what's going to happen. People will just toss me out of their home. You know?
THERAPIST: You feel like there's something ugly inside of you.
CLIENT: I guess. I mean... (PAUSE) Yeah.
THERAPIST: Distasteful. at the least very messy.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't really know how to make it pretty. [00:38:07]
THERAPIST: That's a big part of the problem. You're feeling that you couldn't.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Or not even that you couldn't but there aren't pretty things inside of you.
CLIENT: Yeah and that's the reason I have failed in my work because maybe I'm not generous with myself. I mean, I see the good in people but maybe it's just like cerebrally I see it but not... I don't feel it and I don't like appreciate it. So... I know I don't like me. I mean, that's kind of what it is. [00:39:03]
THERAPIST: But you feel that there's something missing.
CLIENT: With him?
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: Well, yeah, there's the whole physical thing and thinking of him as just a brother and yet our friendship is still there. It's withstood all these stupid things. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: And also you've always wanted a brother. You created a brother in your mind.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: We were talking about that last time.
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah. [00:39:59]
THERAPIST: You've had... This is sort of a strange way to put it. But you've had multiple opportunities throughout your childhood to feel badly.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I think you very much internalized your mother saying that you weren't wanted. Not only were you not wanted but you ruined her life.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Well, she still says it. I don't think she'll stop saying it. (LAUGHTER) As she gets older it'll just keep on coming.
THERAPIST: And you very deeply internalized that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean, how could you not. In some ways, how can you not?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, I do distance myself. I guess that's what Victor was trying to tell me was that... He was taking the more scientific route that, you know, we're so much bigger than all this, than our relationships with our parents. [00:42:05]
THERAPIST: It sounds like he has a lot of problems of his own.
CLIENT: He does?
THERAPIST: You don't think so?
CLIENT: Sadly, I'm so in love with him that I don't see the problems. I mean, I do see it. I think it's immature of him to be polygamous at his age. Is that what you mean?
THERAPIST: Sure and this dynamic that he's really investing in and bringing you in and pushing you out and bringing you in and pushing you out. I don't know what he's replaying from his own childhood but... (LAUGHTER) ...he's certainly not over it. He's certainly in it.
CLIENT: Yeah. What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Well, he's doing something that he's not, you know, that I imagine... I don't like to psychoanalyze people I've never met.
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:43:07]
THERAPIST: But clearly there's something he's struggling with and that he's doing that, you know, there's no sense of it on a logical level so there's something inside that he's struggling with.
CLIENT: Well, maybe it's the guilt that I'm Chris's girlfriend and... I mean, he said it himself. He's like, when he's not confused, he wants me to live with him and that we'll have two cats and, you know, all that. But he's confused and what he's confused about he said he does not like the negative ","P1-N401011":"streak in me. He says he doesn't' want to be in a relationship in which, yeah, he has to do a lot of work. He said he's been hurt before actually by the same person who also slept with Chris first and then slept with him. So I'm like following in her footsteps. [00:44:05]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:45:43)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So let me just double check the schedule for tomorrow. I think we said...
CLIENT: Nine.
THERAPIST: Did we say nine?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. I...
THERAPIST: For some reason my schedule was (inaudible at 00:46:05) Okay. So yep. Got it. Nine.
CLIENT: Yeah. So next week is 10:10 on Monday.
THERAPIST: Monday and then Tuesday at 10?
CLIENT: 10:45
THERAPIST: Oh 10:45. You're right. And then you're off to Nepal for a month. Right?
CLIENT: What should we do? Like should we Skype or... (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Would you like to do that?
CLIENT: Well, it might be strange in the sense that we're nine and a half hours ahead over there. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: So just logistically.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Well, let's just... So then it would be... Well, something in the evening for you...
CLIENT: Oh yeah. That's true.
THERAPIST: ...would be the morning. So that would probably be fine actually.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So let's talk about that next time. I'd be happy to do that.
CLIENT: Oh okay.
THERAPIST: I'm not very good with Skype but... [00:46:59]
CLIENT: Yeah but we can do like once a week or once two weeks or something because, you know, the connection might not be that good. But we can try it one time and see if it works.
THERAPIST: See if it works. Okay. Sounds good. So I'll see you tomorrow.
CLIENT: Okay. Thank you very much.
THERAPIST: Bye bye. (PAUSE) Bye.
