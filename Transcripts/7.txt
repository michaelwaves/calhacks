DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the stress he feels about his upcoming dissertation defense and the state of his marriage. Client discusses his first couples therapy session.
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: Good morning!
THERAPIST: Morning!
CLIENT: Changed the routine!
THERAPIST: I did?
CLIENT: Yeah, you said I could go on in. That's very definite!
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: (pause) So I'm having a rough time, I think. You know, my marriage is about at the same place it's been, which isn't great but, you know, isn't a change. (pause) I'm supposed to defend my dissertation in eight weeks. But I feel like one of the large pieces of it is unravelling, which is... just ","P1-N4001B1":"very frustrating. And... [00:03:12]
THERAPIST: Will it hold up, will it postpone when you defend, or will it just be not what you wanted it to be?
CLIENT: I think only the latter, but that's... (pause) But I think it's sort of an entangled question, rather like... (pause) Yeah, I guess I don't think this piece is essential to defending, so if I just let it go, I can continue on with the other work. But I feel like, it's one of those problems that ","P1-N400251":"I always feel like I have... I feel like there is a solution to it that I could access, if I could just figure out what piece of information I was missing. But the...
THERAPIST: (pause) Well, I think you're talking also about your marriage and your life. [00:11:26]
CLIENT: (heavy sigh) Um... That seems likely, but I wasn't thinking about it, like at the front, in the last thing that I said. I have certainly felt... the analogy other times, but...
THERAPIST: (pause) Well, the way I thought of it is, you have these questions. What you said before, about this piece of your dissertation, and I asked whether it would postpone getting done or it would get done, but just would leave something out. And to me, that seemed very analogous (client chuckles) ","P1-N400331":"and like, is this necessary or is it just, would it feel good to have sort of this piece figured out that is not, probably won't be figured out. And then this issue of wanting, not wanting constraints, the constraints that you have on some of the questions, to be able to respond to them or answer them ","P1-N400332":"in a good enough way, or satisfying enough way. [00:12:47]
CLIENT: Yeah, I think that's definitely true. (pause) So I spent many hours yesterday dealing with a computer glitch where it like... this has nothing to do with my thesis, just every time my computer tries to make a secure connection, it dials a remote server in the middle of Texas (I don't know why), ","P1-N400351":"and then doesn't get a response. So it hangs up for a while, so everything is just bogged down, which again, sounds kind of analogous. It can point to what's happening, but I can't fix it and invested a lot of time, know what's happening, but still keeps bogging things down. [00:13:40]
THERAPIST: You're very frustrated in a lot of areas of your life, because things are not going the way you want them to go, and the way you worked toward them going. (client affirms) And then, I guess, one question that you're faced with is, "What do you do about that, then?"
CLIENT: Right, right. And certainly my (chuckling)... a lot of my normal response is, "Well, work harder! That will fix it!" Because that often does fix it.
THERAPIST: Well, it may fix it, if you frame the problem corr , in the right way.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think there is a real gem of truth in that, but I think that part of it is that the longer you work on a problem, the more likely you are to frame it in the correct way, if you keep changing the way you frame it. Of course, if you frame it the same way and just keep working on it, that ","P1-N400451":"way you're never going to get to the right way unless that was right the first time, so...
THERAPIST: Well, you said that you weren't doing well. Are you talking about the things that are upsetting you? (inaudible) (blocked)
CLIENT: I think so.
THERAPIST: No, I just wanted to make sure it was (client affirms) (inaudible) (blocked) association. [00:17:00]
CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like I've led with the thing that I feel most upset about, whether that's actually the thing that's contributing the most or not, I don't know, but I think it is. (pause) At least to my immediate frustration, or something, so...
THERAPIST: You mentioned last week that you were frustrated with Dr. Jannis, well at least, on a couple of points, and that you were going to meet with him and I was wondering how that went.
CLIENT: That went well, actually. It went very well. (pause) I sort of expressed to him how I... how I was hearing the particular things he had said, what I felt like I was hearing. He just sort of said that that was not what he meant to be conveyed. You know, that's an interesting conversation to have. ","P1-N400531":"(therapist affirms) It went fine. [00:19:03]
THERAPIST: And when you say in light of, then how do you sort of think he's thinking, or how do you think about, you know, what is that thought, I mean, that thought process? Because that implies a certain kind of meaning to what's going on with you and Tanya now.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (pause) Right. So, I sort of feel like she... you know, just quit on me and that has broken most of the trust that I had (which, again, we've talked about a lot). But he interprets in some sense, in light of having been a part of this religious organization and having large breach ","P1-N400591":"of trust there. (pause) Yeah, I guess I don't have a clear sense of what that... what that means, other than like, he... (pause) Sorry, I'm not sure I'm answering the question. [00:21:39]
THERAPIST: You're doing fine.
CLIENT: Okay. (pause) Yeah, I guess I said that our marriage was in the same place, but that might not actually be true. It seemed true when I said it, but that might not actually be true. I guess I feel like Tanya is getting worse again. I don't know that that's true, and...
THERAPIST: (pause) What makes you feel that?
CLIENT: I feel like she's had... more bad days... per week in the last few weeks than she was a few weeks before. (pause) I don't know what confidence level to attach to that. I... So, I guess... yeah, but... (pause)
THERAPIST: But it sounds pretty intense. (client affirms) (pause) Do you connect with her unhappiness? Does it resonate with you?
CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) I think I definitely used to, in some sense, like... (pause) Yeah.
THERAPIST: Used to...?
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I think in some sense, it used to resonate with me.
THERAPIST: And then what changed?
CLIENT: We got outside of my frequency range, with which I could resonate. We've moved to... She was really, really bad.
THERAPIST: (pause) So what changed is the intensity of her unhappiness, and then you could no longer relate.
CLIENT: I think so? Maybe not just intensity, maybe kind also. (therapist affirms) At least that's the way I talk about it, but maybe they're the same. You know, maybe it's just, it was an intensity that I couldn't relate to.
THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?
CLIENT: Um... I was thinking about this being an interesting line that I don't think we've touched on in this particular way before; or at least I don't, it doesn't feel very familiar, but it's interesting. So I was thinking about is there, is there anything else involved in it? I don't know. You know, ","P1-N400851":"maybe I'm afraid that if I do get back in resonance with her, I will stay in resonance when it gets worse; I don't know. Like it, it's hard, it's painful to... to be there and, it's just, it's... bad a lot of the time for her, so... [00:30:31]
THERAPIST: In my mind, I agree that this isn't, most certainly for me, as formulated it, it's more formulated now than it is in the past, this particular line of thinking. That wasn't where my mind went. It went more kind of a differential (chuckles), sort of a differential diagnostic question, to put ","P1-N400871":"it really very, kind of crudely. But my first thought is, or one of the things I've been thinking about is, one of the ways you described being drawn to Tanya (or the two of you being drawn to each other), which is sort of a kind of disappointment or disillusionment with academia and maybe other things. ","P1-N400872":"But certainly this joint experience about, in a sense being unhappy (chuckles), not globally, but in particular areas and understanding that about each other. Then just the thinking about that as the beginning point, sort of understanding then how your relationship unfolded from that point. [00:31:35]
CLIENT: That is a very interesting suggestion.
THERAPIST: This is a bizarre analogy; I'm not sure if this is going to work, but it keeps coming to my mind. (client affirms) I use the analogy, it's like, you know, the two of you like to drink, you know, or smoke pot or something. You know, it was kind of an escape from things, it felt good and it ","P1-N400931":"didn't cause any harm. But then, one of you went over the edge.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know if it's going to work either, but it's interesting.
THERAPIST: I'm sorry; what's...?
CLIENT: That it's true, that the third point is not that big a deal. (pause) I feel like you've also been suggesting that perhaps I would be happier if I interacted with the world a little differently than I do.
THERAPIST: Yes! Yes, and probably happier ultimately, but less frustrated. (pause) This isn't quite the description I'm looking for, and I hope it's okay, but like a little brooding.
CLIENT: Yeah, that's probably fair. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: The alcohol or pot analogy I came to, came by, is like, there is something, you know, a little indulgent almost about, you know, sitting around and saying the world sucks. It's a little indulgent, and it can be kind of fun! Just be like, "This person sucks, and this person sucks. This is ","P1-N400A71":"supposed to be a great school, and now it sucks." And it's actually, can feel kind of good, and it's a little, you know, a little bit of that, you know, could bring people together and it's a little indulgent, but, you know... But then you overdose on that. (client chuckles) And you generalize to, "Life ","P1-N400A72":"sucks and everything sucks" and the whole thing just... Then that's a problem. I'm not necessarily saying that was Tanya's, you know, from A to B kind of thing, but just, you know, the, it's not a perfectly coordinated metaphor.
CLIENT: Yeah, and that's fine.
THERAPIST: For sure.
CLIENT: I think it's kind of interesting that I keep, I sort of keep pointing to that piece, like the "Are we drinking?" or "What does that part mean?" And you kind of keep pointing to the other piece of, "went too far."
THERAPIST: I'm not sure I follow what you just said.
CLIENT: Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I guess I said it in a lot of shorthand. Um, so I sort of keep, like, you know, the analogy is not exact, it's not like, it wasn't just an indulgent thing to like blow off some steam, but I mean, that's not the important point. You sort of keep coming to the other end of ","P1-N400B71":"the whole thing, of it went too far, as being... I think the central thing that the metaphor was trying to get at. That's all. I was pointing that out. I don't... I don't know quite what it means, that I keep looking at it, and then kind of looking back to. Well, but it's not an exact analogy, right? ","P1-N400B72":"So, instead of... because I guess, I don't know how to, I don't know how to grapple with that piece, or something. [00:41:51]
THERAPIST: Well, I guess a related piece is, there is something about Tanya's unhappiness that speaks to you and that you understand. And a piece of that is what brought you together. And, so the differential diagnostic part is, you know, try to understand how much of your unhappiness is because you're ","P1-N400B91":"in a situation right now, in your marriage right now, that, you know, would make many people deeply unhappy. Or how much of it also is sort of your own, that you bring to it. I know it's a very artificial distinction, but important nonetheless.
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I guess I feel some piece of both. Like, I get the unhappiness with the world, that we do. The suicidality I just don't get. (pause) We've talked about that before, sort of like it, I just don't get it. You know, when they were asking (ph) this sort of question of like I could ","P1-N400BF1":"probably come to understand it, but I'm not sure that I really want to, I'm not sure that's a particularly... healthy thing to come to understand. (therapist affirms) [00:44:08]
THERAPIST: Well you, you and Tanya understand about each other that, about not being lighthearted. I don't know what the, you know, the right description of not lighthearted is; serious, something... You don't take things lightly, neither does she. Maybe that's the sort of, the over, you know, you don't ","P1-N400C51":"take things lightly, but wait a second: she's really not taking things lightly.
CLIENT: (chuckles) That's an interesting way to describe it. I feel like that's become more true over time, I feel like we used to take at least some things lightly, I think. (pause) Yeah, I guess I used to really think we'd take some things too seriously, just as a, you know, as a culture, like that's ","P1-N400C71":"a problem, some people just take some things too seriously. Sure do seem to take things very seriously now.
THERAPIST: Yeah. You know what, we need to stop for today. (client affirms) Though, I never did touch base with Dr. Jannis yet, but I would like to this week. Is that still okay with you? (client affirms) That's great! Just wanted to check with you. Okay, I will see you next week! Okay, take care!
CLIENT: You, too.
