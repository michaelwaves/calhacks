DESCRIPTION: Client discusses his wife's depression and how it's having a negative impact on their relationship. Client feels as if he has to do double-duty in the relationship, and has difficulty trusting his wife once more.
CLIENT: Good morning.
THERAPIST: Good morning.
CLIENT: Do you know any therapists in Maryland?
THERAPIST: I do actually. I know someone who’s very good and I also have a pretty big network of colleagues here who will know some people there.
CLIENT: Okay. One of Tanya’s friends visited over the weekend. Her sister has just moved to Maryland and is struggling to find a therapist that works for her. [00:03:05]
THERAPIST: I know someone very good I’ve got but I’ve been in contact with them a couple of years ago. But I can I bet you I can dig up his name. I thought he was very good when I spoke with him.
CLIENT: Thanks. If it’s not too much trouble.
THERAPIST: It’s fine.
CLIENT: Thanks. So I felt like last week’s session was very helpful. So I’ve asked if you could prompt me more and keep (inaudible at 00:03:40). I really appreciate that. I felt much less like I was floundering.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: So thanks. I think you asked the question did I feel like I was floundering in my everyday life. I think I sort of said yes yes and no. The answer is probably more yes than no in some ways. But like this is an anchoring point in some sense. So, uh (pause) helpful to be here and particularly ","P1-N400211":"helpful last week so, thanks. [00:04:22] (pause)
THERAPIST: I’d be happy to do so.
CLIENT: Thanks. (pause) It’s sort of it occurs to me that I should probably talk out some of the features of the last week.
THERAPIST: When you say talked in that way, how do you mean?
CLIENT: Yes, that’s the right question but I don’t know how to answer it. [00:10:00] (pause)
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: You sit you might like sit and sort of talk about news events or talk about what’s going on or what you’re thinking about and progress through that to talk some about like what’s going on in your life. And sort of here’s a whole conversation that has many different ","P1-N400411":"parts that are not really related but in some ways like form the whole thing. Is that a am I describing an experience you understand? [00:11:01]
THERAPIST: And so with Tanya that feels like moments of danger?
CLIENT: [Laughing] Sorry, I said it and I sort of [Laughing] saw you grab on to that one. [Laughing] I think you should and I understand why you would, but yes. [00:12:02]
THERAPIST: But this doesn’t come there are not intense moment of danger, implying that.
CLIENT: [Laughing] Yes, I know. Yes, so there are certain topics that like set Tanya off or that Tanya can’t talk about. Those feel dangerous to me because I don’t trust Tanya to handle her emotions. So I guess I don’t have trust that it’s going to be okay or that like.
THERAPIST: The sitting with it, the (inaudible at 00:14:09)?
CLIENT: No, no the last part, that I need to talk about something else.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Like this is going in a bad place for me personally. Can we move to something else?
THERAPIST: So modulating somehow or moderating?
CLIENT: Yes, yes, yes. (pause) Protecting herself also and expressing her needs at a time when they can be met still. In that same situation Tanya would not say anything until it was like until she was already overwhelmed by whatever negative feelings there were.
THERAPIST: It seems like you’re really important observation is interesting.
CLIENT: So I think that’s a large part of what I mean about like intense moments of danger,
THERAPIST: That she can’t take care of herself in that way?
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Then maybe at times going there is okay. But to not be able to not go there at times when there are other things you need to do, you know, or just sort of function in your day, you’ve got to wrap it up and move on.
CLIENT: Yes, yes. And when you’re exposed to situations where things like that are coming up or are going to come up, like some sense of being able to draw appropriate boundaries and say like I need to not go there right now, before you’re there. [00:16:03] (pause)
THERAPIST: Did you share that with him?
CLIENT: Oh yes, yes. Perhaps less politely than I would have liked. (pause)
THERAPIST: Can you tell me how that frustrated you? [00:20:00]
CLIENT: (pause) Yes, I guess I started the summary of the things that happened that week by saying that I did all the preparations for Candace to come visit. That takes time in addition to like spending some time with Candace, it took all weekend to sort of catch up on the things that I had not done ","P1-N4007D1":"while I was doing those things.
THERAPIST: Well let me make a running analogy which may not be helpful to you so, but I’ll give it a try. [00:22:15]
CLIENT: (pause) Yes, so let me let me make the analogy a little bit worse by stretching it more than it probably needs. [00:24:24]
THERAPIST: That’s actually a really I think that analogy I think that at least that analogy conveys to you what you’re feeling.
CLIENT: I felt like it was good at doing that at least. I’m glad that it worked. [00:25:03]
THERAPIST: Well but it’s the truth.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: And I have to believe that the truth is helpful somehow.
CLIENT: [Laughing]
THERAPIST: I’m serious.
CLIENT: (pause) Sorry, I wasn’t laughing to dismiss that. (pause)
THERAPIST: This sounds like such a simple statement. And perhaps, live in a way I don’t mean it at all, but ultimately you need to decide what you want and if you want this. And part of the problem with this is it’s not clear what this is. Is this how Tanya is always going to be? Is this ","P1-N400B51":"a very bad stage in her life that she will move on from at some point? Those are unknowns. And so that decision needs to be made with those unknowns because those are unknowns. [00:29:04]
CLIENT: (pause) You know that was strikingly direct. I appreciate it. (pause) Yes, I don’t know how to make that decision with what you think you know. [00:30:47]
THERAPIST: Well maybe another way of looking at it, which sounds like it’s missing a piece, but that sort of how Tanya will fare in the future. If you take that variable out and say what if that doesn’t matter that much? [00:37:15]
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: So sort of try to assess, based on your current investment, be very crude, you know, later outcome on current investment maybe is not a very good way to go.
CLIENT: Yes. (pause)
THERAPIST: And if that’s true that you will need to find a way to have that be more sustaining during these periods, meaning that, you know, your commitment to commitment answer that being your kind of moral code and value system, that sort of maintaining that; adhering to that, will need to sort ","P1-N400DB1":"of help you weather these more difficult periods. You know getting some satisfaction that you are adhering to that.
CLIENT: Hmm. (pause) Yes that I hadn’t thought about. (pause) [00:41:19]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:42:02) experience is something that’s confining and is limiting your options. That’s a very different thing than something that you’ve proactively committed to and that you feel fulfilled you feel good about fulfilling.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. (pause) Yes, I need to think about that a little bit more. I sort of feel like there are broader implications, but I can’t pull them all out right now. And I also feel like it’s a little bit my own thoughts on it are sort of distracting from the main point; if that ","P1-N400E51":"makes sense. (pause) [00:43:14]
THERAPIST: I’ll see you next week. [00:45:06]
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Take care.
