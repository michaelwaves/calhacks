DESCRIPTION: Client discusses feeling like an outsider at a recent party, because of her current socioeconomic status. Client discusses how this issues has plagued her since childhood.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:01:02)
THERAPIST: It's all right.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:01:04)
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:01:06), yeah.
CLIENT: [laughs]
CLIENT: I have a headache from running the (inaudible at 00:01:28). [laughs] I feel like going to bed. [laughs] I don't know why running gives me a headache, I have no idea. [laughs]
THERAPIST: You don't want to talk today?
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:03:43) [laughs] Yeah, so, nothing's really happened since Monday, but I was thinking about what you said, what we talked about Monday. [00:04:01]
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: [laughs] I'm just like, "I just want to sleep." [laughs] It's really terrible, the headaches. Well, it's not terrible, but it's like...I usually have to take a headache medicine right after running. [laughs] (inaudible at 00:04:28)
THERAPIST: Do you feel more comparative with Nepalese?
CLIENT: I guess. Yeah, because...I don't know; I mean, I kind of understand [it right now] (ph). I mean...yeah, I don't know why.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. I guess I'm just in this comparative mode. I'm tired of it [laughs] but...I guess I'm trying to figure out how to snap out of it, how to come out of it. [00:11:00]
THERAPIST: Not in the way we're talking about. If anything, that was sort of what I was talking about on Monday, in terms of what could happen for you but doesn't with other people.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, there was so many people with which it doesn't happen.
THERAPIST: Or even being-when you're out with Nelson (sp?) and feeling, rather than strength by association, you feel like an outsider. In a sense, what you're describing with this one friend, that you do feel strength by association, [in a sense] (ph), "If she can do it, I can do it." [00:12:04]
CLIENT: Yeah. I did. I felt weirdly strengthened. I don't know where it came from, [laughs] but it was there.
CLIENT: What do you mean, when out with Nelson, I feel like an outsider?
THERAPIST: You were describing, a couple times when you're talking about being at a party with him, being with his friends and feeling like an outsider rather than feeling like, "Oh, I'm with him. I've been invited by him."
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That's (inaudible at 00:13:46).
CLIENT: Yeah, that whole thing was so weird. I guess it happened once in a mild way, very early on. [00:14:00] It was the first time he'd taken me to one of his friend's place, and it was just this one guy.
THERAPIST: When you say, "I was," what are you referring to?
CLIENT: I mean at that Thanksgiving party, I was an outsider. [laughs]
THERAPIST: How are you defining it?
CLIENT: In the sense that [laughs] that's a circle and these people know each other for several years. That was the second or the third time they were meeting me. [laughs]
CLIENT: I don't know, at that party, it just felt like everyone was just...there to judge me and...because I was there as Nelson's date, I felt like (inaudible at 00:17:46) they were all like, "Oh, what is she all about?" and, "What does she do?" "She's poor," or whatever. "She doesn't have a corporate ","P1-N400891":"job," and, "She doesn't have a Ph. D. What is she doing?" [00:18:02]
CLIENT: And they were talking, I guess, amongst themselves, because then (ph) they knew each other well-not that they didn't talk to me, they were being just fine. They were being nice, actually. But I guess it was like they weren't going to talk to me and they were going to ignore me.
CLIENT: And it reminds me, it totally reminds me my previous experience with my childhood. [laughs] Of groups and cliques and a circle of friends, wanting desperately to be a part of them, to gain recognition and [sighs] attention. [00:20:05] But then being mistreated and being ignored. Then wanting ","P1-N400951":"to prove them that they're idiots for-I feel mad at them. [laughs]
THERAPIST: How much do you bring this experience into all your current experiences, where the context and the circumstances are so different?
CLIENT: I know, but I just don't understand why do I do that?
THERAPIST: It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
CLIENT: Yeah. Why does it work that way? [laughs]
CLIENT: I guess I was just got it into my head that I'm not good enough for these people, and maybe I'm not or these people as in certain people. I guess that's because of the competitive mode, I guess.
CLIENT: I feel like saying that, "Oh, but if they just accept me for who I am, then I'll be nice to them, always," but that's not true, because they do, at some point, in their own way, accept me for who I am, [laughs] so that's not the reason. [laughs] [00:27:00]
CLIENT: This whole power-by-association thing, it's good but I kind of take it with a grain of salt, because with Chris, that's what was supposed to happen and it did, for a bit. I felt smart, because he was smart.
CLIENT: I felt, at that point, a very profound sense of almost betrayal. There was no power-by-association, I just wanted to push that away because I was like, "What does this mean? [00:29:05] What is this power-by-association?"
THERAPIST: Sure, it's one version of it.
CLIENT: There's another version? [laughs]
THERAPIST: By him choosing you.
CLIENT: Oh, I don't like that. [laughs] What does that mean, "choosing" me? [laughs]
THERAPIST: When you're at a party and you feel like an outsider with his friends, but he was with (ph) you. You were associated with him. He brought you there.
CLIENT: Yeah, I hate that! What am I, a piece of vegetable or what? Am I a nice bag or something? I'm not an object.
THERAPIST: See, that's what that means to you, [that's where you mind goes] (ph).
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:32:50), that's so patriarchal.
THERAPIST: Yeah. That's certainly not what I meant, but it's interesting.
CLIENT: [laughs] [00:33:00] That's what it sounds like, to me. [laughs]
THERAPIST: It wasn't, "You should be so grateful that he chose you."
CLIENT: Yeah, that's what it sounds like. What should...
THERAPIST: Really?
CLIENT: ...I be?
THERAPIST: Well, when you go and you feel like an outsider, you feel unwanted. And so I'm pointing out that he is choosing you, he's wanting you...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...not that you should be so grateful, that you're actually the opposite of being unwanted. But then your mind goes to, "Oh, I'm not an object."
CLIENT: [laughs] Yeah. But I chose him, too.
THERAPIST: Yeah, but when you feel like an outsider, the issue is your feeling unwanted.
CLIENT: Yeah, I see that. I see, I see.
THERAPIST: I'm not saying there's a power differential. You're feeling the power differential. I'm simply saying I'm just focusing on one side of the equation...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...I'm not saying there isn't a whole equation (ph).
CLIENT: I see. Let me think about it that way, [laughs] see if I can, but no, I just don't want to. [laughs] (inaudible at 00:34:02) [laughs]
CLIENT: I feel like I'm letting go of my independence when I think that way, you know? [00:35:03]
CLIENT: Yeah, that's another silly equation. If someone does something nice for me, then I feel like I will go...I'll get soft and I won't struggle. [00:36:04]
THERAPIST: What do you mean? Denying what?
CLIENT: Maybe it's not denial; it's another word...lack? That narrative of lack, that I don't have things. Being chosen and being wanted is not part of that whole narrative.
THERAPIST: It isn't.
CLIENT: But we're trying to change that, right? [laughs] [00:38:00]
CLIENT: I'm kind of confused. I'm thinking about that party and thinking, "Did I yell at that woman because I felt like an outsider?" I don't think so, right? That's a separate issue. That's got more to do with my issues with her and the fact that I didn't resolve them in the right way or take care ","P1-N401331":"of them early on, not because I felt like an outsider, right? (inaudible at 00:40:34)
THERAPIST: What did she say to you?
CLIENT: Hmm?
THERAPIST: Oh, no, this is the woman who was supposed to do the interview.
CLIENT: Yeah. I was just wondering, did I-was I mean to her because I felt too much, too safe, too secure and too happy that I was there and that I was wanted and chosen? [laughs] [00:41:03] I feel like I did feel that, a little bit, but...
THERAPIST: You felt she had a stronger obligation to you than certainly she felt...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...and you felt betrayed.
CLIENT: Yeah, so that has nothing to do with feeling like an outsider.
THERAPIST: Not directly.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It makes me wonder, sometimes, in order to compensate for the feeling of being an outsider that you sort of assume a level of loyalty that hasn't been established.
CLIENT: Probably. Can you say more about that?
THERAPIST: I don't know. [laughs]
CLIENT: [laughs]
THERAPIST: It was just something that I was formulating.
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:42:00] Well, because I do that. I think that's what people mean when they tell me that friendships take time, and I'm like, "What? No, no, no, they don't."
CLIENT: Yeah, it kind of does go back to that experience in my childhood and not getting invited by this girl, of being treated like that by her. [laughs] It's funny. I didn't think it would affect me that much, but then going back to it and...yeah. [00:44:00]
CLIENT: [sighs]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:44:32), we're going to need to take this (inaudible at 00:44:34). I'll see you on Monday. Monday is Martin Luther King Day, I think, but I'm here.
CLIENT: Okay. (inaudible at 00:44:42)
THERAPIST: Okay, thank you. I appreciate you, too.
