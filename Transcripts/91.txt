DESCRIPTION: Client discusses leaving her job and moving to a new city during her last therapy session. Client discusses her hopes of finding a new therapist and continuing to work through her personal issues.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.
CLIENT: It's warm in here. So before... I just wanted to tell you that this will be my last session.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: We'll get into that, so... guess the last time I saw you was last Monday?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: I went to Pennsylvania this past weekend. And on Saturday I had gone to Ohio, and I was out with the friends that Kevin and I had made, the girl. And we were hanging out and just sitting there, and I got a text message from the people that I work for now. [0:01:03] And she texted me to tell ","P1-N400151":"me that I would be leaving next week, so next Thursday is my last day. And I am going back to Pennsylvania. I went on a job interview while I was there last weekend, and it seemed to go well. I talked to the director of the program, and then I just today talked to the supervisor and the human resources ","P1-N400152":"woman and kind of let them know that my availability has changed. Basically when I got back here on Monday, I didn't respond to her text message because I thought it was a little inappropriate to sort of text message someone at 9:00 at night to give them their two weeks' notice.
THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Yeah. [That's really] (ph) crazy. [0:02:03]
CLIENT: And there was no way that I would sort of respond to that at all. And so I got back on Monday right about dinner time, and they were just all sitting down to dinner. And I walked in, and the kids were so excited to see me, and they can't believe we (ph) were gone for so long because the little ","P1-N400191":"one exaggerates (chuckling). And they invited me to sit down for dinner, so I had dinner with them. And, you know, the only thing I wanted to do was go back and just... I didn't even want to talk to them because I was sort of so hurt and just disgusted at the idea that she obviously knew Saturday during ","P1-N400192":"the day. She also would have still known on Sunday during the day that, you know, the end of February was okay for them. And she could have just picked up the phone and called. Or she could have waited until I got back and, you know, did it in person. [0:02:58]
THERAPIST: Would you want to come next week? You don't want to come next week here?
CLIENT: I think I just need to kind of get all my stuff together and start packing. And I obligated to the other family to sort of do some extra hours with them because I kind of need the money now? I don't really have... and because I'm not getting help from Kevin to sort of offset certain things. ","P1-N4002F1":"[0:13:01] And I saw him over the weekend, and, you know, we hung out or whatever. And I explained to him, you know, what was going on. And, I don't know, he's just been sort of weird, and I think he sort of goes through... like, where if I do see him and then everything's great and fine and we have ","P1-N4002F2":"a good time together. And then the last few days he just acts weird, like, after I see him. So I try to just give him space and not really sort of butt in and talk to him all that much? Just given the circumstances.
THERAPIST: Well, one thing I wanted... I know it's a little bit of switching the topic, but I know... one of the reasons I asked about wanting to come in again is usually people take a session to talk about, you know, what the experience was like, what they've learned, and what they want to work on. ","P1-N4003B1":"[0:21:58] And, given it seems like we're not going to have the opportunity to do that, it could be a good idea to spend the rest of the time we do have together to talk about that a little if you'd like.
CLIENT: I guess I sort of feel like I would like to be able to continue coming and when I go to Pennsylvania to sort of find somewhere to go, and that I've had a more positive experience this time, rather than in previous times where I just didn't feel comfortable or something happened and I just didn't ","P1-N4003D1":"want to be there. And, you know, I feel like over the last I guess... it feels... I guess... I keep saying month, but it's almost the end of February already, so it's two months... that, you know, I've tried to really kind of do self-assessment and to try and kind of figure out the kind of person that ","P1-N4003D2":"I want to be and want to continue to be? [0:23:01] And, you know, I keep saying, I really want to be a better person, and I want to approach issues and conflict and people in a different way. And I'm absolutely trying to do that. I'm just sort of trying to continue to kind of keep working on how I am ","P1-N4003D3":"and kind of taking a step back before maybe I answer and thinking about stuff before I start to talk and kind of just continue to work on what is better for me.
THERAPIST: Well also, what part of Pennsylvania will you be in?
CLIENT: South, so, like, right outside of Philadelphia.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Not near York?
CLIENT: It's that far south, but it's all the way east. So York's on the central side of Pennsylvania, and then I live right by the city.
THERAPIST: Right, right, right. Well, I'll certainly... I mean, I have a pretty extensive network of colleagues. I don't know anyone specifically down there, but I can certainly look into that for you.
CLIENT: Okay, that would be great because I don't really... yeah, I don't really know many people in the area. I'm sure there are, and I definitely don't want to go to the same person that my mom goes to. And I don't want to revisit people that I have before because I didn't necessarily have good experiences ","P1-N4004B1":"with them, and...
THERAPIST: Well, I'll certainly... if you e-mail me that town or a couple surrounding towns, I... it'll be helpful for me to... I'll definitely get you some names. [0:25:57]
CLIENT: Okay, thank you. (Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: I'll be happy to do so. In terms of the patterns that you're worried about falling back into, are there a couple in particular that you'd like to, you know, continue working on?
CLIENT: Just, you know, sometimes lately I've been sort of going over in my head, and, you know, when I have six hours of driving, you kind of have time to think (chuckling). And just the things that I've sort of [necessarily said to... more so Kevin] (ph) in the last year. Just reacting in certain ","P1-N400531":"ways, and, you know, as I look back on them now I think, you know, how silly of... for me to sort of be mad about, you know, he bought a new car, and I didn't like it. And I kind of ruined the experience for him because I was like, oh, that's not exactly the car I thought you were going to get. Because ","P1-N400532":"he was looking at a whole bunch of them, and he ended up with a different one, and... you know, and I felt bad. And I was like, why would I even care that much? [0:27:01] I know, just because it wasn't the one that I wanted him to get, it doesn't matter? And, you know, I think it's so silly, and he ","P1-N400533":"remembers, you know. You really sort of pulled the rug out from under me because it was supposed to be something fun and exciting. And you kind of just weren't very pleasant about it. And it's like little stuff like that that, you know, are so stupid, and why does it matter, you know? He could have ","P1-N400534":"bought a car from the 1950s, and it shouldn't matter what it was.
THERAPIST: One thing I've been struck by in terms of your breaking up with Kevin is it's... you were very sort of frustrated and confused by his behavior. But I feel like I didn't... at least I didn't hear you between (ph)... express just, you know, grieving that loss.
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess maybe because part of it is, you know, he's still sort of around? But also trying to sort of keep things together as much as... I don't know, trying to keep it together and just sort of... it's been hard, and I haven't... and I don't understand sort of why things have developed ","P1-N4005B1":"the way that they are. [0:30:58] And, you know, part of me wants to think, well, as things change and everything is changed, then, you know, we can discuss getting back together. But then in the back of my head it's always there that, you know, he doesn't want to sort of have this relationship. And ","P1-N4005B2":"I've sort of started feeling angry towards him and sort of resentful that, you know, we can spend time together and everything is fine. And then he sort of asks distant and he's weird and he keeps saying how confused he is and how unhappy he is. And I feel like maybe a part of me is more mad at him ","P1-N4005B3":"for that rather than... you know, I'm mad mostly.
THERAPIST: It's really just another week.
CLIENT: Yeah, and, you know, I don't have to be there this weekend or anything. [0:34:58] And, you know, I already started to try and pack up some of my stuff and... as much as I took with me on this past weekend, I'm like, (chuckling) I don't know if all my stuff's going to fit in my car, so I'll try ","P1-N400631":"to jam it all in there and see what happens because I don't... obviously the option is not to leave it, then come back and get it. And I'm sure I could leave it at... the other people that I babysit for, they've offered, you know, if I wanted to leave stuff there. So I'll just sort of be juggling and ","P1-N400632":"trying to figure out and jamming things, and hopefully (chuckling) it all fits in there.
THERAPIST: Well, I know there's a lot of things about things about being here you did not like. Is there anything that you will miss?
CLIENT: I will miss the kids. You know, they're innocent in this whole situation whether their parents feel a certain way about me or not and whether I feel a certain way about being here any more. [0:39:59] But, you know, I'll miss the kids, and I'll miss the other family that I babysit for. And, you ","P1-N4006D1":"know, it is... it's a nice area, it's a great area. I'll miss food store (chuckling) because we don't have one close to where I live. And, you know, when I was there this weekend, I was sort of driving around, and I went to, you know, the nail salon that I used to go to and just sort of sitting there ","P1-N4006D2":"thinking, I really don't feel like I fit in around here any more. I sort of feel like I've outgrown this area because everything is just... it's just Pennsylvania. And, I don't know, to me it's just sort of, like, I don't know. I don't know if it's going to be a permanent move back. I'm not sure. I ","P1-N4006D3":"mean, I have to make the best of it while I can, and, you know, I do know the area, and that's fine, and all that stuff. [0:40:55] But a part of me feels like, just being there, I've sort of outgrown everything that's, you know, my life before I moved up here and, you know, being stuck there.
THERAPIST: Well Angela (sp?) we're going to need to stop.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: It was a pleasure working with you.
CLIENT: Thank you. I'm sorry it's been so short, and (chuckling)...
THERAPIST: I hope it was helpful for the time that we met.
CLIENT: It was, I appreciate it.
THERAPIST: I know it was a particularly stressful time and (inaudible at 43:47) transition.
CLIENT: Yes, and it will continue to be, but...
THERAPIST: It will continue to be, but, you know, please feel free to contact me if I can help in any way. Definitely e-mail me, you know, a couple of towns that will work best for you... [0:44:01]
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And I will definitely help you to find a therapist, and...
CLIENT: Great. Thank you very much.
THERAPIST: Sure. I guess logistically I'll send you a statement. I have your credit card, so...
CLIENT: Yeah, you can just bill that [if you want] (ph), and...
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Just try and get everything together next week. So that's fine if you just bill that.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay, well great. Best of luck to you, okay?
CLIENT: Thank you very much. Thank you.
THERAPIST: Okay, take care.
