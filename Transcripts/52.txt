DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the woman he is currently dating and their tumultuous dating past. Client discusses how he feels about the future, with marriage and settling down, and how he might not be ready to give up on travelling just yet.
THERAPIST: Okay great.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:00:11) between gym and work, yeah.
THERAPIST: Hi.
CLIENT: Hi. How are you?
THERAPIST: Good. Thank you.
CLIENT: It’s been a good week. I feel... (inaudible at 00:00:25) I feel like it was, it was like refreshing, you know? Like I left here and went home and processed a bunch of stuff and it was like, “Okay. I can see myself in some of these situations, you know, some of the terms that you ","P1-N400151":"said.” Like I think you said self-destructive was one of those. So yeah. That was good. I think it was like... You know, at some point over the weekend, I was up in Provincetown and I was like, “Yeah. It makes a good bit of sense.” [00:01:03]
THERAPIST: Does it help sort of organize like what’s... Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I think... I wouldn’t organize... I think it’s just nice to be able to put terms on things, you know, and be able to be like, “Oh, okay. This is a type of behavior that I have or this is what I was doing.” I don’t know. Something about that just made ","P1-N4001B1":"me feel like good, like it’s been a pretty good... Since I talked to you last, whatever, that was Thursday, I just feel like it’s been, like things have been going really well which is nice. I don’t know if that’s a correlation or a causality. It’s been good. So, yeah. ","P1-N4001B2":"I had a... You know, I had a really good conversation with my boss’s boss about my job. And, you know, I think I had mentioned that before where it’s just I’m in, I’m in a spot where I’m not necessarily doing, you know, what I want to be doing. [00:02:05]
THERAPIST: Not much?
CLIENT: Not much. No. She hasn’t like... I think we talked. We talked on Sunday for a little bit. And she was, you know, she out to get a new cell phone and she was going to text me after she got it and now it’s what, Wednesday afternoon, and I haven’t heard from her. (New York CityUGHTER) ","P1-N400291":"Presumably that went... Question mark? So, yeah, that was cool. It was actually nice just have a normal... I feel like if I don’t catch her before lunchtime, she’ll be drunk by the time I call her.
THERAPIST: Is she drinking a lot?
CLIENT: Oh yeah.
THERAPIST: Has she always had an alcohol problem or just since her breakdowns?
CLIENT: I probably notice it now because I’m more attuned to it. I think it’s always been there. It’s just now it’s more like when I was... Like last time I was at home, I went and I met her for lunch before we went to my grandparents’ barbeque. We were at lunch and she ","P1-N400311":"was like, “Another glass of wine, another glass of wine.” She had like three glasses of wine at lunch before we made it to my grandparents’ and then it was just knocking it back, you know, like... [00:08:09]
THERAPIST: Wow. For her.
CLIENT: Yeah. For her or for any other, you know, my grandparents as well. I mean, that’s a useful skill to have, I suppose. It’s served me well. I think I could open a wine bottle with a screwdriver if I had to. I don’t know if that’s a redeeming characteristic or not. It certainly ","P1-N400371":"helpful when you don’t have a wine opener.
THERAPIST: But it sounds like addiction runs in your family.
CLIENT: I would probably agree with that. I think that’s one of the reasons why I have the like... I actually... It was funny. On Thursday, I was actually lifting... I came back from here. I went to work for a while. And I went to lift with one of my buddies. [00:09:03]
THERAPIST: Like you had some control over your life and you can make directions.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It’s not like things happen to you and you do things that you regret later.
CLIENT: Yeah. It was nice. We’ll see. I don’t know. So, the whole regret thing... So I went to... I spent the night with... So, there’s Melanie (ph). Let’s set the cast of characters here. So there’s Melanie and I’ve been dating her on and off for probably over a ","P1-N400491":"year now. I met her at a bar in Falmouth (ph). She’s older than me. She was unemployed at the time. We were going really well and then I cheated on her and then we broke up and then we got back together and then we were, things were going really well and then we broke up and we got back together ","P1-N400492":"and then, most recently, she decided it would be a good idea on her birthday... We were drinking a lot. [00:12:19]
THERAPIST: Oh, that was her.
CLIENT: Yeah. That was her. So we were off and I thought we were actually done like for good there. So I started, you know, dating. It was probably a mistake because I don’t think I was ready for that. I don’t think I closed that chapter and then moved on and like reflected and learn from ","P1-N4004F1":"my past relationship. It was just sort of, “Alright. Let’s get on here and let’s go and get out there and start dating again,” because that’s... Like it feels like to me that helps me, I don’t want to say behave myself, but that keeps me in check more. So it’s ","P1-N4004F2":"like I see that out. [00:13:01]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:13:43)
CLIENT: No, it’s good. So then I met this other girl, Physician’s Assistant, really cute. I met her online and we went on a couple dates and like it went really, really well. And everything, I thought, was going really, really well and then, you know, and then my... [00:14:03]
THERAPIST: Huh.
CLIENT: Yeah, it’s an interesting trivia question for you. So things went really well with her. It was really like just easy. She was super chill. Like first girl I’ve ever dated who makes more money than me. She’s got her shit together. Things were going really well. We went to Provincetown ","P1-N4005B1":"and, you know, I realize that I’m still incredibly... [00:15:01]
THERAPIST: What did you do that she hit you? I forgot. You told me...
CLIENT: She was just pissed because it started out with she was pissed that she didn’t have a lot of room in my apartment. I live in a studio. So it’s not like there’s a lot of room to being with and she had like... She had a shelf in my bathroom. She had her toiletries, you know, ","P1-N400651":"all over in the shower. She had some space in my closet to hang stuff up and she had space for her shoes. So it was kind of like, “I don’t know how much more space I can give you. I don’t have... If I give you any more space, I’m getting rid of stuff that I wear once every twelve ","P1-N400652":"days. Like I can’t sacrifice a twelfth of my wardrobe for you to be able to have, you know, a little bit more convenience when you’re coming over to see me.” I didn’t say it like that. [00:18:15]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And I’m not going to say like... I’ve done some things that I’m not proud of. Like I’m not proud that I’ve cheated on Melanie. I never thought I’d be that type of person. But it happened. And I was certainly as willing a participant in it as the people I cheated ","P1-N4006B1":"on her with. You know? And I enjoyed it. I had fun and I did it in part, you know, because Melanie... I was in a nine year relationship before I met Melanie. [00:18:59]
THERAPIST: Or probably ever. But...
CLIENT: Yeah. It’s one of those things where it’s like you probably shouldn’t talk about your sexual past with anybody. So it came up enough times that it was like... I had been... At that time, I was still at Google and I had been working on this project where I had spent, you know, ","P1-N400711":"let’s say in a given... [00:20:11]
THERAPIST: This is interesting (inaudible at 00:26:15)
CLIENT: No. It’s not. Like I think emotionally, I have no issue with like marriage, family, kids, no problem. You know? Definitely having a number of kids greater than one. I don’t know. Maybe the upper bound on that’s like three. I’ve heard three is good because if you have ","P1-N400831":"two, they’ll all work together but if you have three, there’s always one who’s going to rat out the other two who are working together. It minimizes the mischief. So apparently you don’t... I guess three. So two or three. But like the whole, like, the whole settling down part ","P1-N400832":"of it is what doesn’t make me feel good. Like the house in the suburbs with like the picket fence and the minivan, like not my speed. [00:27:09]
THERAPIST: Is that synonymous with the settling down?
CLIENT: Well, I think that’s like the notion of settling down. That’s like the American idealized like, “Hey. I’m going to settled down...” I could get married and have kids and never own a house and just travel the world as jobs presented themselves in far-fetched places. ","P1-N400891":"And like I think that would be fine and I think that that’s maybe a little selfish for the kids. But I think that’s a pretty awesome experience. Like how many kids get to travel the world with their parents? But, yeah, like living in the city is important after, you know, like after I’m, ","P1-N400892":"I guess when I’m married or serious engagement type situation. [00:28:03]
THERAPIST: Are you not sure if some place will feel like home?
CLIENT: I read one time that the more places you see, the fewer places... The more places the see, the more things you like from each of them and the fewer places have everything that you’re looking for. So the more that you travel... []... And like the more of the world that you experience, the ","P1-N400931":"more, you know, sort of homogenized maybe? I don’t know. The more of the experiences that you get, you start to put, “Okay. I like this part of that and there’s no one place that will have all of that.” You know? Like I think back to some of my friends who never left the place ","P1-N400932":"that we grew up in. Like coming out to Providence is a huge deal for them. [00:30:55]
THERAPIST: Home. Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know. I don’t know what that would entail. Like I don’t know what home would be. You know, I don’t know how I would know if a place felt like home or not not because... I don’t know. Yeah. That’s actually a pretty deep question. That’s ","P1-N4009B1":"why you’re the therapist. (LAUGHTER) that’s clever. I don’t know. [00:33:01]
CLIENT: It felt... When I was first out in Portland, I lived in the suburbs. I lived sort of right by... There’s Portland, []. I lived out there when I first moved out there and like that probably felt like home. I was with Iris (ph) with my one girlfriend. We had a big two bedroom townhouse. ","P1-N400A11":"It had a table. It had a table. Way to go Luke (ph). You’re an adult now. It had a big table that sat like twelve. We did Thanksgiving and had a cat. Like that felt like home, I guess. [00:35:03]
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [00:36:57]
CLIENT: That’s not including the people who work at the industries around that support Google, all the contingent staff, the people, the catering companies etc. So the thirteen miles from [] would take two and a half hours. You know? If you have 8:30 dinner reservations, you better leave at five ","P1-N400A91":"and cross your fingers. You better stop drinking water at lunchtime in case you get stuck in traffic and you have to go to the bathroom. So it’s pretty bad. Essentially, your friends just sort of dispersed. And now it’s like you see each other at weddings and baby showers from time to time ","P1-N400A92":"or if somebody... There was a couple that are from... You know, somebody occasionally, if they’re in town from the Fourth of July or something you can see them for, you know, dinner. But it’s not like it was, you know... It’s this inseparable crew of people that is no more. So yeah. ","P1-N400A93":"So I guess that’s something that helps a place feel like really, really tight and like home. I guess that’s what I... Yeah. That’s kind of what I get from soccer. It’s a brotherhood in some respects. [00:38:01]
THERAPIST: So it’s a community.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, it’s also... For whatever reason, it attracts similar types of people. We’ve all kind of got this twisted sense of humor. Immature is probably the right word. [00:41:07]
THERAPIST: Well, a sense of belonging.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I was thinking... We’re going to need to stop in a moment but I was thinking that maybe one of the reasons you like sports so much is it helps you define what you’re looking for on like a lot of levels. I don’t know.
CLIENT: No. I think that’s probably true. I think there’s part of it that it’s... You know, you figure out what you want by experiencing what’s (inaudible at 00:43:51) What is it? Addition by subtraction, I guess.
THERAPIST: And what’s possible. I mean, that’s sort of almost the definition of exploring is learning about what’s possible. [00:43:59]
CLIENT: Yeah. I think you learn a lot about yourself, like what’s actually important. You know, like my patience... I didn’t have a lot of patience before I went to Japan and then it was like, “Hey, I’m in Japan. There’s twenty eight million people in my city. I don’t ","P1-N400C51":"speak a God damn lick of this language. I can’t read anything. Okay. (LAUGHTER) Cool. Let’s just relax because there’s going to be stuff that happens and stuff’s going to get messed up.” You know? But, yeah. I think that’s also... You kind of... You figure out like ","P1-N400C52":"what’s out of there but you also figure out more about yourself and what’s actually important. Like does it actually matter to be really high strung and wound up all the time? Probably not. (inaudible at 00:44:41) It gives you perspective on things like, “Hey, maybe it’s actually ","P1-N400C53":"not that bad what’s going on in my life because I’m here and, you know, not some subsistence farmer in the backwoods of Japan.” So, I mean, it’s very different to say that versus seeing it firsthand. [00:45:01]
THERAPIST: I can imagine. We are going to need to stop for today.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So I think I mentioned next week I’m away. But I have this time as a regular time if you’re interested in that.
CLIENT: Yeah. Let’s just do that.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: That makes sense for me.
THERAPIST: at the end of August I had already scheduled someone for this time so I’ll let you know for that week. We’ll do a different time.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: But this time works?
CLIENT: That works for me. Cool.
THERAPIST: So I’ll see you then in two weeks.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I’m away next week.
CLIENT: Alright. Let me just put that in my calendar.
THERAPIST: Okay. Great.
CLIENT: Cool.
THERAPIST: So I’ll see you in two weeks then.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Did you like Collapse?
THERAPIST: I actually didn’t get through the whole book.
CLIENT: I’ve been like... I figured it would be as good as Guns, Germs, and Steel but I couldn’t get into it. I made it through like the first twenty percent of it.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I didn’t make it through very far. (LAUGHTER) Take care.
CLIENT: Yeah, take care.
THERAPIST: Bye.
CLIENT: Do you have a bathroom here?
THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. Just... There’s the key and if you just go make a left. It’s right there (inaudible at 00:45:59)
CLIENT: Alright. Thank you. I’ll drop this off at the.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Absolutely.
