DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her anxiety over completing her project and embarrassment over her socioeconomic status compared to others. Client discusses the power and control she feels when being destructive, and her desire to find approval through success.
THERAPIST: Hi! Come on in!
CLIENT: (inaudible)
THERAPIST: I have a question (client affirms) about next Monday. Do you, by any chance, have any flexibility on Tuesday?
CLIENT: Yeah, perhaps. Yeah. What time?
THERAPIST: Let me take a look. Um... the 24th... Yeah, on Tuesday, I’m just wondering, just for next week, if it would be possible to re-schedule. On Tuesday, I could do something in the... midto late morning, in there, around 11:15. Would that be a possibility?
CLIENT: I have to (inaudible).
THERAPIST: What time do you have to be at school?
CLIENT: I will leave at 10:30 or... yeah.
THERAPIST: And so you, are you there till...
CLIENT: 5:00. [00:04:10]
THERAPIST: You’re there till 5:00. What about your Thursday schedule?
CLIENT: Yeah, Thursday could... we could Thursday.
THERAPIST: Is Thursday a possibility? Because I could certainly do something... like, right around lunch... time like, around... just (inaudible)... um... like... around... like, 12:10? (client affirms) Would you be able to do that, so we’d do Wednesday and Thursday, rather than Monday and Wednesday? ","P1-N400251":"(client affirms) Is that good? Okay. So then, I’ll put you in next Thursday at 12:10? (client affirms) Do you want me to e-mail that to you, too? (client affirms) Okay, I’ll do that.
CLIENT: I would, I would confirm it, just...
THERAPIST: Okay. That would be great! Monday is just, I have a little bit of a conflict and I won’t make it. Okay, great! [00:05:08]
CLIENT: Snow makes it... difficult to walk, because it takes longer. (chuckles) (therapist affirms) (pause) Monday was kind of a disappointing session, or maybe I was just in a weird place. (chuckles) Because when I... I, you know, got home and just like... panicked or whatever, spent most of the day ","P1-N4002B1":"just crying. (chuckles) (therapist responds) I had to... I don’t know. I have a deadline coming up, all of a sudden it... I had to submit the whole draft of my novel to be able to do this workshop and... the deadline is coming soon, so I was trying to see okay, what more can I do in the next ten ","P1-N4002B2":"days. So I thought I’d print the whole thing out and like, just that thought, you know like, just is freaking me out. (pause) And I guess just the conversation of like... building versus destroying. (chuckles) I don’t know. I mean, these are, that’s such a dichotomy, I don’t ","P1-N4002B3":"know. I wish I could... look at things differently, I guess. I don’t know. Because those are so stark, you know, opposites.
THERAPIST: Fear about what? [00:08:25]
CLIENT: Well, just you know like... the next phase of editing, and revising, and you know, contacting, you know, editors, or agents or whatever, so...
THERAPIST: So you, what are you looking at his texts for? What are you looking to find?
CLIENT: Well, it just... I guess I’m trying to get entertained, I don’t know. Like, I know he’s texting one of his, they’re in touch, so I’m just, you know, seeing what conversation they’re having. (chuckles) So... (pause) I don’t know what I’m looking ","P1-N400451":"to find. I guess I’m looking... like, catch him, you know. (chuckles) But it’s like, I’m doing the same thing, so... (pause) It was almost like, then... I randomly think, “Oh, Chris would never do this...” (chuckles) Other things like... yeah, but he might. It’s not ","P1-N400452":"like I was completely... happy with him, you know?
THERAPIST: “In this state,” this state being...?
CLIENT: Like, in the state of incompleteness and like, halfway point, the halfway zone. (therapist responds) (pause) Because I feel like, you know, people are not ready or I’m not, you know, ready either, so... you know.
THERAPIST: (pause) Well, even if a situation is out of your hands, you can feel in control of yourself. And I think sometimes you struggle to feel in control of yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah. I try to say that I should separate the situation from myself or...
THERAPIST: Maybe. I wasn’t sort of actively thinking about that. (client affirms) I guess it made me, I was think , because I was going to ask you, and I want to ask you more about what you thought was so upsetting when we were talking, more about what was so upsetting about Monday’s session. ","P1-N4005D1":"But I was thinking about this issue of being, you know, constructive versus destructive, and being in a destructive mode. There is sort of an out of control part of that (client affirms), feeling out of control. [00:21:54]
CLIENT: Yeah. But I do want to talk about constructive\/destructive, because it’s such a dichotomy and it really depresses me. (chuckles) So...
THERAPIST: The dichotomy does, or...?
CLIENT: Yeah, just thinking that I’m like, in a destructive phase, you know. (therapist responds) Yeah, we need to go over that. Like, that really makes me feel out of control. Like, “Oh, you know, it’s like, totally what am I doing? You know, everything is destructive!” (chuckles) ","P1-N400631":"But it’s like, if I pause and think about it, I feel that way only because, you know like, moving out from Chris’s place has me, has put like, a great financial strain on me right now. So... that’s why I feel like, “Oh, I’m destroying my, you know, savings,” you know? ","P1-N400632":"Or, you know, spending a little more than I really, but... (pause) I’m borrowing money, which, you know, is not... the best idea, but it’s like, it’s not permanent, so... And I can put a stop to it by finding, you know, a job, as soon as I feel I’m ready for it. [00:23:12]
THERAPIST: Can you say more about how upset you were on Monday?
CLIENT: Um... yeah. I don’t know. I guess, I mean, it was a weird weekend. I didn’t do much work. I wanted to, but I went shopping with Nelson instead like, both days. I did some work Sunday night, but not enough. I don’t know, it was just a, I’m just at a weird point. I’m ","P1-N400691":"supposed to write (inaudible) in the last chapter, and I was like, looking at it and freaking out, and feeling like, you know, years and years’ worth of work is nothing, you know? (pause) Yeah. Awkward sentences, standing for the hopelessness of the whole project (chuckles) and I’m looking ","P1-N400692":"at them, freaking out. [00:25:30]
THERAPIST: So it sounds like some of the things we talked about on Monday, rather than feeling like, “Oh, okay, well, maybe I could do this,” it just leads you to despair. (client affirms) Look at all the things I can’t do, that I’m not doing, or I didn’t do. It just sort ","P1-N400711":"of heaps (client affirms) on itself.
CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) I feel that way constantly. I mean, there were little pockets earlier, where I didn’t feel that way. (pause) And what is destruction, anyways? Like, is... partying on Friday nights destructive? (pause) I don’t know. Because you have a hangover the next day or like, ","P1-N400731":"you can’t start working at 7:00, but you have to wait until 12:00? Is that destructive? I don’t know. I mean, it’s a genuine question. (chuckles) [00:30:09]
THERAPIST: I don’t know. (client affirms) It depends on, I guess, what are you destroying, right?
CLIENT: Yeah. So 7:00... five hours of work, I guess... (pause) But it gives you this power, doesn’t it? Like, doesn’t that make you feel in control? I mean, it’s ironic. It’s paradoxical, but that’s what it is.
THERAPIST: I’m sorry. What gives you control?
CLIENT: When you’re destroying something, when you’re being destructive. I feel in control, I feel very powerful.
THERAPIST: It certainly gives one the experience of a particular kind of power, I guess.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) So confused. Where is the parameter (ph) we’re talking about? (pause) So what, so, your question about like, the Monday session. Like, what...? What do I do with that information? (chuckles) [00:31:20]
THERAPIST: (pause) I’m sorry. I didn’t follow the question about Monday’s session.
CLIENT: Yeah, so I mean, the conclusion was, I mean, I, it made me despair.
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like that was part of it.
CLIENT: Yeah. Should I talk more about that, or...? What should I talk about? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Where do you think the question is coming from?
CLIENT: Which question?
THERAPIST: You’re asking me what you should talk about.
CLIENT: No, there is like, several threads, so now I’m like... what do I do now? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: It sounds like you do. I was thinking that. It sounds like you hear judgment. “You should have planned better!” [00:34:06]
CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) So, I mean, there is something that converts that positive into negative, right? I guess that’s the piece we want to understand and disempower. (chuckles) So...
THERAPIST: Well, with the... the planning piece. You know, what you were saying, I mean, what you’re saying, ultimately like, sort of at its foundation is, you know, “Look at all these things I don’t have any control over.” And I’m sort of, my retort is, “You actually ","P1-N4009B1":"could control them, and that maybe it would be a better idea to take more control over them, given the situation. Like, it, maybe...” And then there is a way in which you’re like, that you convert that to... you know, “I can’t do anything right,” or (client affirms) “I’ve ","P1-N4009B2":"messed up or ruined something.” (client affirms) (pause) What, at those moments, when I talk to you like that, I definitely am not talking a victim’s narrative (chuckles) or helpless narrative. Like, “Oh, you could do something about that!” And if you’re in a place where ","P1-N4009B3":"you’re feeling there is nothing I can do about that, I think sometimes it almost makes you angry. It’s like, “I can’t do anything about this!” [00:35:23]
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it was just abstract. If we had like, been more concrete I would have understood it better? Like... yeah. I guess I was thinking of all those nights, or months, that I spent (sighs) writing and not really getting anywhere, and by getting anywhere, it just means like, the New Yorker ","P1-N4009D1":"saying, “Yay, we love you! Come on board,” you know. And not, you know, that I was slowly building up towards... something. You know, nothing is a waste. Far from it, you know.
THERAPIST: So when you were crying, is it like... sadness or it is frustration? Because you were saying that you were crying lot on Monday. [00:36:26]
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, just... it was just like, feeling really... scared and... what am I doing, just... yeah, just fear, you know. What’s next, what’s going to happen? You know. I’m in like, a hole or a puddle, how do I dig myself out? Just feeling pain, you know. (pause) Will I find ","P1-N400A11":"a job again? Will I have money again? You know. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well, with that sort of uncertainty, there is also the... The counterpoint is that there is a lot of power and control. You can do a lot of things. It’s your choice. And it’s almost like... you retreat from that. Like, actually, you could get a job, or not get a job. Or you could ","P1-N400A31":"do this, you could... You actually have a lot of choice. And there is almost like, too much anxiety about having so much power.
CLIENT: (high-pitched surprise) What?
THERAPIST: You don’t think? [00:37:40]
CLIENT: (laughs) Where is that? Where is the power? What are you seeing? What...? Yeah.
THERAPIST: Well, the power in the choice. Nothing is being foisted upon you. You could take a lot of different directions, and it’s up to you to decide which direction you’re going to take.
CLIENT: That’s true.
THERAPIST: And it seems like that can be very overwhelming.
CLIENT: It is, yeah.
THERAPIST: In those moments, you just want to be told what to do.
CLIENT: No!
THERAPIST: No? Well, maybe that’s not true.
CLIENT: (chuckles) I remember when it used to be very true. Not so long ago, I wanted to be told what to do. (therapist responds) Yeah. That, you kept saying that. You just want to be told what to do in, you just want to be told... I remember. But I feel like, it’s... I don’t know, again, ","P1-N400B91":"hard to be objective. But I feel like I’ve outgrown that. [00:38:32]
THERAPIST: I’m wrong.
CLIENT: No, no, no! No, I mean, you were right, you were right when you... You probably are still right. (chuckles) But I feel like I’ve outgrown...
THERAPIST: Outgrown, yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. But...
THERAPIST: Sometimes you need to correct me. (client chuckles) I’m serious.
CLIENT: Yeah, okay.
THERAPIST: I don’t know everything. And there are a lot of things you know.
CLIENT: Hmm... Yeah, well, I feel like I have outgrown that phase of... wanting to be told... what to do. (pause) I guess I want... to keep doing, and feeling strong, and positive, and confident, and winning, you know? I want to win! (chuckles) [00:39:42]
THERAPIST: What do you want to win?
CLIENT: I want to win like... approval and... get, you know, my book out, and... (sighs) write more books (chuckles), and be happy, and be successful in that way, you know. And... then sort out a few messes and... feel positive about helping my mom. (pause) I used to say that I want to help her, but ","P1-N400CD1":"I am, and I look back and like, I’ve been helping (chuckles) her. So... it’s just that not feeling very good about helping her. So... we’ll see what (inaudible).
THERAPIST: Can you say more?
CLIENT: (pause) Feel... very much like Chris. (chuckles) You plan a day, and you you’re your week. (pause) You plan chapters, you plan every scene, you plan... to see things from one draft to the next. That’s, that’s it, you know?
THERAPIST: Are you feeling grounded by what you can control?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah! I mean, yeah. (pause) (sighs) The night that Nelson has dinner with his ex-girlfriend, I can... you know, I’m sure I’ll be watching a movie. I won’t be with Chris or my mom. Maybe even cooking (chuckles), you know? So I have a plan. (pause) That’s in my control. [00:43:22]
THERAPIST: (pause) Is he still friends with his ex-girlfriend, is that why he’s having dinner with her?
CLIENT: Yeah. I just choose to take it in that way, whether there is truth to it, that’s how I take it. I don’t know. Like, she’s, like they’re like... flirt, flirty, I guess? Actually, I really don’t care. It’s got nothing to do with me. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well, if you’re serious about someone, I understand why you wouldn’t want him to be flirting with anyone else.
CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah, but I guess, you know, you have a connection with your ex...
THERAPIST: I think what I said is sort of an ultimate goal, but you have a complicated situation, too. [00:44:20]
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I think the trick, really, with him is to not think much about stuff. (pause)
THERAPIST: Because otherwise...?
CLIENT: I mean, it’s just... weird like... he’ll buy me stuff. Not every weekend, he doesn’t have to buy stuff. Sometimes. (chuckles) (pause) But then, he won’t, you know like... you know, he... So like, I’m thinking, “Oh, you’re in town this week. I would call ","P1-N400ED1":"me every night and be like, What are you doing? Let’s have dinner. Let’s cook dinner, you know?” (therapist affirms) But he won’t do that, so then I’m like, “Why?” And I’m like, you know, I don’t even need to like, you know, whatever, you want... ","P1-N400ED2":"to see me after dinner, you know. (chuckles) So fine. Whatever. I just shouldn’t keep waiting around, though, you know. [00:45:35]
THERAPIST: You know, Cecelia (ph), we’re going to need to stop for today. So do you want to e-mail me to confirm that Thursday time? Is that, you want me to e-mail you?
CLIENT: Yeah, can you e-mail?
THERAPIST: That’s fine.
CLIENT: I’ll just look at my... calendar or whatever.
THERAPIST: That’s totally fine.
CLIENT: I should be able to make it at that, like time, that next day or Friday, but I hope to be able to... finish that.
THERAPIST: Thanks.
CLIENT: Thank you. Have a good week!
THERAPIST: Okay, very good. Take care.
