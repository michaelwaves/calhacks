DESCRIPTION: Client discusses his sadness over his wife's recent hospitalization. Client discusses the trust he places in his therapist and how it makes him feel safe during this difficult time.
THERAPIST: Hi! Come on in!
CLIENT: (pause) Oh, these are for you.
THERAPIST: Oh, thank you.
CLIENT: The bank mailed me an overdraft statement, so I thought I’d give you a copy of it.
THERAPIST: Okay, but... here. (client affirms) I assume you... that is correct.
CLIENT: Okay, thanks.
THERAPIST: On the issue of trust.
CLIENT: (chuckles) (pause) So I... took Tanya to the ER yesterday, so she’s back in Frederick now. I walked with her, I didn’t make the decision, I just went with her. So... (pause) that’s happening.
THERAPIST: (pause) Well, that’s part of what happened, and then there is what’s happening in you.
CLIENT: So I, we’ve done this a few times, and I sort of expected that to be, you know, your response would be somewhere in that line. So I was sort of wondering why I felt like starting with the facts was the important thing anyway. I still think it is. But... that came to mind, so...
THERAPIST: (pause) I’m sorry.
CLIENT: Thanks.
THERAPIST: I imagine this is upsetting and discouraging.
CLIENT: (pause) It’s definitely upsetting. Yeah, it’s... discouraging is probably right, but I, it’s like... this doesn’t seem... I mean, A) it doesn’t seem as bad as it’s been other times. It’s like she is more able to cope with the suicidal ideation and feelings ","P1-N400431":"and thoughts like, this is, it seems pretty clear that this is a place that she goes when she gets overwhelmed. But that... I think largely through some distance from some of the most acute original causes and some, and a whole lot of work and therapy with Chad, she is more able to cope with... with ","P1-N400432":"the stress or the whatever. [00:13:14]
THERAPIST: (pause) I guess I used the word “discouraging” because I think one is discouraged when one is expecting something to go in one direction and it goes in another direction. Maybe I’m... imputing that to the situation. Maybe you weren’t feeling that way. [00:16:35]
CLIENT: (pause) I think... (sighs) There has been a strange element this time around, where like, I have not felt like this is a thing in my control, and that’s been okay. Like... (pause) The phrase that’s kind of come to mind several times is that “this is not about me,” which ","P1-N4004D1":"is sort of a weird... phrase anyway, and a little weirder in this context. But it sort of gets at the... the feeling like... (pause) Yeah, I can’t fix her, I can’t fix this for her. There are some things I can do to help, and I’ve tried to do them. But... yeah. I don’t know, ","P1-N4004D2":"I guess I don’t... [00:18:00]
THERAPIST: (pause) That is a big change.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think it concerns me, because I think that there is a... there is a... part of me that... sort of feels like, “Well, at least if she killed herself, I could deal with that, and it would solve the problem of... do I leave her or do I stay in this particularly horrible situation ","P1-N400551":"that’s not always horrible, but is tough.” (chuckles) I’m not particularly happy about that part of me, but I sort of understand it, so... I actually think it’s a good thing to feel like this is not in my control, and that I shouldn’t be trying to control it. But that other ","P1-N400552":"piece, I don’t know. Seemed related and bothers me. [00:21:01]
THERAPIST: (pause) That you feel that way? (client affirms) (pause) Well, it speaks to... maybe a burden you feel about not knowing what to do and what this means.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think that’s right, I think that’s right. Yeah. Because it’s sort of like, “Well, at least the burden would be gone, so...” Short way of saying it, yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (chuckles) What was your concern?
CLIENT: Um, yeah, so (sighs), I, of course, would have the concern anyway, right? Because I feel like I have to take care of you. But I respond to that, “No, no, it’s okay. (chuckles) I don’t need to take care of you. I need to be here so that you can take care of me.” And thank ","P1-N400631":"you for that. But then you sighed, and so you’ve... You’ve sighed twice in this session, and you don’t usually sigh, so it was sort of a, you know... so I asked. Here we are.
THERAPIST: I feel sad about the situation, and I feel sad for you. I can feel with you. I can imagine, or try to imagine, the weight of that burden is. So I have all of those feelings, but I also feel okay, too. [00:24:37]
CLIENT: Hmm! Thank you. So why? (chuckles) Why would you imagine that? (pause) I understand why, but, and thank you for doing it, but that... that seems like a lot.
THERAPIST: This is your space.
CLIENT: (chuckles) I don’t have any particular thing, you know. Just I feel like we have been... not on a perfectly linear path, we’re kind of following several themes for several weeks. I would prefer to hold onto that somewhat, if possible.
THERAPIST: Trusting you in what ways?
CLIENT: I feel like you’ve been more open about what you’re thinking, or what you do or think about it. I don’t know that that’s actually accurate, but that’s how I, how I feel, so that seemed like... I actually think that some of the things you’ve said, you said ","P1-N400751":"before, so it’s not like... So, I... anyway, I don’t know exactly where the feeling comes from, but it seemed important to mention. (pause) I like it.
THERAPIST: (pause) Well, do you feel like you’re trying to move away from the topic of Tanya being re-hospitalized?
CLIENT: I didn’t when I started doing it. I actually did feel better. It’s sort of like I, in trying to move away, I felt like it’s been harder to access the other space, or something like that. Yeah, so...
THERAPIST: Not really.
CLIENT: Do you think of yourself as a medical professional?
THERAPIST: No. Definitely not that.
CLIENT: Interesting. Okay. So the analogy that sort of came to mind last week, or afterwards, was that it was like you are a scientist whose instrument was herself, because you were talking sort of both feeling and watching yourself feel things, and using that as the... I thought that was very interesting. ","P1-N400891":"It seems really hard. [00:32:46]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I think this, you know, I don’t think of myself as a scientist, but I think in a very broad definition, sure. Like, that fits.
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I don’t particularly need you to be a scientist. I think you’re more of a wizard than a scientist, anyway, but... I just... that was the analogy that had been, sort of comes to me, because I know a lot of people who, you know, do one instrument or something, sort of ","P1-N4008D1":"get to know the instrument very well. So I was curious.
THERAPIST: And the medical professional part?
CLIENT: That was actually just, I don’t know. You said no to scientist and it, that question popped in my head, so I asked it.
THERAPIST: But a wizard is something altogether different.
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. You know, there is, there are all sorts of sort of pithy responses to that, right? The old, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, or... you know, the methods the alchemists followed were pretty similar to the methods that early chemists followed, ","P1-N400971":"or pretty similar to the ones we follow now. It’s just some information content difference. Yeah, it’s altogether different, but I feel like... people, and the things people do, and things we care about are kind of... more similar than we talk about, across time and professions. But yeah, ","P1-N400972":"it is an altogether different description, or way of conceptualizing, what you do. [00:35:30]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, I don’t think of my primary care doctor as a wizard. (client chuckles) He can be very helpful. (client laughs)
CLIENT: I don’t think of your primary care doctor as a wizard, either, but... We’ve talked about this before. It’s one of the... worse analogies that I’ve used, because it’s more opaque (ph) for you, I think, so it’s...
THERAPIST: Well, it certainly has a particular connotations, usually.
CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. I don’t think I need all of the connotations that it has, so... But...
THERAPIST: Well, is it, when I think of wizard, I think of magic, there is usually magic involved.
CLIENT: Sure, sure.
THERAPIST: Because you’re a scientist?
CLIENT: Or maybe they both come from the same... piece of me. I am a scientist and I care about that, because of who I am, you know. (pause) See, I also don’t think of myself as a scientist, although I very much am, in terms of like...
THERAPIST: What are you thinking?
CLIENT: Um, so initially I was expecting you to tell me the time was up, because I sort of thought that was a thing that you would respond to, because you went through several “Hmm’s.” Then we were looking at each other and you kept doing that.
THERAPIST: Time is almost up, but we still have like, a minute. (client chuckles) It wasn’t up at that point, actually. (client affirms)
CLIENT: Yeah, so, anyway, so I have tried to follow the, some of the themes we were talking about. It’s really... I feel like, scattered to the wind a whole lot, but... Okay with it.
THERAPIST: There is a lot going on. (client affirms) Here is when we actually do need to stop. (client affirms) Okay, I’ll see you next week.
CLIENT: All right, thank you.
THERAPIST: Take care. Bye bye.
