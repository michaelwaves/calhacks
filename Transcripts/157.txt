TITLE: Client "Vn" Therapy Session Audio Recording, April 16, 2014: Client is trying to work out a child support schedule with her ex.
DESCRIPTION: Client is trying to work out a child support schedule with her ex.
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in.
CLIENT: Hi. Sorry I’m late.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:03:08) the office. How are you?
CLIENT: Good. Thank you. It’s snowing again. (Laughter)
THERAPIST: Is it snowing right now?
CLIENT: No, it’s just ice cold outside.
THERAPIST: It is cold.
CLIENT: To wake up and see snow in April is like really mean.
THERAPIST: How are things?
CLIENT: Things are good. I think so. [What is it?] (ph) I haven’t (ph) seen you in two weeks?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So, Rich and I are slowly getting to some sort of an agreement. We’re still trying to finalize the numbers because now that I’ve requested for child support, there is like a different calculation that they have to do. So the amount actually ended up being a little bit less.
THERAPIST: You’re more focused on appeasing him.
CLIENT: Right. Right. Since he’s kind of calm. (inaudible at 00:06:47) he’s nice now. It’s almost easier for me to be like, “No. I need this much money. I need you to give me this much money.” And like we had conversation; he called me on Monday and was like, “You ","P1-N400331":"know, it’s a lot of money you’re asking me to pay. You know, if it’s $1,500 for day care and then you’re asking for $1,300 for child support, it’s over half of what I’m bringing home.” And he’s like, “I still have to pay for everything else.” ","P1-N400332":"And I was like, “I understand. We can figure something out.”
THERAPIST: Do you think you have difficulty in part just because of your history with your parents [fighting about that stuff]? (ph)
CLIENT: Yeah. Totally. Totally. I think I tend to ignore it. I mean, I should be more focused on my… I have a budget and I have a spreadsheet for my bills and stuff, but I tend to just —”Oh, right I don’t have that much money.” And I then I just don’t even think about ","P1-N400531":"because I don’t want to be so upset and so stressed out about it the way I was growing up all the time. I mean it’s weird because I think, “Oh, shit. I’m on my own.” So I really have to be kind of aware of it. I have to kind of not be so afraid to deal with it, because ","P1-N400532":"I could easily run out of money. And I have Brady to take care of. [00:15:53]
THERAPIST: What, [is it] (ph) just happened to be this credit card is under your name?
CLIENT: He never got any credit cards under his name, because I just had them, so if we went out or did something… He had like a work credit card that he would use for travel. But his company would pay it off right away. But Rich always just, I mean, he always had a lot of money so he never really ","P1-N4005D1":"had to charge anything unless we were going on a trip or something where we would charge something big, I would just be the one to put it on my credit card. [00:18:08]
THERAPIST: It’s unusual for someone not to have any credit cards.
CLIENT: I know. I used to tell him. I would be like, “You know, you should probably get one to build your credit.” He’s like, “Well, I have the work one.” So that’s what he would use. So anything us related is all under my name. And there’s a gas one that, I ","P1-N400611":"think we owe like $300, so he was like, “Let’s just hold (ph) that one and finish it up.” But there’s one that’s the biggest one. That’s where we’ve had debt on it for many years. And that’s the one we were deciding whether he’ll pay half or the ","P1-N400612":"whole thing. He said whole thing, if I don’t ask for alimony; he’ll pay the whole credit card bill. [00:18:59]
THERAPIST: When your parents fought about money, what would they fight about?
CLIENT: Mainly they would fight about the fact that my dad is really cheap or frugal, I guess you could say.
THERAPIST: Depending on who you ask?
CLIENT: I know.(Laughter) My mom, on the other hand, was really bad with money in the sense that if we had it, if we had any, she would just like… my mom was good and she thought we should go to private school. I mean, my parents were very poor and did not make a lot of money. I think my dad made ","P1-N400711":"like $30,000 a year and my mom probably made less than that.
THERAPIST: What did they do for work?
CLIENT: My dad is a janitor, and then my mom, she was a receptionist in an office. But she was never certified. I mean, she got some certification, but it wasn’t like she was some high paid nurse or anything like that. So, my dad would get frustrated because she had us all go to private school, ","P1-N400751":"which was great. Because she was very big on our education, where my dad was like, “They should just go to public school.” But my mom was like, “No. They should go to private school.” [00:23:45]
THERAPIST: Are they still in the same financial position they were when you were growing up?
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, my mom hasn’t worked now…I mean, she’s 72? So she hasn’t worked for a few years. My dad still works, but he doesn’t make that much. And I don’t know how much they have in debt. They’re still paying off the house. I don’t know how ","P1-N400851":"they’re going to retire, quite honestly. They don’t have very much money now. I mean, they have a house and they can… So it’s hard for me to ask them for money because I know they don’t have it. If I knew they were fine and can afford to give it to me, but that’s ","P1-N400852":"why I haven’t said anything to them because they need it themselves.
THERAPIST: Well, and with your mom.
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: Your mom was like that.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Totally. So… (pause) Now I keep saying that I need to get to May. I think that’s what I said when I started. I just need to get to May. And May is here. And I think I’m doing all right. So now I’m saying I need to get to September. And hopefully all the finances ","P1-N4008F1":"and stuff will be…I think it’ll totally be settled by then. I imagine, but… [00:29:17]
THERAPIST: Did your mother want to marry someone who made more money?
CLIENT: She never said that. She never specifically said that. She’s just really bad about… when she has it, she won’t keep it. She won’t like, “Let’s put this in savings.” She’ll be like, “I just got a bonus at work. Let’s go buy your brother ","P1-N400931":"the thing he’s been wanting.” That’s kind of how she’s always been. And she’s never stressed about money. She and I are very similar in that we kind of think about it, but we don’t let it ruin our day. Where my dad would just be like… he’s still (inaudible ","P1-N400932":"at 00:30:03), “Oh, my God.”
THERAPIST: How old was he when he moved here?
CLIENT: He moved here in 1975, so he was 23? My mom was 27? She’s older than him.
THERAPIST: They came here together?
CLIENT: No. She came here by herself first to meet a friend in DC. They kind of had dated a little bit and then she moved because she wanted to come to the US, and then he came kind of very soon after and then found her in DC. And then they got married in DC.
THERAPIST: Because they’re going to complain. Because you anticipate they’re going to complain?
CLIENT: Yeah. I think they’re going to keep asking, “Why and why and why?” And even though I give an answer, they’re not going to understand. And they’re going to be like, “Do you understand what this is doing to Brady?” That’s like a big thing. And then ","P1-N400AB1":"they’re going to be like, “Are you sure you can’t make it work?” They’re going to keep asking like that. I think they’re going to think that there’s an opportunity to keep getting back together and I have to be like, “There isn’t.” We’re ","P1-N400AB2":"both kind of… I mean, Rich doesn’t want to get back together and I don’t so… They just need to kind of accept that. And it’s hard because they’re not here, so they don’t see how things are going. So they just kind of hear whatever they hear from me. (Pause) [00:34:40]
THERAPIST: Do you?
CLIENT: Just to like… I don’t know. Work his feelings out. But maybe he’s doing all right. I don’t know. He seems to go out a lot, which is good.
THERAPIST: This is surprising to you?
CLIENT: Yes. Because he never did. He hardly did with me. Like hardly. So, it’s like, “Wow. That’s great!” That’s good that he’s doing that. I hope he’s met someone. That would be great if he has some like… You know, I’ll be thrilled when he has ","P1-N400B71":"a nice girl friend. Then I’m like, “Oh wait, they have to meet Brady.” And then I was like, “Oh, it’s fine.” But it’d be nice to see him happy with someone. I think that would be a good thing for him. But he seems to be enjoying time and going out with friends ","P1-N400B72":"or whoever. [00:37:01]
THERAPIST: It seems like a big change. You describe him as being kind of very homebody.
CLIENT: He would never go out, unless I was like, “We have plans to go do something.” So it’s weird to be like, “Oh, he’s going out on his own.” Like he’s making plans with people, because he would hardly ever do. He would make plans with his guy friends or ","P1-N400BB1":"like, “Hey, we’re all going out for a beer.” And they would e-mail him and he’s like, “All right. I’m going to go.” But it’s not like he would be like, “Hey everyone! Let’s all go get dinner.” He’s not like that all. But maybe this ","P1-N400BB2":"has kind of forced him to be because he doesn’t want to sit at home alone. It’s probably easier to sit at home with me. But even then, some of the times, I wasn’t even home. [00:37:48]
THERAPIST: A lot has changed in a very fairly short period of time.
CLIENT: I know. It’s weird. It’s so bizarre. It’s really bizarre. Yeah, because I’m like, “It’s only April.” But it feels like it’s been a long time, but it hasn’t really been that long of a time. It’s only been 2 ½ months since I moved ","P1-N400BF1":"out. Yeah. Sometimes I wonder if it’s like—I know it’s a good thing for me. I’m like, “I wonder if it’s a good thing for him?” I wouldn’t really ask him that, but… (chuckles)
THERAPIST: You think that got through to him?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Now I’m a little bit more communicative. It’s like, “Oh, I’m at a movie tonight so I’ll try calling…” I’ll be more about what I’m doing, where before I just wouldn’t even say anything. So I think that definitely may have ","P1-N400C71":"been like, “Oh, if I keep doing this she’s just going to basically say ‘hello’ and ‘bye’ and leave it at that.” And he doesn’t seem to want that kind of relationship. [00:40:01]
THERAPIST: You guess?
CLIENT: No. It is nice of him.
THERAPIST: Are you suspicious? [00:40:51]
CLIENT: No. No, I’m not. I probably would have been a few weeks ago. (Pause) Because when we Face Time he can see that I’m not home sometimes and before he would be like, “Where are you?” And I would just be like, “I’m out having dinner,” or something. And then ","P1-N400D11":"now he just doesn’t ask if I’m outside or in some loud place or something. And I don’t know if that’s because he’s going out too, or he’ll text and say, “Oh, can I talk to Brady now because I have to go out soon.” And I’m just like, “Oh, okay. ","P1-N400D12":"Sure.” And it would be nice to keep it this way and amicable and nice.
THERAPIST: Sounds like things have settled down a lot.
CLIENT: Yeah. They have, which is good. And I think for him, the best thing has been seeing Brady. I think his biggest concern was how Brady was going to react to all of this and what we were doing to him. And I think having seen that Brady is just kind of rolling with it has helped him to… I ","P1-N400D71":"mean, it’s helped me tremendously, but it has definitely helped him be less stressed maybe about it all? (Pause) May is almost here. (Laughs)
THERAPIST: It’s right around the corner [00:43:24]
CLIENT: I know (laughs). It’ll be good (ph). Mother’s Day I’m going to go to my best friend in DC. I’m taking Brady with me for the weekend. She’s like, “Come. Let’s have Mother’s Day together.” Because Mother’s Day I used to always spend it ","P1-N400DB1":"with my mother-in-law too so it would be kind of a bigger thing. And this year I was just kind of like, “Oh, it’s just going to be me and Brady. I guess we’ve got to figure out what to do.” And she was like, “Come to DC. Come to see us. We can all go out. My mother is here.” ","P1-N400DB2":"And I’m very good friends with her mom and she has two little kids so she was like, “We’ll all hang out for the weekend and have a good Mother’s Day weekend.” [So it’s] (ph) like, “Oh, that’s perfect. That’ll be great.” So I’ll do that. ","P1-N400DB3":"That’ll be fun.
THERAPIST: [It’ll] (ph) be your first time as a mom, being single. [00:44:11]
CLIENT: I know. It’s weird to be like, “I’m a single mom?” It sounds so weird (laughs). And it’s funny because now I’ve been going out and I get approached by guys, which is nice. I’m like, “Oh, people still find me attractive.” Then I have to be ","P1-N400DF1":"like, “Well, I have a son and 35.” A lot of them tend to, which is nice, they tend to think I’m younger, which is nice, but it’s weird to then be like, “Oh, that’s great. Yeah, that’s awesome.” Like they don’t care? I just assumed that guys are freaked ","P1-N400DF2":"out by that.
THERAPIST: Men (ph) your age or, you know, probably less so.
CLIENT: Right, right. That’s true.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:44:56) appropriate. Maybe a 25 year old would be, but… maybe not. I don’t know.
CLIENT: Well, one of them was a 25-year-old. I was like, “I have a son and I’m getting divorced.” He was like, “Oh. Okay. I was wondering how you were single. It doesn’t make sense.” I was like, “Well, that’s very nice of you to say (laughs).” And ","P1-N400E71":"he’s like, “Well, that’s great.” And then he asked me about my son.
THERAPIST: Well, we are actually (inaudible at 00:45:20] we are out of time for today. So I will see you then in two weeks.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: So I will see you then in two weeks.
CLIENT: Yes. Actually, you know what? I’m going to still be in Richmond. So I could e-mail you because I come back on the 30th, I think.
THERAPIST: Yeah, let me just… because I have you on my schedule now as every other week. But you’re not going to be here.
CLIENT: On that Wednesday. I’m back May 1st from my trip. So I think my next appointment would have been April 30th, but I fly back that day from Richmond.
THERAPIST: Okay, I see. We could find another time that week or we could meet the 7th and the 14th if you wanted to go for, I don’t know, for three (inaudible at 00:46:09)
CLIENT: Yeah, we could do that.
THERAPIST: Do you want to do that?
CLIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Because I’ll probably be super busy at work anyway that Thursday and Friday catching up from being gone.
THERAPIST: Okay. Then I’m going to take you out for the 30th and put you in for the 7th. So I’m not going to see you for 3 weeks then, but then I’ll see you the following week.
CLIENT: Okay. On the 7th at 11:30?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Okay. Great. And then in the meantime, I didn’t bring a check today but…
THERAPIST: It’s okay.
CLIENT: I can put one in the mail. Do I have your address actually?
THERAPIST: It’s at the footer of my…
CLIENT: The invoice?
THERAPIST: At the footer of my e-mails.
CLIENT: Oh, okay.
THERAPIST: [I’m sure if] (ph) you want to that that’s fine.
CLIENT: Okay. Great.
