DESCRIPTION: Client discusses how her parents' relationship has had a negative impact on how she perceives sex, strip clubs, and naked bodies.
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in. (pause) [00:01:20]
CLIENT: Hi. How are you?
THERAPIST: Good. Thank you. (pause) [00:03:40]
CLIENT: {Sneezes
THERAPIST: Bless you. [00:04:00]
CLIENT: I don’t know where to start. {Sneezes
THERAPIST: Bless you.
CLIENT: Thank you. (pause) [00:05:15]
THERAPIST: It’s definitely a balance between taking anything because you’re expecting nothing. [00:17:30]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And being chronically disappointed and frustrated and angry because you expect so much. I do agree that you do error, at least some of the time, on expecting to have such high expectations that you chronically feel disappointed.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Maybe sort of the compromise is open mindedness.
CLIENT: Yeah. I’m trying to be open minded.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you are. It very much sounds like you are.
CLIENT: Yeah. So, this new thing has come up in my head. This might open Pandora’s box. {Laughter} How did it come up? I have to think about how it came up because the context is important. I can’t remember exactly now. Never mind. I’ll just ask you. Nelson was kind of, I don’t ","P1-N4003F1":"know. I think he was changing and suddenly he started to do a strip, a pretend strip tease or something. I was laughing at him and I don’t know how it came up, but he said something about going to a strip club or something. [00:19:00]
THERAPIST: Being like that meaning?
CLIENT: He was very, I don’t know. Maybe instead of using adjectives, I’ll just say what he used to do. He used to watch a lot of porn and sleep around a lot. I think all of this came out just during the last year of my college. My mom was really, really traumatized and was thinking of leaving ","P1-N400451":"him. This was also in the context of us all going to church and stuff. Yeah. She was really traumatized. She was very. She bottled it all up for like 20 years and never told me anything about his behavior, but it all kind of slowly started coming out or very quickly came out, I guess. [00:21:00]
THERAPIST: Your father’s masculinity, in part, is somewhat predatory.
CLIENT: Yeah? In what way? [00:29:00]
THERAPIST: Predatory sounds a little too malevolent. I don’t see your father as the malevolent type predator.
CLIENT: Oh, he was.
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Would you call him a predator?
CLIENT: Oh yeah. He would be, he could, when he was younger, he was very proud of the fact that he could seduce any woman he wanted. Later on in life, it became very upsetting.
THERAPIST: Would he brag about that to you?
CLIENT: As much as he could to a ten year old, yeah.
THERAPIST: How? How would he brag about it?
CLIENT: I don’t know. He would brag about his body. Like, if I want to tone this muscle, I can do it. If I want to lose this much weight I can do it. Something like that. { Laughter
THERAPIST: So, predatory is accurate?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: There’s sort of different ways of thinking about masculinity and types of masculinity. [00:30:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That version of masculinity amidst certain places is predatory.
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it’s always my fear. Will I end up with someone like my dad? I don’t want to. I mean I guess I’m trying. I don’t know. I don’t think I should say that that was his appeal to my mom. I don’t think so. Yeah. I mean I don’t know if Nelson ","P1-N400771":"is predatory. I don’t think he is. I mean I guess this is in the context of being open. It’s like how much more open can I get? I’m thinking it’s okay. I’m thinking I shouldn’t freak out if my boyfriend goes or has been to a strip club. [00:31:00]
THERAPIST: Where was it?
CLIENT: At some club in D.C. I can’t remember the name. I didn’t think the world had come crashing down. I guess at that time I didn’t really know. I didn’t really interpret him looking at that as oh. Why do you think my mom was so saddened by that?
THERAPIST: By?
CLIENT: Traumatized by that.
THERAPIST: What’s that?
CLIENT: My dad going to such places.
THERAPIST: What do you think it could be?
CLIENT: I don’t know.
THERAPIST: It seems like you can relate to it.
CLIENT: Yeah, but I don’t want to. I don’t want to be like that’s strange behavior.
THERAPIST: What’s strange? I’m sorry, I’m losing you. What strange behavior? Your mother relating to it or your dad? [00:32:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. My mom being traumatized by that. I want to say that I find it strange.
THERAPIST: That she was traumatized that he went to strip clubs?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I don’t know. I guess probably a lot of women don’t want their husbands frequenting strip clubs.
CLIENT: Why?
THERAPIST: Why do people ride against it? Why do women’s fears ride against it?
CLIENT: They do because it’s like those women are exploited. I doubt that my mom has a bit of, I mean she doesn’t wish them ill, but I doubt she has their good in her heart when she’s like don’t do that. [00:33:00]
THERAPIST: It seems to me different. That there’s a difference between someone going once or a couple times to frequenting one.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It seems like a big difference.
CLIENT: That’s true. That is true.
THERAPIST: It seems like one is sort of curiosity or interest and the other is kind of something habitual or addictive.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But it does make you anxious.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t really want to be because it’s got nothing to do with me. You know? I mean it’s their sexuality. It’s their kind of their way of getting sexual stimulation. If it isn’t mine, then mine might be something else. As long as they’re not judging me, ","P1-N400AF1":"I shouldn’t be judging them. [00:35:00]
THERAPIST: It also makes me think about our conversations about relationships as transactions.
CLIENT: Yeah. (silence from 00:35:35 to 00:36:35) I guess I’m trying, I’m starting to feel and see things differently about that. Like, I was talking to Nelson once and he was like at the end of the day, who am I with? Who do I come back to? I was like, it was weird the way he phrased that ","P1-N400B51":"sentence. As though he frequents strip clubs and then comes to me. Neither of those two things are true. We don’t live together. He doesn’t frequent, I hope. I don’t know. I guess I thought about what he said and what happens at a strip club, that is transactional. [00:37:30]
THERAPIST: Not everything that’s not intensely connective is transactional.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Which is, I guess, when people say I have invested in you or I’m investing in this relationship, I guess that also doesn’t mean that it’s transactional. { Laughter} It could because it’s the same kind of, you know, monetary reference.
THERAPIST: It depends on what they’re investing.
CLIENT: Yeah. No, but like you invest time and you get back time. [00:39:00]
THERAPIST: But, if you’re investing in yourself as a person, I don’t see that as transactional.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It seems like one of the big differences between a relationship that’s sort of a genuine one versus serving a transaction is whether you value that person for them as a person or as the function they serve.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, that’s a bit harder to distinguish, I think. I mean everyone serves a purpose.
THERAPIST: That’s true. They’re fulfilling a need, but I guess, so that’s true. You’re seeking them out because you have a need. If you got in them simply for their utility and not who they are. [00:40:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know. I guess as a writer I just feel, I see that as people have their purposes and you love them for who they are, but who they are is a question in the universe. Their answer to the question. Investing is more like growing a tree or planting a tree. You don’t necessarily, ","P1-N400CB1":"I mean you have the hope of eating the fruit at some point, but it’s a gamble. You don’t know if it’s going to grow or what will happen. So many things are out of your control. You invest because at that time, that’s what you want to do with your time and energy and money. At ","P1-N400CB2":"that point it makes you feel good and then over time you realize that that little investment is like a big tree now and something you can depend on. That’s not transactional. [00:41:30]
THERAPIST: How do you mean she didn’t get what she wanted?
CLIENT: She didn’t get, I mean she wanted my dad to be around and to get a job and be a proper husband and he never did that. Instead he wasted time in meaningless interactions, transactions, you know. She did love him profoundly, but he just wasn’t able to love her back.
THERAPIST: You saw that in her?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What do you think that love was about? [00:42:45]
CLIENT: I don’t know. A lot of things. Their own needs. Also, the need to be needed. The need to take care of him. Genuine attraction and chemistry and knowing someone for so long and feeling like she’s the only one who understands him and everyone else thinks he’s a douche bag. Then, ","P1-N400D91":"over time, sharing life. Sharing profound experiences. Mostly most of them are negative. Their marriage was a complete mess. That’s my take on it anyway. (pause) [00:44:15]
THERAPIST: Their relationship. Your mom’s feelings about your dad?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Your feelings about your dad and all of it?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It was a very traumatic experience.
CLIENT: Yeah. I just don’t want it to be that much. Not anymore. I feel somehow more positive about my childhood because like the finishing years in the US when all of this was happening were worse.
THERAPIST: We should end.
CLIENT: Okay. I hope you have a great day.
THERAPIST: Thank you. Thank you so much. Bye.
CLIENT: Bye.
