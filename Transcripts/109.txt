TITLE: Client "C" Therapy Session Audio Recording, September 18, 2012: Client talks about his awareness of self-control issues.
DESCRIPTION: Client talks about his awareness of self-control issues.
CLIENT: So I did a lot of thinking about the combative side of me and how I do, you know, think about ways of just, you know, engaging and confrontation. And there are a lot of situations that I’m faced with that, you know, I don’t even think about, but they are combative.
THERAPIST: What kind of control do you feel you have? What control does it help you to have?
CLIENT: Control over myself, over my own life. Like I mentioned before, I feel like my life has always been guided to how it’s supposed to be instead of what I wanted it to be. And I feel with this leverage I have the ability to take my life where I want it to go instead of bringing it to the ","P1-N400161":"way that everybody else wants me to go. And you know it’s starting to make more sense to me. You know, how independently I am becoming. It’s because I know it’s – this is getting off topic – but I had this conversation with my fiancé a week or two ago is that the people ","P1-N400162":"that I hate most right now in my life that I’m having major problems with is my family.
THERAPIST: It doesn’t sound like your aunt and uncle and cousins were the only people that you want to shut off.
CLIENT: No. I don’t.
THERAPIST: You’re really angry at your parents.
CLIENT: I am.
THERAPIST: Maybe you’re most angry at your parents since they were in charge in most protecting you.
CLIENT: Well I am angry at them. I really am. You know, because I do feel like my whole life I put on a happy face when I wasn’t happy. And then will I miss my parents when they go some day? Absolutely. You know, but right now I have to, you know; it’s like what we talked about. It’s ","P1-N400381":"really difficult shining them off. It really is. Because they are in that close inner circle. And you know, I’ve had this conversation with my mother and I told them if my father ever purchased my grandmother’s house, I told them I would never speak to them again. I would never associate ","P1-N400382":"with them. I told them they’d never see their grandchildren because that part of my life was so hurtful and so emotionally draining to me and emotionally hurtful that everything that I’ve ever gotten from my grandmother I’m getting rid of to get it out of my life because I don’t ","P1-N400383":"want to remember her. Because it’s just an extremely bad memory that I have.
THERAPIST: Well not to be too cute about it, but one thing you knocking your grandmother; it’s your father.
CLIENT: Well, oh, I understand that. But you know, just the way you know moving forward. Like I’ve been talking about if I have to move forward without those people in my life, you know, I’m fully committing to do that. And I think the threat to my mother, you know, kind of sunk in because ","P1-N4003E1":"she started crying. And she started to understand like where I’m coming from. And I don’t know if my dad thinks my threat is serious or not. But they’ll understand it when I don’t speak to them, when I have no contact with them because that’s just the type of person I am. ","P1-N4003E2":"It’s just…I’ve just been hurt too many times by the same people that I can’t hide it anymore. I can’t hide my frustration. I can’t hide my anger. I can’t hide my misery at the thought of just seeing how uncomfortable it is for me. It really does; it bothers ","P1-N4003E3":"me and I don’t know if it’s because I’ve grown up in such a negative environment where that’s been brought on me, but that’s how I feel. I don’t…I don’t want anything to do with a lot of people, you know. I’d rather move on and start my own life ","P1-N4003E4":"and that’s what I’m trying to do. I’m trying to move on and move away from all this negativity.
THERAPIST: You really desperately want to communicate with them.
CLIENT: I do. I really do. [Phone rings.]
THERAPIST: Sorry about that. I mean really desperately. And it seems like how you feel. I’m not questioning your judgment on this; that the only way that you can communicate this and have influence over them is to, you know, break off from them. That there’s no other way to get through to them.
CLIENT: That’s how I feel because I feel like I’ve tried everything. I feel like I’ve pleaded my case. I feel like I’ve tried to have a conversation and it always well this, this, and this happens. And then, you know, ultimately I end up caving and go because I do have that emotional ","P1-N4004A1":"attachment to them. But I think I may have, you know, started climbing, starting moving a new arrow when I finally didn’t go to my cousin’s wedding. And I think that was the first step in getting to my father; getting him just to pretend to hear me a little bit because we had a conversation ","P1-N4004A2":"in the car about how I told him I wasn’t going and he was very upset and it was a screaming match.
THERAPIST: What were you screaming about?
CLIENT: About how I didn’t like him. How I’m tired of supporting behavior like this. How I’m tired of people constantly using us and doing everything, you know, to hurt us. And I have to continually put on a happy face and pretend that everything’s okay, that we’re one ","P1-N4004E1":"big happy family. I said I’m not doing it anymore. I’m not doing it. And I go if you don’t like it, that’s too fucking bad. Excuse my language.
THERAPIST: That’s okay.
CLIENT: You know, but it really…it really pissed me off and it really, you know, I hope he finally understood where I’m coming from. And I hope that with this new conversation maybe I’ll open his ears a little bit more about how bad this was; how bad, you know, he let this get to be ","P1-N400541":"when he could have controlled it. He chose not to. And instead it just expanded and expanded and expanded and now it’s expanded so much that I can’t do it anymore. I can’t do it anymore. I’m not putting on a happy face. I’m not hiding my emotions. I’m not hiding my ","P1-N400542":"feelings. I really; I can’t do it anymore.
THERAPIST: Do you feel like when you’re describing this, do you feel like I understand where your decisions are coming from?
CLIENT: To an extent. Not fully.
THERAPIST: What’s the not fully part?
CLIENT: Because you haven’t lived it. You haven’t been through the events that I’ve been through. It’s like we talk about, you know, even with my mother and my siblings. It’s people like yourself are on the outside hearing stories that are coming. They’re not the ","P1-N4005E1":"ones that have actually lived it. They are not the ones that were actually hurt by the events. They’re not the ones that were actually, their lives were affected by the events.
THERAPIST: What does it mean to sort of be on the outside?
CLIENT: What does it mean?
THERAPIST: Yeah, you’re saying that you know people like me who haven’t been through it.
CLIENT: Basically, you know, it’s…they’re the people that know the some of the facts; not all the facts. They’re the ones that, you know, for all I know are putting on a happy face trying to figure out why we’re so angry at people for no reason when we’ve been perceived ","P1-N4006A1":"as the bad people for all this time. You know, and it is; it’s frustrating because I do feel that people just don’t understand my side of the story; how everything I say is just, you know, whatever.
THERAPIST: I do get the sense, at times, when you’re communicating to me what you’re feeling that you’re almost pleading your case to me.
CLIENT: I’m just trying to get somebody to listen.
THERAPIST: Yeah, well that’s what I want to talk about. Trying to understand what you feel I don’t understand and maybe there’s something for us to understand in that. I can understand you’re hurt and your pain and how deeply betrayed you feel by the people who were supposed ","P1-N400701":"to take care of you.
CLIENT: Well it’s, I mean for me it’s just difficult because those are people that are supposed to do that. Those are the people that are supposed to love you, who are supposed to care for you unconditionally. And I guess my issues are that I’ve never felt like that, especially in ","P1-N400741":"the last 10 – 15 years, I never felt that unconditional love. I never felt that they always had my back. I always felt that they were always attacking me. They were always beating me up and beating me up and beating me up and I kept getting up and taking it. Because that’s pretty much what ","P1-N400742":"I was told to do at a young age was it’s okay; just move forward. Turn the other cheek and take it on the other side and it’ll get better as you get older.
THERAPIST: Do you feel like I can’t relate to the feeling of desperation?
CLIENT: Not to the desperation that I felt.
THERAPIST: How do you know?
CLIENT: I don’t. I just assume you don’t. And that’s what…that’s what I’ve been doing is, you know, I felt like…in reality I felt like I’ve been on my own for a long time.
THERAPIST: But then assuming that other people can’t understand the pain that you’re growing through, then you continue to be alone.
CLIENT: Uh huh.
THERAPIST: I think I understand the feelings of desperation, even if I didn’t have the same experience growing up.
CLIENT: I mean I just…I just look back on it and know, you know, how difficult it was just yelling for help and crying for help and just not getting it; being constantly denied. You know, I think – you know, and this comes back to when I overdosed on cocaine I think that was me reaching ","P1-N4008C1":"out trying to get them to help me; to understand what I was going through. And did they get it? Not at first. Not at first. I mean my mother got it a little bit, but my dad was more mad that I was selling drugs and doing drugs in his house. He didn’t even ask why I was doing drugs. Didn’t ","P1-N4008C2":"even care about the hurt that I was going through.
THERAPIST: Move forward with?
CLIENT: Not seeing anybody. Eliminating everybody from my life, you know. All the people that hurt me. All the people that, you know, who keep telling me to turn the other cheek. I don’t want that. I don’t want you to keep telling me to turn the other cheek. I’ve already done it. I ","P1-N4009E1":"don’t like it.
THERAPIST: Do you feel like those are your only two options? To turn the other cheek or to sort of erase them from your life?
CLIENT: Yes. Yes, because that’s all I, you know, I feel I’ve been taught. I feel I’ve been programmed to do. It’s to turn the other cheek and take it and deal with everything that’s going on. Or isolate yourself, move forward with nobody in it. And it’s just who I am.
THERAPIST: I wonder if there’s a middle ground; a middle ground. I mean turn the other cheek seems to me like it means, you know, ignoring your feelings or stopping your feelings or something like that. And it seems to me that there might be a way to appreciate that your feelings are valid and ","P1-N400A61":"not necessarily let go of them to have them, but just sort of be…not be, go along with the system but at least be there in the kind of way that it feels good for you and not be available in the kind of way it doesn’t feel good.
CLIENT: Yeah, but I don’t feel that whatever system I’m putting is going to be good because it all comes back to the communication where I try to communicate my side, my feelings, and for me they just keep getting rejected. It’s been like that for a lot of years. Whether it’s ","P1-N400A81":"my parents rejecting me; it’s aunts, uncles, cousins. I just feel like I’ve been rejected over and over and over and over. And nothing’s changed. It’s like the job search again. Everything I do and worked hard for, I just kept getting the reject button.
THERAPIST: You got a job.
CLIENT: I did. I did. You know, that’s part of the positive that I do want because I got the job by myself. I did not have anybody help me like I did before. Nothing was handed to me. And this is what helped me build who I’ve become; helping rebuild who I’ve become. It’s an independent ","P1-N400AE1":"person and that’s why I like the road that I’m living now; the path that I’m taking because there are a lot of positives. And there is good communication where I feel everybody understands what’s going on where with my family I don’t think anybody understands what’s ","P1-N400AE2":"going on. I feel nobody listens to anybody. And it starts from my dad. You know, if he doesn’t want to listen, why should anybody else listen? My mom doesn’t want to listen. Why should anybody else listen?
THERAPIST: Is that why you think people on the outside can understand?
CLIENT: Most of the time, yes. Because those are the two people in your life that are supposed to listen to you. They’re supposed to back you up. They’re supposed to protect you. And I don’t feel that I got that to the best of their ability. I don’t. I feel like I was just left ","P1-N400B21":"there, abandoned, you know, emotionally. I feel emotionally they abandoned me on more than one occasion. They weren’t that support system that I really needed. And looking back on it, it bothers me.
THERAPIST: Needed and craved.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: And you still crave it.
CLIENT: Uh huh. I still do. I just want to be heard from them, by them. And I feel like everything I do is not heard from them. They don’t hear me. I mean perfect examples; getting a job on my own. My mother, the first thing she does it slam it; negative. No positive in it. Buying an engagement ","P1-N400BC1":"ring without them having any involvement. First thing they do is criticize and slam me. Positives; should be excited about turn in to negatives like that. Don’t hear me until I have to blow up and explain to them what’s going on and then they finally get it. It bothers me. Listen to me the ","P1-N400BC2":"first time. Be happy for me because I know that first reaction is how they really feel.
THERAPIST: Why do you think they’re afraid of letting go?
CLIENT: I don’t know. I still think they want to…I still think they think we’re kids and that they need to protect us always and make decisions for us.
THERAPIST: And then the irony is you don’t feel protected at all.
CLIENT: No. I don’t. I don’t feel like they’re helping me at all or protecting me or putting me in the safest environment. I don’t feel that at all. And I don’t know how my siblings feel, but I don’t feel that way. I think also is I think they’re trying to make ","P1-N400CC1":"up for their mistakes. It’s too late. You know, they’re trying to back track. They’re trying to be there for us now, when I needed them then. And it bothers me because now all of a sudden after everything is played out, you’ve seen the mistakes. You’ve seen where we are ","P1-N400CC2":"emotionally, and now you’re trying to back track it to try to move forward and be a part of our lives and actually defend us. That’s what bothers me the most. Why is it now that when we take action, they finally hear us?
THERAPIST: That’s good to hear. We need to stop.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I will see you next week.
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: Okay. I look forward to the next one.
CLIENT: Thank you Dr. [inaudible – 44:55].
THERAPIST: Okay, bye bye.
CLIENT: Bye.
