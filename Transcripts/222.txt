DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her job hunt and how she gets angry when rejected from a job or interview. Client feels entitled to things from people she does not know, but does not feel entitled when she has a relationship with someone.
CLIENT: [inaudible 00:03:43]. I [inaudible 00:04:16] a lot of jobs and they [inaudible 00:04:21] getting rejection, like it’s kind of really pissing me off because I feel like I’m kind of over qualified for these jobs. But then rejection letters [inaudible 00:04:33]. “We’ve found ","P1-N4000B1":"other candidates that are more qualified than you.” And I’m applying to like mid-level two positions or whatever I used to do [inaudible 00:04:46]. So I feel a little bit, kind of dismayed.
THERAPIST: You get really angry.
CLIENT: Yeah. Because you know.
THERAPIST: It’s like they’re challenging you and you feel very angry they’re challenging you.
CLIENT: Could be.
THERAPIST: You see it as a challenge.
CLIENT: Yeah. But how else should I see it? [Laughs] [Pause]
THERAPIST: Well they’re evaluating whether you’re a good fit. They’re not trying to pick a fight with you.
CLIENT: [Laughs] Yeah. I know. That’s just like bull shit. “Are you a good fit?” You know? What the hell does that mean? I guess like my resume is, I think, stellar. It’s pretty decent. So it’s like…I don’t know. [Laughs] I’m not mad at the way that’s ","P1-N400291":"interviewing me. It’s just a bit weird that we’ve had three phone interviews just like they’re still in, “ [inaudible 00:10:55], bring your [inaudible 00:10:53].” I’m like, “What?” I mean I’ve never had that. Like I’ve only had face-to-face ","P1-N400292":"interviews. So it’s just a bit weird to me, but I’m not angry at them because I get that they…both of us need to know whether we’re a good fit or not. But like people who are turning me down for jobs that I’ve already done. Like I’ve done them at a managerial level ","P1-N400293":"as well. You know, like the [inaudible 00:11:20] level.
THERAPIST: I’m just struck by how many feelings this evokes for you.
CLIENT: Yeah. I cannot be [inaudible 00:12:18] emotional a lot for some reason. I don’t know. [Pause] But I do this sort of stuff on like a weekly basis or as a volunteer and at other places. So I feel like I might as well get paid for this. I guess I’ve been trying not to care so much and ","P1-N4002F1":"focus on the positives, the acceptance, and the interviews rather than the rejection.
THERAPIST: What do you mean?
CLIENT: Well, you know, like I feel like [inaudible 00:14:31] doesn’t really care and I have rationalized it and have made myself not care that he doesn’t care. You know. So. But I’m not like freaking out about it for some reason. I’m just like not thinking about it. So. Just ","P1-N400371":"keep to my regular friends and that’s what it is.
THERAPIST: [inaudible 00:20:34] I’m talking about sort of something that you’re entitled to, like these jobs. That you deserve them because you’re qualified and angry that they’ve…you’re being overlooked. To kind of feeling like…I don’t know. Kind of you’re ","P1-N400491":"covering your face?
CLIENT: No. [laughs]
THERAPIST: Is it hard to hear me say this?
CLIENT: No. [laughs] It was just…I just had my hand on my mouth. It looks weird. I’m not covering what I’m saying. [laughs]
THERAPIST: To just feeling like you don’t have much. You know, [inaudible 00:21:06]. He’s not very much a friend has is wonderful [inaudible 00:21:10].
CLIENT: Sorry. What did you say?
THERAPIST: Well feeling like then you don’t have much. Feeling kind of pathetic and have very much…
CLIENT: Yeah. [laughs] Well I’m not trying to have the victim’s attitude. I don’t know. I definitely feel like I don’t have what my friend has. I don’t know. In terms of a relationship [inaudible 00:21:42] like one person making her completely happy. And I do think when ","P1-N400571":"she said that, I thought, “Well I’ve been there and that’s like a fallacy.”
THERAPIST: Maybe and also somehow that they’re related.
CLIENT: How are they related?
THERAPIST: I’m not sure.
CLIENT: [inaudible 00:24:12]. Well is it unhealthy to feel entitled?
THERAPIST: Yeah. I think it’s a problem.
CLIENT: [inaudible 00:24:32].
THERAPIST: Yeah. I absolutely think it’s a problem.
CLIENT: Oh why?
THERAPIST: To feel that people owe you things. I think that’s a problem. I do. Especially people who have no relationship to you.
CLIENT: Well, I don’t know. [laughs] I don’t know what to say to that. [laughs] [pause] I guess it comes from the feeling of lack maybe, but I don’t know. I don’t know why I go there and get into that mode. [pause] Yeah. I don’t know.
THERAPIST: No. It really isn’t.
CLIENT: It’s not like, you know, a healthy dose of pride or anything?
THERAPIST: No, because they haven’t done anything to you. Being angry implies that they’ve done something to you. [pause] A healthy dose of pride is, “Well since I have these talents, someone will recognize them. It didn’t work out with this group.” Sense of pride doesn’t ","P1-N4007B1":"necessarily lead you to be angry with people for not giving you what you think you deserve.
CLIENT: Well, I don’t know. Maybe someone who already has a job and is looking for jobs while they already have a job might not feel angry, because they’re more secure. But someone who’s looking for jobs after two years of not working full-time, may feel kind of scared and anxious.
THERAPIST: Like you?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: We have to think about why that leads to anger.
CLIENT: Actually when I get angry, I just feel judged and compared to and from lack of…and deny everywhere. I guess I take it more personally than I should.
THERAPIST: It can get very personal.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Very, very personal. You said like they’re attacking you.
CLIENT: [laughs]
THERAPIST: And they’re telling you, “You’re shit. You’re application’s shit and we don’t want you.”
CLIENT: [laughs] [inaudible 00:30:12] [pause] I guess it’s also something that I’m proud of. I mean I take pride in and not getting my due I feel. It’s like I’m not getting my due and yeah. “Don’t invite me for an interview.” [laughs] [pause]
THERAPIST: Well that’s just it. Somehow that it just is such a blow to you.
CLIENT: Yeah. [pause] Yeah. I think it’s mostly that I think this is something I can do really well and they don’t think so. And I take that as a blow and like I take that very personally and I just have to learn to detach myself from it and kind of realize that I don’t know what they ","P1-N400971":"need. They might have put an ad out, but maybe it wasn’t as well written. Maybe I meant something and that…you know? I mean there really are candidates. Maybe it’s fine. Maybe they want to hire someone they know, you know? So what. [inaudible 00:33:08] impasses [inaudible 00:33:13].
THERAPIST: I mean they may…I mean there’s eight million reasons why companies don’t hire particular people than others. They may want someone who has continued work experience in the field.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: They maybe learned either that you couldn’t get a job or what’s the truth is, is you didn’t want a job because you were doing other things. I’m sure they don’t want to hire someone ideally who’s going to work for them for a year and leave and do the things ","P1-N4009D1":"they’d rather do. They’d rather hire someone who wants a career in this field, which you don’t.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And those needs are different. It has nothing to do about what you can and can’t do. It’s not a performance. It’s about their needs and their interests in having someone who wants to do this job.
CLIENT: Yeah. [inaudible 00:34:17] think about it that way. [laughs] [pause]
THERAPIST: I’m making sort of very direct, strong statements about this because I do think this is a problem for you. It creates a dynamic for you, where you see people very hostilely. And you see them as hostile to you.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I think you could have space for other feelings.
CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like that is many scenarios.
THERAPIST: [inaudible 00:35:42].
CLIENT: [inaudible 00:35:44] the department [inaudible 00:35:46] teaching next semester and [inaudible 00:35:48]. I’m like really mad at them for other things, but things like this and I guess I’m realizing now that this is [inaudible 00:35:58] where I feel like I’m being denied something ","P1-N400B11":"I was entitled to or whatever, you know. Whereas, it’s like irrational kind of thinking on everyone’s part [inaudible 00:36:12] or just other things going on. Instead of them being like taking away some things that I feel I’m entitled to.
THERAPIST: When you feel you’re entitled to and you feel like when you’re not given it, it’s such a personal attack.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean that’s…I feel like that creates so much distress for you. I imagine 99.5 percent of the time someone is preoccupied. They’ve other things to do. Who knows?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But you take it as a statement on you and then you want to take them on.
CLIENT: [laughs]
THERAPIST: And it occupies a lot of your mental and emotional space that could quite frankly be spent on other things.
CLIENT: [laughs]
THERAPIST: Like your creative endeavors. [pause]
CLIENT: Well at least I don’t feel like this in every area…or I think I don’t. [laughs]
THERAPIST: When you say that, are you feeling badly about having my pointing this out?
CLIENT: No. No. I’m actually very grateful and I know this will help me grow. But I’m just wondering like how and what scenario like do I act this way because are there other areas where I’m more blasé, more Zen about accepting things that don’t come my way? And if so, maybe ","P1-N400C91":"I can bring that thing of Zen out into other areas.
THERAPIST: That sounds [inaudible 00:38:30].
CLIENT: [laughs] Like I guess what I was trying to say earlier, like I don’t care that [inaudible 00:38:40] doesn’t care or doesn’t seem to me to care or doesn’t care in the way that I understand care. I feel like I’m okay with that just the way that I rationalize it. I ","P1-N400CD1":"rationalize it or I have other people in my life who care the way that I want them to care, and that makes it okay that he doesn’t care. You know?
THERAPIST: Have you asked him?
CLIENT: Yeah. He was like, “I don’t know. I’m just don’t feel sexual these days.” He’s very…he’s been very busy, but I don’t know. We were watching this movie in which this guy is like addicted to porn and he [inaudible 00:40:05] that and work for ","P1-N400D31":"every day. There’s a time [inaudible 00:40:11] when they get back.
THERAPIST: I thought he can, but it’s hard for him to maintain. He can’t get one at all?
CLIENT: Well depends. Like when he’s not feeling sexual, I guess he probably can then…if he does, it lasts very short. I’m just curious. [laughs] his sexuality [inaudible 00:41:06] think about it. [pause] Yes. And another thing that I don’t get and it’s like, it’s ","P1-N400D91":"[inaudible 00:41:32] really do it, but I’m attracted to him for whatever reason and I met Terry, but I’m not attracted…[laughs] I guess that happens. That’s not uncommon. It’s just, you know, ironic. [Pause]
THERAPIST: When I was asking you before whether it was hard to hear my feedback and you said you’re grateful. I was glad to hear that because I want to help you with this. This is not coming from a place of judgment. This is coming from a place of concern in seeing that you’re using your ","P1-N400DB1":"very wonderful energies in ways that are not useful to you and you’re making yourself feel badly.
CLIENT: Yeah. Thank you. [laughs] I feel that definitely. [pause] Yeah. because I was a bit concerned only just like that [inaudible 00:42:40] had said exactly what [inaudible 00:42:47].
THERAPIST: These words being…
CLIENT: What did she say? You know, a whole bunch of…you know like persons and all that. And then she also said like, “No one owes you anything. The truth is no one owes you anything [inaudible 00:43:02]” I don’t know what she meant by that. Maybe she picked up on like my sense ","P1-N400E11":"of when [inaudible 00:43:16]. I’m trying to understand why or how like [inaudible 00:43:19] a doctor. She knew of a place where I could stay and write. And I said thank you and I paid for the utilities.
THERAPIST: I’m glad you know that. I’m glad you do.
CLIENT: Yeah. It can be very scary because you hear the same words coming out of your mouth. [laughs] [inaudible 00:44:22] them. [laughs]
THERAPIST: Well, I don’t know where that came from, from her. It could just be words. It could be that she was picking up on something about you, maybe about…for me, it comes from a place of caring and concern.
CLIENT: Yeah. [ laughs] Okay. [pause] [inaudible 00:45:01]. They don’t understand. Like I don’t feel entitled to sex. I don’t feel entitled to caring. Maybe that’s just the dynamic of dating. You don’t allow yourself to go there. So I’m just trying to take that knowledge ","P1-N400EB1":"and bring it here. Why do I feel entitled to a job?
THERAPIST: It’s the counterpoint to what I was thinking of when you were taking about sort of this feeling entitled bad. And my thought that I didn’t share is maybe feeling entitle to some things isn’t bad. Like should you be entitled to feel cared for? Should you feel entitled to ","P1-N400ED1":"be respected? Some things to feel entitled for maybe aren’t bad.
CLIENT: Oh. [laughs] Just like the opposite. Like I should feel entitled to be cared for and have sex with, but not feel entitled for a job, a total stranger.
THERAPIST: Maybe.
CLIENT: [Laughs]
THERAPIST: It speaks in part to the context of the relationship. It made me think about how that woman from long ago, who didn’t do the interview that you wanted her to do, when she was supposed to write it up.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.
THERAPIST: And feeling very angry at her and how you tend to feel entitled to get things from people you don’t know very well. As if there’s sort of this implicit obligation between you and another person whom you really don’t have a relationship with or maybe not much of one versus ","P1-N400F91":"people that you actually are in very close contact with, with people by definition of being in a relationship have obligations to each other.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I see that. But I really don’t want to like feel entitled to things in a relationship.
THERAPIST: Because?
CLIENT: I don’t know. I don’t know if I have the knack to kind of demand what I want. Maybe I have been very demanding and it went badly and I hated that person that I became when I was demanding.
THERAPIST: Or maybe it’s now safe for you to demand things from people you don’t know very well.
CLIENT: Yeah. [laughs]
THERAPIST: That’s something to talk about for sure. Well we need to stop, but I’ll see you tomorrow. Right? At 10 o’clock.
CLIENT: Ten?
THERAPIST: At ten.
CLIENT: Sorry I didn’t respond. I thought I did.
THERAPIST: Don’t worry. I figured you also…well you said the morning anyway. I figured that, that would work for you. So I have you down for them.
CLIENT: Yeah. I will actually.
THERAPIST: Okay. So I have you down for 10.
CLIENT: Have a good day.
THERAPIST: Thank you very much.
