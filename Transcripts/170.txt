THERAPIST: Hi! Come on in!
CLIENT: I’m trying to remember what we talked about on Monday.
THERAPIST: Sometimes when you say things that are especially painful, you giggle.
CLIENT: Oh, I don’t know if it’s painful. Is it painful? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Feeling neglected... Usually feeling neglected doesn’t come with warm, happy thoughts. [00:12:20]
CLIENT: (chuckles) No, I just feel silly. I feel like, “Why am I feeling this way? It’s silly!”
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: There is no rationality for it. I mean, it’s irrational, so... That’s why I’m giggling.
THERAPIST: Because you feel silly.
CLIENT: (inaudible)
THERAPIST: Because you feel silly for having these feelings? (client affirms) (pause) What’s silly about those feelings?
CLIENT: They’re irrational. There is no need to feel neglected at that moment, you know. In fact, I was invited and like, like you say, you know like, I am wanted, so I should... feel that. (chuckles) instead of... an outsider. I could even take it a step further in a positive direction and be ","P1-N400331":"like, “I am the prodigal son!” How much more like, joy does the father bring to the prodigal son? I always like, rooted for the son who was around, in that story. (chuckles) Like, what... I’ll bet that guy feels so bitter. (chuckles) He’s been around and he’s done everything, ","P1-N400332":"and the dad is all about like, the son who runs away, didn’t, you know, didn’t give a fuck, you know? But, you know, people are like, “That’s not the point of the story. The point of the story... is, you know like, the dad’s love for... (chuckles) (sighs) Yeah. I mean, ","P1-N400333":"it wasn’t like, intense like, those feelings, but... maybe because I was cognizant of them, and I was trying to question them. Like, “Why do I feel weird and...” You know...
THERAPIST: Hmm. Does it feel like only one person gets it?
CLIENT: Well like, at one time. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I don’t know what that means. Someone can only love one child at a time?
CLIENT: (chuckles) (pause) No, only one person can talk at one time.
THERAPIST: Okay. Is that what love is? Talking? [00:18:55]
CLIENT: I mean, it’s a performance. It’s like, the show of talent.
THERAPIST: I’m... I’ve lost you.
CLIENT: What?
THERAPIST: I’ve lost you. I’m not sure I follow.
CLIENT: But I mean like... yeah, love. Like, isn’t that like... a performance of your... talents and like... to show how good you are, or something.
THERAPIST: (pause) That’s what love feels like to you?
CLIENT: Sometimes, you know, and...
THERAPIST: (pause) That someone can’t love you unless like, you’re performing for them? [00:19:49]
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I guess like... I don’t know. (pause) But like you know like... like affection. Like, David is affectionate when, you know, when he finds me cute. He’s like, “Oh, you’re so cute and you’re...” Then he might, maybe, give me a hug. So that’s ","P1-N4005B1":"something I’m doing, I feel (chuckles), I’m being cute. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: When he... when he gives you a hug, are you aware of consciously being cute, so you get a hug?
CLIENT: Well, no, there is a rationality behind that hug, you know. Like, I’ve earned it because I’m being cute. (pause) Yeah, I don’t know. And like Nelson might hug me, because I’m sexy or I’m being sexy at that moment. You know so that’s like... there is (chuckles), ","P1-N4005F1":"you know, that... yeah. So... [00:21:06]
THERAPIST: And when they’re not hugging you, then they’re not, they don’t have feelings for you?
CLIENT: Hmm, well... they’re just busy. (chuckles) Or ignoring me, I guess... to get stuff done. (chuckles), which is okay.
THERAPIST: But does that... I guess I’m... you’re equating feelings and behavior. So I’m trying to understand; if they’re not behaving a particular way towards you, their feelings have gone, in your mind.
CLIENT: Yeah, sometimes.
THERAPIST: (affirms) Like you’ve fallen off their radar. (client affirms)
CLIENT: I don’t know. That’s what I think like... in a group setting like, that and like... I guess everyone does that, but you know, you’re constantly trying to think of something funny to say, or something interesting... so people, you know like, you’re on the radar, you know ","P1-N4006D1":"like... so... (pause) I don’t know, at least I’ll be helpful, you know?
THERAPIST: (pause) But it also makes me think about how it’s so important for you to get reactions from people, and as you said, getting a negative reaction is better than no reaction. I’m thinking about why that is, and how it’s hard in the absence of immediate feedback or reaction ","P1-N400711":"or behavior, you feel very unloved and uncared for. (client responds) Like you’re not even registering for the other person.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know why that is. (chuckles) (therapist affirms)
THERAPIST: You’re bringing up an important piece about what that, the interpretation you give to the lack of interaction. (client affirms) That has a very particular type of interpretation. It’s very negative.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Well, that that lack of interaction feels like you’ve sort of fallen off the end of the earth, that if someone isn’t giving you attention or focused on you, you don’t really feel like you’ve registered for them or present for them emotionally. Like, if a parent were ","P1-N4007D1":"focused on, you know, your sibling and whatever they were doing, you know that somehow you would not be loved anymore, that they would be the one who would be winning the love. (client responds) And it’s very hard to function in that experience. (client responds) [00:29:15]
CLIENT: (pause) Well, I mean, I’m trying to replace that by thinking that my turn will come. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well, that’s one way. I mean, certainly that’s one way of thinking about it. (client affirms) But it still leaves some insecurity, because you’re waiting for your turn, versus just feeling that... it’s always your turn, in a sense. It’s not your turn to always ","P1-N400811":"be the focus, but it’s your turn, because you’re present in someone’s mind, even if you’re not, you know, physically present with them or have their attention. (client responds)
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I should have, but (chuckles)...
THERAPIST: You should feel that way if your hypothesis is true.
CLIENT: (responds) (pause) I mean, it was performance driven. Like, my dad would be (inaudible) just say, you know, “Study hard, that’s all we want from you.” You know just like, “Get the highest marks,” and stuff and like... And I couldn’t, because (chuckles) I guess ","P1-N4008B1":"I was, you know, sad as a child and you know like... I didn’t want to study and... you know, I just wanted to read novels. (pause) Yeah. So... then I just, I guess I reasoned that, you know, “Okay, so I’m not loved, because I didn’t study hard.” (chuckles) So... [00:32:35]
THERAPIST: But that’s locating the problem inside you and not inside (ph) him.
CLIENT: Yeah. My mom did love me, she does love me, but she didn’t have the training to be like... overtly affectionate or like, you know like, vocalize her love. But she was herself, you know like... troubled (chuckles) with, you know, all the things that were going on. So she didn’t have ","P1-N4008F1":"the wherewithal to be effusive and, you know like, positive and loving, so...
THERAPIST: That’s very true.
CLIENT: (pause) So I guess I do have like, a performance-driven idea of love, that... you know, the brighter you shine, the better you do something, the more love you’re going to get, you know. [00:33:43]
THERAPIST: You have a performance-driven idea of a lot of things.
CLIENT: A lot of things?
THERAPIST: Self-esteem, too. You know, you feel good about yourself when you accomplish the sentence and this... (client affirms) You are very much, you’re very organized around being performance driven (client chuckles), which I guess, you know, is adaptive to the extent that it gives you the ","P1-N400991":"feeling of having control. (client affirms) (pause) But it also chronically leaves you feeling frustrated.
CLIENT: (responds) (pause) Yeah, and it’s like incredible to me when that doesn’t work and makes me fucking frustrated (chuckles) so frustrated. Like, last night like, they were talking about movies. This woman, you know, who I feel is so loved, is just like, naming all these movies that ","P1-N4009B1":"are like shit! I’m like... And I’m not, I’m being nice, I’m smiling and nodding, but in my head, I’m rolling my eyes! I’m like, “Are you seri , like... You have no taste!” (chuckles) [00:34:53]
THERAPIST: (pause) Well, you’re in a group, and you think about what some of these people in the group have that you don’t have (client affirms), in terms of people in your life, and you miss the fact that you’re with a group of people (client chuckles), and you’re in that group.
CLIENT: (responds) (pause) I try to not miss it, I mean like... I know that like, you have to build stuff, I’ve learned that. Instead of looking out constantly, I’m starting to think about looking in. (chuckles) And maybe also looking in... I mean, I was only going to stay there for an hour, ","P1-N400A51":"but I ended up staying there for... you know, two hours and a half, so it’s like... so I must have felt invested, I wasn’t just like, there for like... “Oh, this is going to be pinpricks all along. Let’s just, you know, get tortured.” It wasn’t like that (therapist ","P1-N400A52":"affirms), you know. [00:39:16]
THERAPIST: Because you feel it needs to be a competition.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t like that. I want to change that but, you know... (therapist affirms) I mean, I don’t think I’ll be like that where, I’m like, “Oh, yay, you have a family, yes! Good for you!” That’s fake! (chuckles) You know. I’ll still feel sad ","P1-N400AF1":"and I think that’s legitimate, that I’ll feel sad that I don’t have that, because everyone should want it, or have it, or something, you know? (therapist affirms) But it shouldn’t be like, a hierarchy or you know like, I shouldn’t (inaudible) like, find a high horse pronto ","P1-N400AF2":"and climb on it! (chuckles) you know? (therapist affirms) [00:41:41]
THERAPIST: (pause) Well, you feel that there are some things in finite quantities, like love. There is only so much love, and the more a sibling gets, the less another sibling gets. (client affirms) And there is only so much good feeling and someone gets, you know, the positive feelings, then there ","P1-N400B11":"is none leftover. So it’s kind of a way of thinking that’s sort of organized around scarcity.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Why is that? (pause) I don’t know. I feel like, because there was like, scarcity when I was growing up, you know? (therapist affirms) Like, I could count the number of days when my dad was positive.
THERAPIST: But the scarcity had much more to do with what was inside or not inside him, not about what other people were or weren’t getting. (client responds) But it sort of morphed, for you, into sort of feeling like... a distribution of resources or mis-distribution rather than just sort of a lack. [00:43:00]
CLIENT: (responds) (pause) I mean, I feel the same way about David also.
THERAPIST: How do you mean?
CLIENT: Maybe there was a scarcity of love. There was only a little bit to be had, so like, I’ll do something you know like, whatever to like, get it. (therapist responds) Then it wasn’t like, this like, long... unending like... you know, expanse of time and togetherness that could be, you ","P1-N400BB1":"know, enjoyed no matter when or where. (chuckles) Obviously not, because (chuckles) you know, yeah, that will mean that we were happy together and we were, we are still together. (chuckles) But I feel that way with like... Nelson, too, now I feel it. I’m starting to, and that’s starting to scare me.
THERAPIST: Well, Shilpee... (client affirms) we need to stop for today. So I’ll see you on Monday.
CLIENT: Yeah, thank you. Have a good weekend.
THERAPIST: Thank you. (pause) Bye.
CLIENT: Stay warm! (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Thank you. You, too!
