THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.
THERAPIST: I'm sorry you had so much difficulty. God.
THERAPIST: Hi.
THERAPIST: A little odd [for the police officers] (ph).
THERAPIST: Oh, did he...? It wasn't...?
THERAPIST: I (ph)...
THERAPIST: Okay, great. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Yes.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Is that what you guys talked about after you left?
THERAPIST: Is that...? When did that shift? Because you guys were fight... when did it shift to you comforting Marlene?
THERAPIST: What changed in you from being upset to going to comfort her?
THERAPIST: And that made a big difference?
THERAPIST: What...? [Something else] (ph)... what do you think...? Oh, are you done with this?
THERAPIST: That's your... I'll take the forms, and this is yours. Thank you.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, do you feel, Steve, you're making more of an effort to spend time with Marlene? [0:03:59]
THERAPIST: Well, do you feel...? Because it sounds like, Marlene, you felt there was a difference between this past week and the week before. Do you feel there was as big a difference, or do you feel that... in terms of how much time you spent together?
THERAPIST: I guess what I'm trying to understand is, it's... from Marlene's vantage point it seemed like you made a different kind of effort. So I was wondering whether it just felt like it was just a change in the week or you felt that it was something different on your part.
THERAPIST: You felt you could talk to her versus what? What is not feeling like you can talk to her?
THERAPIST: Well, I'm glad this week was a better week for you guys. And I want to take up with what you were saying in terms of arguing with... arguing better or arguing less or both?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. The acknowledging part...
THERAPIST: It seems like was a big difference.
THERAPIST: Did it feel different for you, too?
THERAPIST: Well, it also sounds like... I guess I'm wondering... it seems like for you, Steve, sometimes when Marlene is upset...
THERAPIST: You feel like, oh my God, I can't say anything.
THERAPIST: Well, it's not... I mean, sometimes, I didn't mean all the time.
THERAPIST: When you feel you can't talk freely is when Marlene's just... you feel Marlene's reacting. I guess... well, let me finish the second part of my question, then you could maybe say that the way I'm thinking about it isn't right. But it seems like sometimes when Marlene's upset, you feel like, ","P1-N400A71":"oh, I have to watch everything I say. I can't sort of speak freely. And then sometimes... like, it sounds like last week when she was upset you comforted her. I mean, that's a very different reaction to... so I don't know if you just... like, it was something you thought about or you just felt it differently? ","P1-N400A72":"Do you have a thought about that?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: So I have a couple of thoughts. I'm glad to hear that you were able to work through something because you left here really in a bad place.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: Well, my one thought about watching you guys last weekend was very... or it certainly impacted... made an impact on me, is that I feel like you guys are tapping into a wound or hurt so deep. Like, it just feels so deep.
THERAPIST: It's not like, just give me some space, you know (chuckling)?
THERAPIST: It's so deep for both of you. I was giving the example for you. Like, it's just... that's what really stayed with me. And I don't know what these wounds are and why they go so deep? I'm not sure, but that's sort of the impression it made on me.
THERAPIST: Do you feel like it's more than just the last three or four years?
THERAPIST: It's okay.
THERAPIST: (Sneezing) Excuse me.
THERAPIST: Thank you (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Where do you feel like that's coming from in you?
THERAPIST: Hmm. And what's that hate about?
THERAPIST: I see. I was just... you were saying there's such hate, and then you were saying, my parents (ph)...
THERAPIST: With your parents, what similarity were you drawing?
THERAPIST: Hmm.
THERAPIST: Hmm. Did it stay with you?
THERAPIST: But you had a sense it didn't stay with them? Or it just didn't... wasn't acknowledged?
THERAPIST: I see. And what were the fights about? Anything in particular?
THERAPIST: Huh.
THERAPIST: Do they think you should be living at home forever?
THERAPIST: Does she give you a hard time about it?
THERAPIST: Hmm.
THERAPIST: Even though she did it herself.
THERAPIST: Got it.
THERAPIST: Got it.
THERAPIST: And what you're describing in terms of them kind of wanting to control you, it sounds like it's based at least in part out of fear.
THERAPIST: Like, they don't know what's out there, and so they...
THERAPIST: I see, they're afraid for you to leave and, I don't know, get pregnant (ph).
THERAPIST: Really?
THERAPIST: Do they tend to stick to their routine and not get out of it? They're kind of scared of new stuff?
THERAPIST: Hmm. [0:17:59]
THERAPIST: To just... I'm sorry, I have allergies. To answer your question about sort of how do you fight less intensely or how do you sort of not feel like you're fighting to the end or something...
THERAPIST: And there's a couple of answers to that. I mean, one is to understand what is getting stirred up...
THERAPIST: What this immediate fight over the garbage is stirring up, right? Because it's probably... I'm giving... I guess you guys do sort of fight about chores, but I'm sort of just giving it as a...
THERAPIST: Right. So it's, like, what's at stake with...? What does this mean?
THERAPIST: This clearly... there's the... there's a text and then there's a subtext. It's, like, what's really going on, the subtitles?
THERAPIST: So that's one way to handle it. We have been, I think, starting to talk about that. Like, what's at stake in this fight? What are you guys really fighting about?
THERAPIST: And sort of understanding that I think really can help diffuse the immediate topics, that's one way. The other way, and it sounds like... these are... they're not... they can all happen at once. And this is really hard at the moment, but it sounds like you guys did it after, is try to put ","P1-N4015B1":"your hurt aside for a moment and, what is the other person trying to say to me?
THERAPIST: Like, just... and it's so hard in the heat of the moment. It's like, you're hurt is everything. It takes up your entire field of vision.
THERAPIST: There's nothing else you can see. And, if there's any way to even just move it slightly... so even if your left eye, out of the corner of your left eye you can see something else, it really makes things very, very different...
THERAPIST: Because you guys... I mean, some couples really are going out to hurt each other. [0:20:00]
THERAPIST: I mean, they are. I don't see that in you. I see that you're hearing things in a way that feels so wounding, and then maybe you can try to wound the other person out of reaction or defense at that but not because you want to be mean to each other.
THERAPIST: You guys don't want to be mean to each other.
THERAPIST: You love each other, and you want to get along better. And so it seems like when that consumes you, like it did last week, it's very hard to think outside of that.
THERAPIST: And then around that, I mean, there's often strategies to just how you stop yourself in the moment?
THERAPIST: There's sort of very basic... sort of around slowing that down rather than just reacting and being kind of consumed with your own hurt. And they're (ph) easier said and done. But some couples really find that, if they try to actually practice it, they get better when they're practicing it.
THERAPIST: So that's more of a kind of a practical approach to it.
THERAPIST: I think both are important because what's at stake in these fights I think is very important. To see the pain that each of you express, I mean, it's just... I mean, it really made a deep impact on me.
THERAPIST: Yes.
THERAPIST: I mean, in these moments, it seems like it boils down to you, Marlene, feeling so profoundly rejected...
THERAPIST: Rejected. And you, I don't know if I could put my finger on it as well with you, Steve...
THERAPIST: But maybe there's something... no. Well, but really?
THERAPIST: In terms of what?
THERAPIST: That's not necessarily a bad thing.
THERAPIST: Does it feel like it's bad sometimes? [0:22:58]
THERAPIST: Well, it's about... there's something about freedom. Like, you kept saying your free time, like, Marlene's trying to interfere with your free time and your space. And there's something about that. I mean, it was just very poignant. It was something that was just heartbreaking to you about that.
THERAPIST: Were they... did they like to kind of take your...? What...?
THERAPIST: So this was... you moved into a smaller house when your parents divorced?
THERAPIST: A townhouse?
THERAPIST: Space.
THERAPIST: You guys like biking.
THERAPIST: You know, we are going to need to stop. I'm sorry you guys didn't have much time today.
THERAPIST: I was going to ask you, so my assistant probably sent you the statement.
THERAPIST: Right? So starting from when we recorded I could charge you the $40, that's not fine... that's fine...
THERAPIST: But the sessions that... well, I don't know, maybe we can figure it out. I need to charge you a little bit more for the sessions before that?
THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah, okay. You can look it over, we'll figure...
THERAPIST: Yeah, that's fine. So starting from last week it'll just be $40 a session plus whatever the insurance gives.
THERAPIST: And then there's a few sessions in between. We'll figure something out. Does that make sense?
THERAPIST: Okay, all right, good.
THERAPIST: Oh, yeah, that first statement, so did you send that in yet?
THERAPIST: Ai (ph). But that will help... I think that will help with everything.
THERAPIST: I'll just... okay, very good. So... oh, I was going to ask you one other thing. My regular time on Tuesday... I'm... my Tuesdays keep shifting. Can you do 10:00 as a regular time, and that'll stay like that?
THERAPIST: Okay.
THERAPIST: So is that... would that not work?
THERAPIST: For next week or ongoing?
THERAPIST: Okay. So are mornings not good for you at all, or just later in the morning?
THERAPIST: So do you want to check...? So can you not do a morning time at all, or...?
THERAPIST: Okay.
THERAPIST: Right, it would be too... and you don't want an afternoon time because afternoon times weren't working?
THERAPIST: So you're ideally looking for late morning, is that correct? I'm just trying to understand what you're saying.
THERAPIST: Okay.
THERAPIST: So you wouldn't be able to come... oh, at all?
THERAPIST: I see.
THERAPIST: Okay. [0:29:55] Well, let's... so why don't we figure out next week, and then let's... because I'd like to get you guys in a regular slot. My Tuesdays are... I want to... so that we can count on that.
THERAPIST: And I'm sorry, I kept getting confused about what I have available on Tuesday morning. I do have a 2:30 on Tuesday afternoon, but that doesn't seem like that worked well for you.
THERAPIST: Okay.
THERAPIST: So can you do 10:00 next week?
THERAPIST: Is that all right?
THERAPIST: If that works for you, that will be great. Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay, so I'll see you guys, and we'll keep it at 10:00.
THERAPIST: Okay, take care. Great. Bye bye.
