DESCRIPTION: Client discusses a friend who purchased her a ticket for her to fly abroad and she is unsure how she feels about it. Client discusses a program she got into for school, but is worried she can't pay for it.
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in. (PAUSE) [00:01:00]
CLIENT: How are you?
THERAPIST: Good. Thank you. (PAUSE) [00:02:00]
CLIENT: I don’t know where to start. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) (inaudible at 00:03:57) Spring Break.
THERAPIST: Yeah? [00:03:59]
CLIENT: I thought I was going to go away so that’s why I didn’t, I canceled the session this last week. And this friend of mine, like I guess high school friend from Nepal, he said, “Oh, you should come visit me in (inaudible at 00:04:25)” and he like bought a ticket for me and ","P1-N4001D1":"stuff. (LAUGHTER) But like almost a month before my trip, like we lost touch. Like he would Skype like every day. It was like... (LAUGHTER) He was like a pest. You know? Like just as I was getting down to my work, he would ping me and insist that I talk to him and I’d talk for like half an hour ","P1-N4001D2":"sometimes, you know, longer. [00:05:01]
THERAPIST: Did you think to talk about it before in here? You were thinking about going and not sure and feeling ambivalent? [00:07:57]
CLIENT: Did I think to?
THERAPIST: Did you think about talking about it in here?
CLIENT: It wasn’t... It wasn’t on my mind then. I hadn’t brought it up. Right? Or I had?
THERAPIST: No. I just think there are so many instances where you tell me about things after the fact. But things leading up to it, you know, that it’s clear that what’s going on before something happens could be helpful to talk about and think about together. But you don’t. And it’s ","P1-N4002D1":"sort of almost mysterious. It’s like, “I’m going out of the country.” It’s very mysterious. You didn’t actually tell me anything about it.
CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: And then clearly it’s complicated. You’re not really sure if you’re going to go. But you don’t really talk about it.
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: And I guess I’m wondering why.
CLIENT: I’m not prepared. Like I don’t prepare for things. (LAUGHTER) I guess that... This is a sign of that. I didn’t really want to think about it. I didn’t want it to occupy much of my time. [00:09:05]
THERAPIST: Well, what does a big deal mean? What (inaudible at 00:10:29).
CLIENT: I guess it... You know, occupied with it or preoccupied with it or you’re thinking about it constantly. I don’t really know. I have a very weird... (PAUSE) ...understanding of thinking itself. (LAUGHTER) I don’t really understand (inaudible at 00:10:51). (LAUGHTER) Yeah. Feeling ","P1-N4003F1":"ambivalent or confused about the process of thinking itself. [00:11:01]
THERAPIST: Why you didn’t bring it up in here.
CLIENT: Oh no. What was your second question?
THERAPIST: I’m not sure.
CLIENT: Hmm... (PAUSE) [00:12:00]
THERAPIST: Well, it seems like something you’re trying to make a decision about that’s not clear to you is something that certainly people bring up in therapy.
CLIENT: Yeah. But it’s... It wasn’t as big of a deal. I feel like I was dealing with bigger things. It just... I just was like a low priority for me. (PAUSE) I mean, I was like, “Really? Is this really happening? No one’s ever bought...” Chris (ph) has bought tickets for ","P1-N4004F1":"me. But that was (inaudible at 00:12:51). Has he? No, no. That... (PAUSE) [00:12:57]
THERAPIST: Too much... (PAUSE)
CLIENT: Just too much. Yeah, I mean, too much (inaudible at 00:13:35). Unusual. Unprecedented. I don’t know. (PAUSE) You’re saying that normal people... (LAUGHTER) Not normal people but... I could have talked to you about this and prepared myself. [00:13:59]
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. (PAUSE)
CLIENT: (SIGH) Well...
THERAPIST: Not only that but it’s almost mysterious...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: How little you said is striking too. Usually, people go away for a week, they just say, “Oh, I’m going here.” They say something even if they’re not talking to me about the decision. They tell me where they’re going. So there was like something mysterious... ","P1-N4005F1":"“I’ll be out of the country.”
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So little was said.
CLIENT: Well, so if I had bought the ticket, I was planning the trip, I would have had much more agency and active, I would have actively participated and actively thought about it. But I felt so passive in this scenario. You know, the ticket was bought for me already. All I had to do was print it out, ","P1-N400651":"pack a bag, take my passport and go to the airport. You know? (LAUGHTER) I mean, that is like surreal to me. That’s not happened. And I didn’t really believe that it was, this was real, you know, this was for real. [00:15:05]
THERAPIST: Well, but you canceled the sessions. You must have arranged some parts of your schedule to go.
CLIENT: I did. Yeah. I canceled a tea with my professor that I’ve been trying to arrange for the last three months. That I was really upset about. (LAUGHTER) But... (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: So it’s not like you didn’t prepare at all.
CLIENT: Yeah. But I feel like, you know, anticipation would have made it a lot worse. (PAUSE) I mean, I prepared by canceling meetings. [00:17:03]
THERAPIST: Well, but you weren’t sure if you wanted to go. Part of why he maybe sort of dropped it is because he felt you weren’t interested. He may have been responding to you. If you were presenting to him that you were eager and excited, he may not have said what he did on Friday. So ","P1-N400751":"it’s not... It wasn’t just him.
CLIENT: Yeah. It’s fine. You know, I don’t really want to invest in that way in that friendship. You know? It’s really like weird for me to go to somewhere so far away and not know practically anyone except him and his roommate. You know? I would have been staying in an apartment with ","P1-N400771":"two strange guys in a strange country. So, in a way, I’m glad it didn’t happen. You know? [00:18:05]
THERAPIST: So why say yes?
CLIENT: I feel like I didn’t really have a choice. He just kind of sent me a ticket and I was like, “Wait. I told you that I cannot afford to do this right now.” He was like, “Don’t worry about the money. Just enjoy your break.” I was like, “Okay.” And ","P1-N4007B1":"(inaudible at 00:18:25) I guess I’ll see what happens. I feel like I don’t really have agency or I don’t allow myself to take agency in certain matters. I guess I would like to work on that. No, I know I would like to. But, I mean, another thing I wanted to like say about this was ","P1-N4007B2":"it’s kind of sad that I don’t anticipate. (LAUGHTER) In the sense that I know anticipation is to me, like 90% of the pleasure of any situation. You know? [00:19:11]
THERAPIST: Well, make a decision.
CLIENT: Yeah. Even before the decision making. Like be actively thinking and be actively present. Like how hard would it have been for me to kind of like allow myself to think when he says, “Come to Qatar,” me thinking, “Okay. This is (inaudible at 00:20:15) ground level reality. Me ","P1-N400811":"in a strange apartment with strange guys in a strange country. I don’t want to do this.” [00:20:21]
THERAPIST: You know, (inaudible at 00:22:45) reminds me of the situation you were in last summer with that old guy. I mean, obviously the situations are very different. But I’m trying to figure out what the similarity is. The similarity seems to me like, “You know, this doesn’t feel ","P1-N400891":"quite right. I’m not really sure what’s going on.” You know, like... [00:23:03]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But it’s kind of the same process.
CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) Yeah. It is. (PAUSE) Yeah. I don’t know. (PAUSE) [00:24:00]
THERAPIST: And then there’s your feelings which you shouldn’t ignore either.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: The feelings you have about the situation.
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Like how do you mean in this scenario?
THERAPIST: Well, I mean, he’s annoying you. You’re not really sure what to do. But then you should feel like, “Oh, that’s how friendships are built by being sort of flexible.” But you’re having all these feelings that you’re trying to sort out and that are confusing ","P1-N4009D1":"to you and that’s one of the reasons that you’re coming to see me so I can help you with those experiences.
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah. I don’t... I was confused about that whole thing. Like some... I remember several instances where I was really annoyed. Like I was just about to start writing and he’s Skyping and I was like... I don’t know. [00:26:01]
THERAPIST: It seems like there’s your answer.
CLIENT: Yeah. What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Well, you were saying that Darren is in need but, in the end, he respects what you have to say versus just pushing.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And there’s not any sort of very clear categories. It probably exists on a continuum. But it seems like there’s one end of the continuum or the other.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It’s a little bit the way you describe your gay friend. I’m calling him your gay friend because it’s easier.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: But, you know, “Just a little bit more. Let me just... I just need a little bit more of your help.”
CLIENT: Yeah. He is... He’s getting like that. Like yesterday also, he kept pinging, “Let’s go watch this movie.” I kept saying, “No, no, no. Some other time.” (LAUGHTER) Yeah. I’m new to this where... Maybe I’m not new. But I feel like it feels new this ","P1-N400B71":"whole thing of people wanting my attention, my help, my time and me trying to figure out like how much of myself I can give to them.” [00:29:09]
THERAPIST: You are continuing?
CLIENT: Like I have the momentum still from this break in terms of like writing. And so... (PAUSE) [00:30:01]
THERAPIST: We have over ten minutes. (PAUSE)
CLIENT: I wanted to kind of bring up something else so, you know, we can talk about it and I can prepare. (LAUGHTER) So I’m looking for jobs and I don’t... I want to understand exactly why I’m looking for whatever and like what will be the, what will make most sense for me. (PAUSE) ","P1-N400C31":"This is a critical time for me. I have good momentum on my book and I want to finish and I got into that program that, you know, that people work on their novels for a whole year.
THERAPIST: Congratulations. [00:30:55]
CLIENT: Thank you. It’s very expensive actually. (LAUGHTER) But...
THERAPIST: What program is it?
CLIENT: It’s with this writing place in D.C. and they take in like ten students and we’re all working on their novels. It’s very expensive but I got their scholarship so it’s by half. But it’s still like $4,000. (LAUGHTER) So I... And I won’t get, I won’t have ","P1-N400CB1":"any money coming in over the summer because at school that’s how they do it. So I was thinking, you know, what kind of jobs I could do. And... (PAUSE) And partly, like when I was applying, I mostly applied this past week when I was supposed to be on Spring Break. I think like the motivation kind ","P1-N400CB2":"of came from a place of panic a little bit. I don’t know. Because I thought that I was going to be in Qatar and, you know, like (PAUSE) part of the reason to go was to feel kind of, you know, taken care of by a friend and, you know, I was going to ask him for a little bit of money because he had ","P1-N400CB3":"already like offered. [00:32:21]
THERAPIST: So you’re... When does the program start?
CLIENT: In May.
THERAPIST: And is that in addition to going to school?
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I wanted to drop out but people are like, “No.” And then like maybe I should have one more year. So... (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: And so you want to get a part time position while you’re doing this or a full time... What are your thoughts?
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know. I guess I have to just look at my time commitments. But if I don’t... [00:34:03]
THERAPIST: Can you do the full time job and school as well? [00:36:57]
CLIENT: (SIGH) I don’t know what school will look like. I should find out. But I think I’ll have less coursework. Yeah. I’m really just lost in school. (LAUGHTER) I’m just like kind of only half there.
THERAPIST: So you’re not sure if you want to continue?
CLIENT: Yeah. But, like I said, I don’t want to drop out because that’s bad. Right?
THERAPIST: I have no idea in your... I mean, you have a degree.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You have the same exact degree already. I have no idea if it’s bad or not. (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t think it matters and if I make it as a writer, I don’t think it’ll matter if I dropped out. (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: Why do you think you turned to me to ask if it’s bad? [00:37:55]
CLIENT: No. I’m just like confirming. (LAUGHTER) I guess just looking to you to ask if it’s considered bad. (PAUSE) Or in the professional field, look at something and say, “Oh, well you dropped out.” But I don’t think I have to put that in my resume at all. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: I mean, I guess it gets... One of the thing it gets down to is how does one make decisions about things that are thoughtful and (inaudible at 00:38:35)?
CLIENT: Yeah. How do you do that?
THERAPIST: By thinking about them.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Am I thinking about it correct? At least in this job thing.
THERAPIST: You’re trying to think about it, it sounds like.
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) [00:38:57]
THERAPIST: So it sounds like the guy in Qatar was a little bit tied up with money like maybe he’d give you some money to help with this new program.
CLIENT: Yeah. No, I was talking to him about it and I was like, “Yeah. It’s expensive.” He was like, “Oh, just give me a heads up and for that much amount of money, I need some heads up. If it’s little, then you can just ask me.” And I was like, “Wait. I don’t ","P1-N401051":"know what I’m going to ask you. But, okay, if you’re offering.” (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) No, I think that’s... I should... I shouldn’t panic. I shouldn’t feel like I need to ask people for money. I have... You know, I can pay the whole thing myself. I shouldn’t... ","P1-N401052":"I just have this in the back of my head that, “Oh, I don’t have a job and my mom’s rent is also kind of there and my situation.” [00:40:09]
THERAPIST: Well, if you quit that soon, you didn’t really give it a chance.
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: I mean, what can you know in two weeks?
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) [00:42:00]
THERAPIST: Sometimes with a job, you, it takes, you have to put a lot more effort in initially just because you’re learning the job and it may take a lot less effort and energy, you know, a few months in.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But if you take a job and you go, “I can always quit in two weeks,” I’m not sure if it’s worth it to take the job.
CLIENT: Yeah. I know, which is why I’m looking at part time options. (PAUSE) But I don’t make a convincing waitress. I make even less convincing as a waitress than I am as something I’m qualified to do. It’s like, “Really?” Anyone can do that. But apparently not because ","P1-N401191":"people look on your resume and they don’t see any waitressing experience. So... (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) [00:43:00]
THERAPIST: Well, it seems like you... Will you have as many classes next year as you do this year because you’re in class a lot this year. It would be hard to imagine you having a nine to five job when you’re in class a lot.
CLIENT: No. I’m not in class a lot even now. It’s Tuesdays, there’s class during the, you know, afternoons and then another class on Wednesday nights. So...
THERAPIST: I see. I thought you were in class more during the day.
CLIENT: No. (PAUSE) [00:43:57]
THERAPIST: We’re going to need to stop for today. Okay? But I’ll see you on Wednesday.
CLIENT: Okay. See you. (PAUSE) (SIGH) I can’t get up. (PAUSE) Thank you. Have a good day.
THERAPIST: Okay. Take care. (PAUSE)
