DESCRIPTION: Client talks about family members, trust, and the difference between niceness and kindness.
THERAPIST: Hey. Come on in.
CLIENT: Hey. Sorry. I’m running a little behind. (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: Thank you for switching.
CLIENT: No worries. I certainly understand that sometimes things come up and... Yeah. (PAUSE) I’ve been thinking a fair lately about sort of casting my mind back to when I was in therapy in Cleveland several years ago now. [00:01:56]
THERAPIST: I’m sorry. It was necessary for who to say? [00:16:09]
CLIENT: For Paul to say.
THERAPIST: Paul.
CLIENT: That it was necessary for Paul to ask his son to speak with him with... I mean, I think it’ll be great and helpful. But it just seems so very odd to me. (PAUSE) (inaudible) (PAUSE) in terms of the... He said (inaudible) sent me some... (PAUSE) Unnecessary but very kind to send me some ","P1-N400351":"beautiful stationery which he had consulted with Karl about and an old book that he had. [00:17:09]
THERAPIST: The description of what you’re telling me, the characterization of nice from your last therapist reminds me of almost sort of a performance in a sense, kind of saying something more intrinsic to your character. Niceness is kind of performative (ph). [00:19:07]
CLIENT: Yes. Yeah. I think that’s definitely the... There’s something... It’s all vocabulary. My mother would say being nice is being phony. There’s this... That can be a bit harsh I think on some cases... But I think niceness taken to a sort of extreme. There’s a lack ","P1-N4003D1":"of something genuine, that it’s not, not authentic. I was... (PAUSE) [00:20:00]
THERAPIST: Did you use the stationery to write the thank you note?
CLIENT: Of course. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: I had to ask that. It’s kind of cute.
CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) I have a stash but it seemed appropriate. (PAUSE) [00:28:59]
THERAPIST: Well, I was thinking it’s a counterpoint to thinking about. As I’ve described her and kind of a colloquial way, crazy... Normative and conventional is sort of the opposite of that. In some respects, although it depends on how you define all these terms...
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) It’s funny. I mean, of course, you would never... (PAUSE) Yeah. If somebody walked into your house and picked up a china plate off your table because you had, you know, you invited them to dinner and you set out the nice china, and they took the plate and smashed it down ","P1-N400711":"onto the table so that it shattered into fragments... [00:41:11]
THERAPIST: Tammy (ph), we’re going to need to stop for today. I was thinking what is the adult equivalent of a time out? But I will see you next Tuesday. Okay?
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay. Take care. [00:46:01]
