DESCRIPTION: Client discusses how her weight and body image has a negative impact on her self-esteem. Client thinks that everyone focuses on her weight when they see her and that they all judge her accordingly.
THERAPIST: Hi! Come on in!
CLIENT: Forgot that this was traffic time!
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I didn’t give myself extra time.
THERAPIST: I hate it when the (inaudible). (client affirms) For sure.
CLIENT: Um, so I was thinking more about how last time, we were talking about sort of how I was having these like anxiety panic attack-type things. So, something that I noticed is that (and it kind of relates to that), I’m... So then like, new interactions and new situations like, for example, ","P1-N400181":"my new job. I’m kind of reverting back to... I think I had mentioned to you that when I started high school, I decided that I was going to be like, really quiet and shy so that I wouldn’t upset anyone and just kind of like, keep to myself and couldn’t possibly do anything to make someone ","P1-N400182":"not like me. [00:07:40]
THERAPIST: Among other things, you feel so conspicuous. (client affirms) It’s like, really just feel conspicuous.
CLIENT: I just, well, because and I notice that like... There was a girl that’s, you know, much younger than me and like, she’s, you know, taking some college classes. Just like, you know, doing this job at the hospital, and she was training me and taking me on some different like, rounds ","P1-N4002C1":"to go visit the patients. I noticed my body language, that I was sort of standing like this like, sort of trying to, in my body language, I was trying to make myself like, smaller. Like, and I, I was like this, “Why am I doing this?” I was trying to stop myself from doing it, but like, in ","P1-N4002C2":"the way that I was carrying myself, I was trying to, it was like, I was trying to act like, small and not like, you know, walking around with confidence. I was, my body language was very much like, closed, smaller, like... (therapist responds) [00:16:10]
THERAPIST: Did you feel like you feel threatened by them, or...?
CLIENT: Oh, I, well, no. I don’t think that anyone would feel threatened, because I...
THERAPIST: I’m thinking like, “I don’t want them to think I’m anybody,” as opposed to “I don’t want them to think I’m somebody.”
CLIENT: Well, if that’s like, that’s the weird sort of thing. It’s like, I’m automatically thinking like, “They must think that I’m a nobody. So I’m just going to act as small as possible.” Like, it’s just (sighs), it’s sort of like... especially ","P1-N400361":"because I’m like, “Well, because I’m doing this job, they must think that I, you know, didn’t go to college or something or like...” Even though I know that people in the hospital probably know that actually, there is a lot of nutrition students like, doing this job. But ","P1-N400362":"in my mind, I’m thinking like, “They must all think like, everyone here is so far above me, they’re RNs, they’re doctors, they are nutritionists,” and I’m just like, this person. I want to act small, but also, my body is so big and they must see how big my body is, ","P1-N400363":"like look how much room I’m taking up when I walk around and look... [00:18:40]
THERAPIST: Do you feel, you know, in talking about how you acutely self-conscious you feel, do you feel that in here when you talk about it?
CLIENT: (pause) A little. Like, well (sighs), I mean I think I just kind of always feel like that. (chuckles) Unless... no, I mean... I think I just always sort of feel bigger. Like, I just, I think, I think it’s more like... I’m more hyper aware, maybe, when I’m in the hospital, because ","P1-N4003C1":"it’s like, you know, we’re dealing with patients that have a lot of health issues because of weight, or because of other things. But that’s part of it. So I feel that everybody around me, that’s medically trained, knows how bad it is to be overweight, and that when they’re ","P1-N4003C2":"looking at me, they’re automatically thinking things, because they know how bad that is. So I think it’s like, a setting where I’m more hyper aware, because I feel like those people like, know more about how bad it is. So I feel like they would notice it more, even though I mean... ","P1-N4003C3":"The only time I notice it about other people is when I’m making them better than me (ph) in some sort of a way. [00:21:18]
THERAPIST: Sounds so exhausting!
CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) But it’s sort of like, it really is like, now that I think about it, it really is going back to this, it’s almost like a defense mechanism (the acting really small or trying to be quiet). It’s like, that defense mechanism that I used when I was younger, because ","P1-N4004C1":"I just didn’t want anyone to have anything to say about me. But now, it’s like, that plus this super, hyper like, focus on weight. [00:26:50]
THERAPIST: Please don’t apologize for crying. (client crying) I want you to feel like you can cry in here.
CLIENT: I just feel like, a lot of it feels like everything bad is because of my weight (crying). If I could just have enough self-control to overcome it, then (sniffles) everything would be okay, but... (crying) But for some reason, I feel like, I feel like I like, self-sabotage myself by not doing ","P1-N400541":"enough, and like, not restricting my diet enough, and not working out enough. Like, I feel like... I feel like I’m harming myself by not doing enough of the things that I know are right, and that I know are like, what’s needed to lose weight. [00:30:36]
THERAPIST: Here is my thought about what you’re saying (client sniffles). Here is one of my thoughts. (client affirms) Things being okay was completely not in your control growing up at all, and that’s a terrifying feeling for a kid to have. (client affirms) You developed this way of thinking ","P1-N400581":"about how you can control things. Sort of a whole system that I think has very little to do with your weight (client affirms), but it’s a way that you’ve organized yourself, and made yourself feel like things are not going to spiral out of control. The problems it’s caused, the problem ","P1-N400582":"is that it’s caused sort of other problems (client affirms), sort of this hyper focus on your weight (client affirms), and feeling like somehow you’re just not good enough (client sniffles). But I think that what you were describing before (about not being okay, you just need to make things ","P1-N400583":"okay), I think this is absolutely a carryover from your childhood, and just sort of this panic that something horrible is going to happen (client affirms), that’s taking the form, you know, of your impending death (client affirms) or your future death. (client affirms) But I think it’s sort ","P1-N400584":"of a way to name something that just feels nameless. [00:33:13]
CLIENT: Yeah, and I, I mean... That’s, it’s (sighs)... It’s sort of like, but what I, I guess what, what I don’t understand is (sniffles), I feel like I have this... Sometimes I feel like I am somehow like, preventing myself from losing weight, in a psychological sort of way, ","P1-N4005A1":"because (sighs)... I feel like I’m, you know, making excuses to not go to the gym or like, being lazy and not cooking dinner. Like I (sighs), I feel like I’m... and I mean... part of me like, wanting to do all of these things is part of the control thing, but like, I feel like it’s ","P1-N4005A2":"something else, because... I almost feel like, I know what I should do, but I’m just not doing it. It’s almost sort of like, it’s something psychological that I can’t overcome in order to like, do all of these things. [00:34:51]
THERAPIST: And that could be somehow related to what I was saying. I don’t know exactly how. (client affirms) It could, I mean there could be so many reasons for it. It could be sort of an identification with your mother’s vision of yourself as a kid (client affirms), a deep identification. ","P1-N400601":"I mean, I believe that that’s true. (client affirms) There is that whole other piece to it. I mean, what you’re saying... Like, I’m sort of speaking to this panic that you feel (client affirms), but you’re saying there is also kind of a “reality piece” (inaudible) ","P1-N400602":"something (client affirms), which, you know, but I mean, sort of (inaudible) both. (client affirms) But you want to understand that piece of it, too. I appreciate that’s an important piece.
CLIENT: Yeah, because it’s almost, it’s like, well, it’s like the way my mom and the way I thought other people saw me, but it’s also... It’s almost like... Now, it’s like, this has been my struggle for the past few years. Like this is... I’m like, like in my ","P1-N400621":"mind, I’m like, waddling around as a fat person. Like, that’s... part of it is like, become that identify that like, I’ve made for myself, too, now. [00:37:44]
THERAPIST: Like you could die? Prematurely?
CLIENT: Yeah like, I could die or you know, I could... No one will hire me as a dietician because I’m so fat. Like, I’m, even all the areas that I’m like, feeling really good about, I’m like sabotaging everything because of the weight. Like, I’m letting it effect every ","P1-N4006E1":"single area of my life and I’m basically (even though I’ve had all these great successes), I’m making my weight be like, my biggest failure.
THERAPIST: Maybe on some level, you feel that if everything is okay and good, that you won’t have any connection with your mother. [00:42:34]
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. Yeah, I mean it could be. Like (sighs), because I feel like, with my family, it was always like, there is always something wrong. So, like (sighs)... the other... I don’t talk to my mom this frequently (chuckles) anymore, but the other day, she had called me. (sniffles) I ","P1-N400721":"hadn’t talked to her in a while, so I called her back. I was like, you know, “Work was really great today and then I also got nominated for this position in a practice group and like, things are going really well, and I...” She was kind of busy, and kind of like, “Oh, that’s ","P1-N400722":"great.” Like, “That’s great...,” but kind of like... dismi , like it was kind of like, when you have these really good things, she’s like, “Oh...,” but if I said, “I’m so depressed,” or like said something like that, then she would have time ","P1-N400723":"for it. [00:43:37]
THERAPIST: Dangerous. (ph)
CLIENT: But, yeah. Like, that’s the way that you make connections, but you don’t make connections over good things. You make connections over bad things. And, so I think that’s kind of part of it, too, is like, that’s just how I learned to interact with other people.
THERAPIST: Well, Felicity (sp), we’re going to need to stop in a little bit (ph). Like, try to do things differently. (client affirms) Okay. So I will see, then, next week.
CLIENT: Yeah, and I need to give you, I think my credit card is expiring, the one that I had given you. And so they sent me a new one, with a new card number. (therapist affirms) So I just wanted to give it to you (therapist affirms), to give to Kelly (sp). Is that okay?
THERAPIST: Sure, that’s fine.
CLIENT: I didn’t want to write it over e-mail to her, because I thought that was probably bad.
THERAPIST: Yeah, that’s fine. That’s fine. I also have to, I’m going to look. Your insurance company is paying more than I thought they would, so I’m going (client responds) to adjust your co-pay. I’ll have to, I didn’t look at it that... You...
CLIENT: So you think it’s because, though, was that the one from the consult? Or no, they actually (therapist denies) are paying more? Okay.
THERAPIST: No, it’s not. It’s just that, the insurance pays... They just pay such a varied amount that I, I make a guess (client affirms), sort of, because it takes, sometimes it takes (inaudible), (client chuckles) and it’s usually, but so, I’ve seen a couple of policies reimburse ","P1-N400861":"what your policy reimburses (client affirms), but that’s not standard.
CLIENT: Oh, okay.
THERAPIST: But I’ve seen it. So anyway, so I took a guess, but it’s a little bit more than I thought, so I’m going to go back and look at it. So you may not even be charged this month (client affirms), I’ll let you know, if you would like, just kind of carry it over or something. ","P1-N4008A1":"Okay, so I’ll see you next week! (inaudible) (blocked). Okay, great! Take care, bye bye.
