DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her confusion about her current path in life and how she should proceed. Client has not had much success and is jealous of those around her who have.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in!
CLIENT: I was thinking about the last conversation that we had. I guess I don't really understand what it means to feel sad. (chuckles) (inaudible) I think it's can be dangerous to not know the distinction, because, you know, when you asked me like, you've allowed yourself to feel sad, I'm sad so ","P1-N400131":"often, I feel (chuckles) that I just said yes and then you were like, that is, you know, that's not sadness; it's guilt or... couple of other negative emotions, bringing myself down, et cetera. (therapist affirms) So, I guess I should know what exactly you mean by feeling sad. [00:02:25]
THERAPIST: Well what comes to your mind about it?
CLIENT: Well... I mean, I guess that it's a slippery slope for me, so I just kind of slip into feeling bad about myself. Yeah. Feeling (ph) myself and then conveying I'm not going to amount to much, or I can't do whatever, because... you know... (pause) Or you know, like, the lack, you know, that I ","P1-N400171":"would have, you know? I'm always thinking really small, in every single thing. (chuckles) The feeling bad and sad and so (therapist responds)... [00:03:19]
THERAPIST: (pause) Feeling sad that you had to suffer the things that you've suffered in life... which is not the same thing as pity.
CLIENT: Oh, yeah. (pause) Yeah. It's very hard for me to understand this. Is that surprising? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: Why not? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Is it surprising that it's hard for you to understand? (client affirms) No! Why would it be surprising? [00:10:52]
CLIENT: It seems like you're saying something very simple! But I just like, I'm completely (chuckles) baffled by this, by the emotion, because I feel like I'm so emotional. I feel like I'm very experienced with all kinds of emotions! (chuckles) But maybe, maybe it's not about experiencing the emotion, ","P1-N400311":"but understanding it. Like, it's a cognitive like, instead of... emotional, maturity or immaturity. (pause) Yeah, because like, I feel suddenly fused with my mom when we talk about sadness, and then it's like... you know, that is another, you know, can of worms that has also exploded here (chuckles), ","P1-N400312":"that has exploded here. [00:11:55]
THERAPIST: How do you feel fused, when you think about sadness?
CLIENT: Well, you know like, she and I were together in that mess, right? So, when I feel sad, I feel fused with her, and you know like, destiny, fate, and lot. You know, so it's like, she and I have the same lot, we are in the same lot.
THERAPIST: But not at all! She was an adult (client affirms), who was living her life as a woman, a married woman and a mother. You were a kid! That's not remotely the same.
CLIENT: (pause) Hmm. (pause) Well, she does say that she had a better childhood than me, sometimes. (chuckles) [00:12:47]
THERAPIST: Really? That's interesting. (pause) How do you feel when she says that?
CLIENT: I like it. (chuckles) And I feel a little jealous, but I like it. Like, "I want to know that; tell me," you know? I want to... be... her sibling! (chuckles) So I can have her dad. Because the little I've heard of, you know, he was a good, kind man, so (therapist responds)...
THERAPIST: What are you, where... what are your thoughts about that?
CLIENT: I don't know.
THERAPIST: If that's... Something brought that to mind.
CLIENT: Oh. Yeah, so I mean that... like, you know, the whole thing here is that I should know myself. What does that mean, you know like, taking care of yourself and being whole, feeling whole? So what does that look like, you know? I'm thinking of people who I think seem whole, able to take care of ","P1-N400491":"things that open (ph)... the moment when they feel, they come across as whole people, or people who, is when they say "no" to things like, "Oh, do you want to go do this?" And I'm like, "No, I should go home and take a nap." (chuckles) I get like that sometimes like... I feel distinct (inaudible) sometimes. [00:16:00]
THERAPIST: Oh. Where is that question coming from?
CLIENT: (pause) I'm lost, so like, claim the power or center or anything, you know?
THERAPIST: You don't think you need a core? (client affirms) Well, what do you think the core would help you do?
CLIENT: I don't know. What does it look like? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: It was your concept!
CLIENT: Well, I suddenly thought of... the couple of years... Four? (inaudible)... Whatever... But like, when Chris, my mom and I were laying together... I don't know, just (inaudible) certain Sunday evenings, how boring they are to me. Chris (inaudible). (chuckles) I just like, stick with negative ","P1-N400711":"impressions, and then it colors like, the whole picture of the certain phase (ph) of life. Then I'm just like, "That was bad!" Like, everything about it was just bad, just because of, you know, one negative impression. [00:25:05]
THERAPIST: You ask me a lot of questions that you have thoughts about.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) The answer is no, because like, I mean, it's sad, that's what I mean, but you come back to what we started with like, sad. Like, there are so many artists, American artists, who experience such horrible childhoods, and then turn out famous. So I would expect they'd say that their ","P1-N4007B1":"core, also, was books, you know. If it weren't for books, they would... they would be dead, I don't know.
THERAPIST: With a core, you would have thought he was just crazy. (repeats)
CLIENT: I mean, I do think now that he was crazy. (pause) I'm mean, now that I have experienced that, I know obviously the next time someone says, "Oh, poor you," I'd be like, "You know, this is all (inaudible)." (chuckles) You know. So... (pause) Yeah, so I think... (sighs) I understand what it means ","P1-N4008F1":"to feel sad, whatever it is. (pause) It feels like it will get in the way of me feeling... that anything is possible and like, living (inaudible).
THERAPIST: What part are you...?
CLIENT: Sort of like, feeling sad can be a hindrance to doing things.
THERAPIST: It depends on how you mean it.
CLIENT: (pause) What do you mean? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well, how do you imagine it being a hindrance?
CLIENT: (pause) Well, like I described earlier like, I see other people, you know, doing X, Y, Z, and I feel like I would be like... normal and not going to do those things, because I'm too shy or I am afraid of rejection or, you know, or maybe, you know, logistically, I can't do it with them. "Oh, ","P1-N4009F1":"I have to make money, because who will pay your mom's rent, you know?" [00:38:22]
THERAPIST: How is that feeling sad? I'm not sure what makes that sad.
CLIENT: Well, I thought being sad meant knowing your limitations.
THERAPIST: (pause) I guess I don't understand. Sad is a feeling. (client affirms) (pause) How is a feeling related to limitations?
CLIENT: I don't know. It feels linked. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: (pause) Are you associating feeling sad with feeling discouraged? (client affirms) I see. You think I'm encouraging you to feel discouraged?
CLIENT: No. (chuckles) I'm asking you what it means to be sad. I don't understand it like...
THERAPIST: (affirms) "I'm sad that these things happen to me." [00:39:28]
CLIENT: (pause) And then what to do you do, after that?
THERAPIST: You live your life. (pause) I think you are sad, but I think you do a lot of things that push that sadness away, or turn it into something else that I do think impedes you. (client affirms) I think you take the sadness, you sometimes turn it into feeling sorry for yourself, and maybe angry ","P1-N400B11":"or victimized. So it's not that you don't feel sad, but it's what you do with the sadness that I don't think serves you in the end.
CLIENT: Well, that's good. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?
CLIENT: Hmm... It makes me sad and hopeful. (chuckles) (pause) I feel like this lets me like, sad as (inaudible).
THERAPIST: Sometimes there are just a lot of other things mixed up with it. (client chuckles and agrees) Jealousy, anger... the name, too. (ph)
CLIENT: I guess I'm wondering what, how would it be like, to feel whole if I feel sad (inaudible)? That's the part... I'm going to... (pause) It's really not about your limitations?
THERAPIST: I don't, I don't know. I mean, I don't actually understand how the two are connected, but they could be connected in your mind. (pause) I mean, we all have limitations, but I'm not sure how the sadness is connected to that. (client responds)
CLIENT: Sure, yeah. [00:45:07]
THERAPIST: Let me take a look, let me just take a look at my schedule. (pause) So, what days would work better for you? Do you have... Like, I have 10:00 on Tuesday, but for some reason... Is Tuesday a day that would work?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Okay. I have time Thursday afternoon, or Friday.
CLIENT: Yeah, either of those days would work.
THERAPIST: Do you want to do... I have a 2:10 on Thursday the 7th. Would that work?
CLIENT: On the Friday?
THERAPIST: On Friday, I have 9:10.
CLIENT: I can do 9:10.
THERAPIST: Okay, great. (client affirms) So, I'll see you next... I'll see you next Wednesday then. (client affirms) Okay! Very good. Take care, Cecelia.
CLIENT: You, too. Have a good weekend!
THERAPIST: Thank you.
