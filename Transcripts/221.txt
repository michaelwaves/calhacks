DESCRIPTION: Client discusses trying to keep calm as she is very stressed about finishing her work, education, and finding a job to pay the rent. Client discusses feeling both burdened and stuck in her life.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in. Have a seat.
CLIENT: I’m trying to be calm I guess.
THERAPIST: Trying?
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:04:29)?
CLIENT: Well yes, it’s (inaudible at 00:04:35) out of control, so I just want things to (inaudible at 00:04:43). I don’t know. (pause)
THERAPIST: Do you not feel like I can help you feel calm? [00:06:09]
CLIENT: Oh no, I’m just kind of blank. [Laughing] And I’m trying to think of what to say. [Laughing] I don’t know what to bring up. (pause) I guess I had like a therapy session with my friend last night so [Laughing].
THERAPIST: I’m not sure what you mean.
CLIENT: Oh no, I just talked things with him. So I felt quite relieved afterwards. [Laughing] [00:07:01]
THERAPIST: Talking to your friend felt like talking to me?
CLIENT: No, it was just it’s different because like we were laughing and then we were I was really like down I was a bit down yesterday and I just wanted to get home from class and work and be productive and stuff. But I didn’t do any work and there was (inaudible at 00:07:39) after ","P1-N400251":"school, so I learned that.
THERAPIST: People having babies is on your mind and no one having one too.
CLIENT: [Laughing], yes you are.
THERAPIST: Do you wonder about that?
CLIENT: A bit. I mean I’m always very like I used to be very good with kids and like yes, I’m very motherly. [Laughing] But I just don’t have the choice to have one. I don’t know if I’ll ever have one. [00:12:00]
THERAPIST: Why do you say that?
CLIENT: Oh, I don’t know. [Laughing] Because I can’t even seem to like to get married so [Laughing].
THERAPIST: But I wonder if you wonder what my life is or what I think about a baby or…
CLIENT: [Laughing], no. No, I was like comparing myself to friends who have babies. I know it’s very hard work. So I’m not like oh baby, nice to hold or whatever. I know it’s not like that. (pause)
THERAPIST: I don’t know. Do you feel very focused?
CLIENT: What does that look like? [Laughing] Like (inaudible at 00:18:49)?
THERAPIST: I don’t know. I’m not sure what you mean.
CLIENT: I’m not feeling very focused. I might be somewhat determined and obsessed, but that’s not the same as focused.
THERAPIST: What did you have in mind when you said distractions?
CLIENT: No, I just wondered like I was imagining talking, saying all this to my mom. I don’t know what she would say. A slightly different version of my mom where you would say, no need to distract yourself. All these are distractions; boys. [Laughing]
THERAPIST: So you were wondering if would respond the way your mother would?
CLIENT: Yes. [Laughing]
THERAPIST: Why would I respond in a similar way?
CLIENT: No, I was just imagining talking to like an elder and like you know, seeking wisdom. [00:20:15]
THERAPIST: So a wiser person would say that you are seeking distractions?
CLIENT: [Laughing] I was just wondering, am I. (pause)
THERAPIST: You seem kind of disengaged today. [00:23:08]
CLIENT: [Laughing] Yes, I don’t really know what realms to bring up or, you know. (pause)
THERAPIST: Your goals; your aspirations?
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Those are things to engage with. I’m trying to do X, so I’m going to engage with how I get there.
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: It’s like I want to X, so how do I get there?
CLIENT: Yes. But I’m the one doing it. [Laughing]
THERAPIST: Yes. And I think that you’re feeling that more generally. Should I get a job; should I not get a job? Should I deal with (inaudible at 00:24:47)? You’re not really sure how to even think about what you want and then, you know, getting it’s a little bit too specific, but ","P1-N4008D1":"having a plan to get there. [00:25:01]
CLIENT: Yes, I guess.
THERAPIST: Because you’ve certainly come in here at times and been like I want to talk about this. I’ve been thinking about it and I really want to talk about it. And you haven’t been like that lately. You’ve seemed kind of distracted and kind of keeping to yourself.
CLIENT: Yes (pause). Well I guess I was worried about stuff money and something. I don’t know. (pause)
THERAPIST: I don’t know. I don’t know how long it’s been, but definitely there’s some period of time.
CLIENT: Yes. So like over the break; the winter break I had a plan. (pause) I wanted to like go through the entire draft and put a draft together. And I kind of lost a few days here and there because of helping my friend and stuff. But I still kind of I had a plan and I stuck to it and I think I wrote ","P1-N400A31":"pretty much every day for like several hours.
THERAPIST: Sounds like a good way.
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: It sounds like a good way.
CLIENT: Yes. Are there like shortcuts like I don’t know, sex or something? [Laughing]
THERAPIST: I’m not following.
CLIENT: Well I don’t know. Like you feel it’s a way of feeling invigorated or something, like you get out of a funk, probably.
THERAPIST: I see. Are you feeling like you’re in a funk?
CLIENT: No, not a funk, but more like disengaged and like what do I grasp. What do I hold on to and not get swayed by other things. [00:31:11] (pause)
THERAPIST: So what’s painful about it?
CLIENT: Well it’s just like the teacher is kind of old and she just kind of goes on [Laughing] and just like it’s a poetry class so like she can spend like an hour talking about one poem. And it’s just like you know, it’s just so plain, you know. It’s just not challenging ","P1-N400BF1":"enough for me at all. [Laughing] [00:32:16]
THERAPIST: It’s really hard for you to make decisions.
CLIENT: Is it?
THERAPIST: It seems like it.
CLIENT: Why? [Laughing]
THERAPIST: Why is it hard?
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: You want me to tell you it’s hard for you to make decisions because…
CLIENT: Yes. [Laughing]
THERAPIST: So I think this is one of the things that really stands in your way that sometimes when you’re feeling overwhelmed or distracted you become very passive and you sort of like oh, tell me why I do this. Tell me why I do this.
CLIENT: Yes. How do I change that behavior? [00:34:05]
THERAPIST: Well certainly by observing it first. But I’ve seen you do this before, now that I think about it. It’s sort of like you sort of wait on the periphery of your life and hope something changes, like rather than taking charge and making decisions which is too bad because you know, ","P1-N400DD1":"you have a lot of good options and opportunities.
CLIENT: [Laughing] Yes, I know. I’m looking for jobs. I mean that’s active, right. That’s taking control. And how something means panicking I’m going I don’t know, I don’t know. Someone tell me what to do. I guess that’s my nature. [00:35:15]
THERAPIST: Let’s talk about that because I do I think that you’re on to something. I think that that’s what part of what’s holding you back that you start to panic. What are you panicking about?
CLIENT: Why I make the wrong decisions. [Laughing] (pause) There are so many options I feel like I need someone to guide me. But then I guess I can, when I think about it, after you pointed it out, I can, you know, step back and make a plan and think things through.
THERAPIST: That’s a very good question. What is the worst that can happen?
CLIENT: I come home tired and stressed out every day most of the time. And I don’t want to work with my mom. And I feel stuck and trapped. I guess that’s the worst. I cannot quit.
THERAPIST: Are you thinking about getting a summer job so you’d have enough money to start the program in the fall? Is that how I don’t, you know, what is your thinking? [00:38:04]
CLIENT: I don’t know. So I applied to a bunch of jobs and only this one got back, so like a full-time job; permanent job.
THERAPIST: And when does the program start?
CLIENT: In May.
THERAPIST: And is that like something that you go to classes for or what like what are your obligations?
CLIENT: Yes, it’s like a Monday night thing I think.
THERAPIST: I see. So it’s not a daytime thing?
CLIENT: And then school starts in September, but I don’t get paid from like I don’t get paid in June, July, and August. (pause) And the next step is to ask my teachers if they know of some jobs. (pause)
THERAPIST: I know paying your rent is a big deal and you have mentioned that you didn’t do it this month.
CLIENT: Yes so, but she’s like she’s paying from her savings and stuff and I feel bad about that. I don’t know what’s going on with her situation. I was like we all thought that this like internship was going to be paid but it’s not. [Laughing]
THERAPIST: Did they tell her she was going to get paid and then didn’t pay her or what happened?
CLIENT: No, we didn’t know. I don’t know why we assumed she was going to get paid, but it seemed like a job, you know, so that’s why.
THERAPIST: I don’t think student teaching usually get paid.
CLIENT: Okay. [00:40:00]
THERAPIST: But she didn’t know to ask?
CLIENT: Yes. But it’s a long assignment, right. It’s like a whole semester. It’s not like, you know, two days or two days a week even, you know.
THERAPIST: I know when I was in grad school my internship for years was unpaid.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: I worked like 25 hours a week or something and was not paid. So it does when you’re in training the pay is considered the education you get from the training. It’s not true in all fields, but it’s not unusual.
CLIENT: Okay, yes.
THERAPIST: And student teaching, I don’t think student teachers typically get paid. But I guess it sounds like she wasn’t you know she didn’t know to ask.
CLIENT: Yes, I mean that’s okay. Maybe in May she’ll get a job. [Laughing]
THERAPIST: How did you decide not to pay it this month; her rent?
CLIENT: I just same way I decided to go to the (inaudible at 00:40:59). It wasn’t really a decision. It was like that [Laughing] ignored it. Oops, slipped my mind kind of, that’s what I think.
THERAPIST: I think you feel so much better about your life the more you can take ownership of your decisions. It sounds like you decided not to pay it, but you didn’t want to take ownership for it.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Well it’s in your power to have that control, but I think it scares you to take that control. Say this is what I’m deciding to do.
CLIENT: Yes. That’s why I cannot decide so many things, you know. Like follow around like I don’t want to decide because I’ll be a no this is something I know I’ll get bored with them, you know. [00:42:27]
THERAPIST: Well if it’s true that you will feel bored with either of them and you don’t want to be with a man that you feel bored with, you can go find somebody else. [00:43:04]
CLIENT: [Laughing] Keep looking.
THERAPIST: People do that.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: If that’s how you feel, that’s what you feel is going on. I almost wonder like there are so many sort of decisions or maybe even not decisions but events, in your at least in your mother’s life and maybe in your father’s life that were like catastrophic, that maybe ","P1-N4013F1":"it’s hard for you to imagine that, you know, maybe make a decision and maybe think, well this maybe not have been the best decision, but so what.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Maybe that’s what scares you so much. Because it begs the question of what’s a wrong decision. I mean sometimes you make a decision and it doesn’t turn out the way you want. Is that wrong; I don’t wrong to me implies that you’re making it for the wrong reasons. [00:44:02]
CLIENT: Well like for my mom is was, right. She married the wrong man and that was catastrophic.
THERAPIST: But that’s what I mean, that that has been your model, that decisions have been catastrophic for your mother certainly. And that then your assumption is that they will be catastrophic for you.
CLIENT: Yes. (pause)
THERAPIST: But that was exactly my point, that your experience; certainly your family and your family’s experience has been very much passed on to you as that, you know, events major sort of life decisions and events can be completely catastrophic and change the course of your life in a really, ","P1-N401511":"really negative, horrible way. [00:45:08]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: But there’s none of the decisions that we’ve talked about are irreversible or catastrophic.
CLIENT: Yes. [Laughing]
THERAPIST: It doesn’t feel that way?
CLIENT: Yes, I don’t know. [Laughing]
THERAPIST: Well maybe that’s something you need to think about more. You know Cecelia (sp) we do need to stop for today.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So I will see you on Monday.
CLIENT: All right.
THERAPIST: Okay, thanks.
CLIENT: Oh, if I go to Ohio I don’t know if I’ll be able to make it on Monday. But can I e-mail you like later today about that?
THERAPIST: Why don’t you e-mail me later today, because I’m happy to find a time another time next week to meet if you don’t think that Monday will work.
CLIENT: Okay, next Monday like early in the morning. But I’ll (inaudible at 00:45:52).
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: I’ll do it today.
THERAPIST: Let me know. I don’t have I don’t think I have anything later on Monday, so let me know so I can always find you a different day of the week.
CLIENT: Okay. [00:46:00]
THERAPIST: Okay. Okay, take care.
CLIENT: Bye.
THERAPIST: Bye-bye.
