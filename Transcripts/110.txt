DESCRIPTION: Client discusses his perception of how negative his family is, especially his parents. He is also concerned about his fiance's inability to stop drinking before she blacks out.
CLIENT: Sorry I’m late.
THERAPIST: It’s okay.
CLIENT: How are you doing?
THERAPIST: Good, thank you.
CLIENT: Good. Well. A lot of things have happened. How can I say this? I kind of had a conversation with my mother and she kind of took it the wrong way because I kind of just expressed my feelings of like what I’ve been going through in my treatment and just how I feel about certain situations. ","P1-N400141":"And it was to the point where, you know, my mother got even more depressed, you know. Basically thought that I called her a bad mother. And pretty much, you know, took it that I was really angry at her.
THERAPIST: You know, I have two thoughts about what you often sort of do in here, what we talk about. One is sort of just telling me what’s going on in your life and how you’re feeling about it. Sometimes I feel like you’re trying to convince me, like make a case, like as if I’m ","P1-N400601":"not…believe you or can’t really describe it, but there’s sort of a way you communicate. It’s like that you’re trying to convince me of something.
CLIENT: Like of what?
THERAPIST: I don’t know. It’s like you’re presenting a justification for how you’re feeling. Because if I wouldn’t feel that you were justified.
CLIENT: Okay, I didn’t see it like that.
THERAPIST: Really? That’s sometimes how I feel. Like, you know.
CLIENT: Okay, well that’s good to know because that’s part of my communication. Well, speaking then, an incident happened this weekend where me and my fiancé, she went out on Friday night and got drunk. And as I told you before, I used to have a lot of anger issues with her getting ","P1-N4006C1":"drunk. Well, I feel like she tells me when I bring it up to her and tell her how concerned I am, how, you know, I think she needs to work on it and do this stuff. We had an argument, you know, last night that she thinks that I’m like attacking her; just like the way I talk to her. And I was confused, ","P1-N4006C2":"just like now. Like my tone of voice or whatever I use, a word choice I use; I don’t know. Because it was sincere. It was genuine. I care about her. I was genuinely very worried about her safety. And every time I feel like I bring it up, it gets me in hot water.
THERAPIST: Did you feel like that’s what she was saying; that it’s your fault?
CLIENT: Well I have a feeling that she was telling me like here I go; here you go again constantly yelling at me, constantly putting me down. You know. I mean she thinks I don’t see the positives in her. I see all the positives in her.
THERAPIST: Do you know what she’s talking about when she says that? I mean does it just seem like she is misinterpreting everything? Do you know what she’s referring to?
CLIENT: I know what she’s talking about because every time she used to get blacked out drunk, I told you I used to get very enraged and we used to get in vicious fights where I would abuse her mentally all the time and tell her she needs to cut the shit. She needs to see somebody and that she’s ","P1-N4008A1":"an alcoholic and until she comes to the realization that she’s an alcoholic, she’ll always be an alcoholic.
THERAPIST: What scares you about them getting drunk?
CLIENT: Because she gets so drunk where her eyes are like this.
THERAPIST: Are you afraid she’s going to get drunk too?
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: Are you afraid her friends are going to get drunk or she’s going to get drunk?
CLIENT: Oh, I know her friends are going to get drunk. I don’t care about them. I care about her. But when she gets drunk, she gets so drunk where she just…her eyes are wide open, her pupils are so dilated that she looks possessed. She looks sick. She drinks herself that much and she’s ","P1-N4009C1":"constantly stumbling and falling over and slurs her words. And instead of stopping and going to bed, she reaches for the bottle even more. And then wakes up the next morning and tells me she hates doing that. She doesn’t want to do it. But two weeks later, we’re back at it.
THERAPIST: Well you do get impatient with people who are challenged by changing.
CLIENT: I do. I do because I had that problem for a while. I was very hesitant towards changing. I was very hesitant about moving forward and actually getting going with my life because I was; I was in a comfort zone where I was just content with what I was doing, where I was working, what I was making. ","P1-N400AA1":"Until I got that kick in the rear end to finally, okay, now you have to change. That’s how I’ve constantly felt. I feel like, you know, something; the only person that’s going to get you to motivate and do something is yourself. If you can’t motivate yourself, no one is going ","P1-N400AA2":"to motivate you.
THERAPIST: You don’t like things you can’t control.
CLIENT: Who me? No. I don’t. I’m the same way. I’m just like everybody else.
THERAPIST: Well you’re very frustrated that you can’t make your girlfriend do things, even if it’s in her best interest. You get very frustrated.
CLIENT: I’m frustrated but I don’t express it anymore. I just hold all this inside because I am saddened by it because when someone goes to work and they’re coming home crying because of their job, that’s not a good job for you. If you’re crying and frustrated and upset ","P1-N400B61":"over work because people get making personal attacks on you, even though it’s at your company and you take them as personal attacks, you know, you need to make a decision.
THERAPIST: Well whether you express it or not, you still feel frustrated and that’s something that we need to work on because it doesn’t seem like it serves you.
CLIENT: No. No I guess you’re right. I am frustrated because I just feel like well; here’s where my frustration is. The whole time I was going through my issues at the same company we worked at, she kept telling me to leave, and leave, and leave. And I wouldn’t do it. Until one day ","P1-N400C01":"when I got called in, they were going to do this and I finally said alright, “F” this. I’m leaving.
THERAPIST: I’m sorry…I need to…we’re also going to need to stop in a moment and I wanted to ask about scheduling. But yeah, I mean the bottom line is these all sound really reasonable things, but they may not happen. And so the question is…
CLIENT: I know.
THERAPIST: But then the question is…but I’m not saying that. It’s sort of a reality check. I’m saying that in terms of like I want to help you deal with the feelings that you have because they’ve got to go somewhere. And so it’s hard to know what to do with them. ","P1-N400CA1":"So I do want to help you with that.
CLIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. I just forgot about it because I forgot that I had Back to School Night. And I just remembered when I went on e-mail. So that was my fault.
THERAPIST: Well I want…I always want things to feel fair. I mean my schedule fills up pretty quickly so if I hold that time for you, I can’t do it anything.
CLIENT: No, I know.
THERAPIST: So, but I…and this is not to sort of you know scold you or anything, I just want to make sure that we’re on the same page and everything is fair.
CLIENT: Nope, yep, we are. We are. It’s just like I said, I signed those forms a long time ago and I…
THERAPIST: I understand.
CLIENT: It just…I forgot about it. That was totally on me and I apologize.
THERAPIST: No, not at all. I just…I know how much since you’ve suffered unfairness and so I certainly wouldn’t want that to come in to our relationship.
CLIENT: No. And I appreciate that. Thank you.
THERAPIST: We are going to need to stop.
CLIENT: Okay. Alrighty.
THERAPIST: So I will see you next week.
CLIENT: Alright, thank you. Good to see you.
THERAPIST: Okay, good luck with everything. Good to see you too.
