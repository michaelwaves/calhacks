DESCRIPTION: Client seeks validation from ex-boyfriend's approval of her and is heartbroken after he tells her they can never get back together. Client discusses other dating adventures and her desire for success at her chosen profession.
CLIENT: I have no idea. When was the last time I was here? Was it Tuesday or Wednesday?
THERAPIST: Wednesday morning.
CLIENT: A lot has happened since then, I guess. (chuckles) Had I signed the lease for my mom's apartment?
THERAPIST: I don't think you had. No.
CLIENT: Well, I'll get to that book. [00:00:57]
THERAPIST: If you were together, what would you imagine it would bring for you?
CLIENT: I don't know. I haven't really imagined that, too much, to be honest. I have reservations, too, about him. Before I took this plunge into this madness, when I was thinking rationally, and even before, when we were just friends, I could see things that I didn't like about him. I mean, they're ","P1-N400251":"a lot hazy now. He's not as ambitious. He doesn't have that spark of wanting to do something different, wanting to make a difference, like I think I have and Chris (sp?) definitely has.
THERAPIST: How did it feel dramatic?
CLIENT: I'm thinking of it in terms of a writer. So you're trying to write about an afternoon and it's beautiful-or you know, if you're painting a picture. There's the tree. There's the light. There's the shade. There's that drama with the light and shade going on that's all well and good. There's children. ","P1-N4002F1":"There's a swan. There's-the scene is there, but you don't have an object that really tells you-that really sums up the moment. What is it about? Is it about an afternoon where you feel love for the first time? There's no emotional investment in the scene for me, until I spotted him (chuckles) and then ","P1-N4002F2":"I knew what I needed to take the picture of. I just had to focus and zoom in on him a little bit and frame-He has long hair and he was standing underneath this weeping willow, which also has kind of flowing long hair like leaves. That just completely changed the scene for me. It's like Anna Karenina ","P1-N4002F3":"(sp?). What is she all about? She's on the train, but you know the moment that she's feeling love when Tolstoy says, "The book is open," but Anna's not reading, she's looking out the window. So, I guess that's the kind of drama, I guess, that he brings out in my perspective in my heart. [00:16:48]
THERAPIST: It sounds like a wish for some kind of transformation.
CLIENT: Hmm...from what to what?
THERAPIST: I don't know. That's a good question.
CLIENT: Well, I've always loved to take photos of Chris (sp?). I mean, I can actually get up close, as well; instead of, in Victor's case, feeling far and stealthily taking the photo. Then, the love that he has for me that comes out in his eyes. I find that beautiful, too. I've taken countless such ","P1-N400371":"photos where he's looking like that. It's beautiful. The moment is beautiful, but then it's not-it's just-there's a plainness to it and up until now I would-not up until now. He's very simple and simplicity. It's really hard to be simple. It (inaudible phrase at 00:18:03). Or you can be happy, but you ","P1-N400372":"can't be simple. Trubility (ph) is even harder than happiness. But then there is this other side to that simplicity, which is plainness and boring. He calls this, my behavior, the seven year itch and maybe that's what it is. But I think I've had this itch for much longer.
THERAPIST: Is it winning the love, or having the love that you want?
CLIENT: It's, you mean-like a game?
THERAPIST: I hadn't thought of it in terms of a game, but...
CLIENT: Yeah, maybe. I'm not saying that's not possible, that it's just the fact that he's rejected me is what has got me so upset and it's just-as soon as he says, "I love you and want to be with you forever," I'll be like, "Okay. Good-bye." (chuckles) I mean, that might be possible. I'm not ruling ","P1-N400411":"that out. Is that-that's what you meant?
THERAPIST: I had a much more open-ended idea, but what did you, when you said, "Oh, like a game," what did you have in mind?
CLIENT: Exactly this. That he's playing hard to get and I'm just like, "Okay, this has never happened to me." Every guy that I've expressed an interest in, has expressed interest back in me. (Not every guy, but you know...)
THERAPIST: What makes it dark?
CLIENT: What is this behavior? This is so ridiculous. This is, first of all, not me. I already know way better. I think. And the only positive thing that came out of it was the fact that I met Jeff (sp?). I met this guy with the disability. He reminded me of a cousin I used to have who also had lots ","P1-N400531":"of disabilities. He didn't live very long, but he was the only cousin\/brother who didn't molest me, you know? (chuckles) Everyone else was kind of-they'd done something or another at some point. Not everyone, but at least three of them. [00:27:37]
THERAPIST: When you were a kid?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What would they do?
CLIENT: Well, one guy was, you know like, he used to bite my vagina. I was like five or six. This happened repeatedly and it took a lot of courage to tell my mom.
THERAPIST: Who was he?
CLIENT: I don't know. I think he was a very distant relative, like my mom's sister's in-laws and their son they had. But, we used to visit their house a lot and in the afternoons they would be like, "Yeah, she'll be in-this guy-and going to take a nap together." I don't know why my mom didn't find that ","P1-N4005F1":"out (ph), but-(seven second pause). Yeah, but I was just very surprised by what I did Friday. I don't want to do that again. [00:28:48]
THERAPIST: I guess one of the reasons I asked about "the dark" was because the way you presented. It's kind of silly, almost absurd. And so, "the dark" part didn't fit with that exactly.
CLIENT: Well, I mean, I'm losing sight of who I am and I'm very, very embarrassed by what I did and I'm very ashamed that-I mean, Victor would call this destroying myself. And in a way, I was trying to destroy myself. You know, lose myself in drink and be so heart-broken over Victor that the first guy ","P1-N400631":"with long hair comes along and I'm like, "Hey (chuckles), you. Come here!" You know, that's not me. I'm really...if Chris (sp?) knew about this, how hurt would he be? I mean, the only way that I'm able to talk about it is to make it sound silly and absurd. [00:29:58]
THERAPIST: Because if you didn't do that and talked about it differently, then what would happen?
CLIENT: I would feel horrible about it. I want everyone to think well of me. Even someone like that guy with whom I only had one date, even his opinion matters to me that he sees me at a club and he sees me with someone else over there and gets hurt and thinks that I'm loose or whatever. Even that hurts ","P1-N400671":"me. And meeting the parents of Jeff (sp?), that disabled guy, under such a circumstance. I want them to think well of me, too, not that I was with a guy and we were kissing. I was drunk. (sigh) I don't do that and that's not me and that makes me really scared to see myself go so far away from what I ","P1-N400672":"know and what I'm comfortable with and running home at 3 a.m. in the morning and there's drunk guys about. (chuckles then 14 second pause) [00:31:18]
THERAPIST: Well, that doesn't really seem-that sounds like a devolution (sp?) not a transformation.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Transformation is something, in a sense, positive. What you're describing is feeling like you've devolved. So, the different direction.
CLIENT: It's not just you who said that. (chuckles) A lot of people have observed this. I'm really just afraid of, I guess, of getting to the bottom of things. But I know this is what I'm here for and I should feel safe -at least in this room; to be able to take myself seriously. I've never been able ","P1-N400731":"to take myself seriously. I think it's time I did. (chuckles) (8 second pause)
THERAPIST: Sure. I guess a different way-it's a question that felt sort of genuine, but I feel like there's a lot of ways-it's not just one thing I had in mind. But I guess I feel like much of what you talk about-understand that's why it's a question, because I'm not entirely sure-is about your desire ","P1-N400771":"to be seen a certain way. Is it sort of a winning, like you need to win his approval? Win his love? It's not, "Well, what happens after?" It's about the quest for that. Longing for that. The quest. And so it seems like a lot of what you describe is around that, not like, "Okay, well, then what?" But, ","P1-N400772":"then there's a piece of "then what?" because you mention having beautiful things; and I imagine having them, not just sort of winning them, but it's complicated. A lot of what you describe is this striving to get something that you desperately need. [00:34:42]
CLIENT: Yeah, hmm. Well, I feel like I've only just been striving, if even that, for just many things in life. I'm not sure if I have them, you know? So, it's hard for me to get to that point of saying, "Okay, check. This is what I have. And I have it now and this is me." I guess the only thing I have, ","P1-N400791":"or had until now, was Chris (sp?) and his love. I had to win that. It wasn't like we met and we clicked and the next day we were together. I don't know.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean that and what it is that you're questing after?
CLIENT: To be loved and to have everyone's approval to make up for the fact that I didn't have my dad's, I guess. (8 second pause) Yeah. Even until now, I'm so immature with this whole thing, that when I'm fantasizing, I fantasize about being interviewed and hearing people praise my work. (chuckles) ","P1-N4007F1":"You know it's that like, what I want to "win"? And I don't think instead of wasting time thinking about that, I could actually think about the actual work. But I spend a lot of time just fantasizing, "when it will happen this is how I'll be," and "this is who I'll be," and "I'll be wealthier, maybe." ","P1-N4007F2":"But more importantly, I will be known. That's what I want to be. I'm so uncomfortable and tired that I'm not that. I am some web person that I do stuff on websites. I'm not very proud of that. I want to have something substantial instead of just this.
THERAPIST: Well, it also seems whether it's Victor, or Henry (sp?) or work, that somehow it even provides you with a sort of reason for existence or a certain kind of basic viability.
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I cannot be any more clear about this; that this is the only thing that I think will make me want to be able to live with myself. Otherwise, if I don't have it; if I don't make it; if I don't get it; if I don't win it; I'll continue to think very lowly of myself. I'm not worth ","P1-N400871":"it. I'm not worth(7 second pause) [00:39:57]
THERAPIST: Well, if you, in a sense, don't feel that your lungs are what allow you to breathe, that it's sort of a respirator which is sort of what you're talking about that there's something outside you that will provide you with viability, you can't help but feel desperate. That's sort of a desperate ","P1-N400891":"state of affairs.
CLIENT: I mean, it's both, isn't it? It's external and internal, right?
THERAPIST: Say more.
CLIENT: Well, because, if I work really hard-I mean, it's not just me working hard obviously. It's going to be up to the others, but I feel like I haven't really given it my all and that is the only thing that makes me-Well, it's enabling and disabling at the same time, I guess. It's enabling because ","P1-N4008F1":"I'm like, "Wait a second. There's still stuff I could do from my end to get what I want." But, then again, it's like, "Oh, it's my fault. It's something lacking in me." And that is really disabling. Because I've talked with others and they're like, "Eh, rejection,. Just ignore it. You don't even know ","P1-N4008F2":"when your stuff might be perfect, but it's just not right for them." You know, it's really hard for me to understand that. But that's what it comes down to. It's not just that my work sucks, it's just that they don't have space for me. But, it's both internal and external. And I'm hoping that[00:41:44]
THERAPIST: What did you feel I was saying? I just-I missed that piece.
CLIENT: Pardon?
THERAPIST: You were saying it's both internal and external. What did you feel I was saying? Because it seems like you were sort of correcting, not correcting but responding to it, so I'm not sure what you thought I was saying when you responded that way?
CLIENT: Like what you were saying, when you talked about lungs. You said it's something external that you want to get. I meant that its external, but it's internal as well, because it's something that I will have produced out of myself. It will be my achievement and my happiness would be based out of ","P1-N400971":"me. You know, it's like I would be the pillar. I would be my own pillar, you know? Which is the reason why no matter what Chris (sp?) did, it didn't make me happy. He couldn't touch this part of me that was really unhappy, because it had nothing to do with him. It wasn't that we didn't have great intimacy. ","P1-N400972":"It wasn't that we didn't have whatever-We had money issues and what not. It was just this big sadness in me that I wasn't able to work hard and I wasn't able to be successful, so this was my pain and I had to do something about it and no one else could help me. So, it's very internal. Is that-I don't ","P1-N400973":"know. Maybe I misunderstood you. [00:43:20]
THERAPIST: No. No. Not at all. In some ways I was thinking, in terms of just what we were saying, that I wonder at moments where you feel so yearning for Victor that it's confusing? Do you need a respirator or can you rely on your lungs? It just gets confusing. [00:43:38]
CLIENT: Well, I guess the yearning for him is quite equivalent to yearning to be successful. (chuckles) It's as bad as that, I guess. But now that I know things are over, I'm a lot less desperate. Because that tap was still open. I could see it. I just needed to get my cup there. I just kept struggling ","P1-N4009B1":"and being desperate because I could see it flowing and I could see that it was on, so I just had to get there. But now that I see that it's shut, it's inaccessible, it's whatever now. Yeah, I guess, okay. (chuckles) But, I still cannot kill that hope that one day it will be open again and I'll be right ","P1-N4009B2":"next to it. [00:44:35]
THERAPIST: Well, that hope and that need and that yearning. I mean, I feel like that's kind of what I want to honor and explore further in here. No one seeks things with such intensity that are inconsequential.
CLIENT: You mean he's inconsequential?
THERAPIST: No, I said no one seeks something so intensely that is inconsequential. Sort of by definition and so, I guess in that sense I want to honor that. Because it's clearly very special.
CLIENT: I wish he'd honor it. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: But, I don't think it's about him. That's the thing.
