DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her dislike for getting lost in other people's worlds. Client also discuses dating two individuals at once, and not knowing exactly what she is doing.
THERAPIST: Hi! Come on in! [00:01:16]
CLIENT: (pause) How are you?
THERAPIST: Sorry?
CLIENT: How are you?
THERAPIST: Good, thank you.
CLIENT: Trying to remember what I, what we talked about last week. (pause) (chuckles) Do you remember? (chuckles) That we picked up from there, so... The break is over, so it’s... I’m going to class tomorrow.
THERAPIST: I’m sorry. I’m having a hard time hearing you today. (client responds) Sorry. (client affirms) It sounds like you’re speaking a little more quietly today, but...
CLIENT: Okay, I’ll try (chuckles) to project my voice. I said the break is, my break is over so... I have to go back to school tomorrow. (therapist affirms) (pause) I feel like I didn’t accomplish what I wanted to during the break. (chuckles) I did have a very (chuckles) idealistic kind ","P1-N4001B1":"of a... plan to... hand over my like, first draft to my professor on the 20th. (chuckles) And you know, it’s like the 27th and I still have like, a third of it left or like... two fifths of it left or something. A quarter... [00:04:23]
THERAPIST: First draft of...?
CLIENT: Of my project, my novel, so... (therapist affirms) (chuckles) A very, very rough one, but you know... Because I got like, I lost ten days, helping my mom and my friend. I had a plan of like, writing a scene every day, and revising the scene every day. (chuckles) Yeah, right! (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Why do you say, “Yeah, right!”
CLIENT: Well, it is very, very like... yeah. I imagine... you know, my professors, not even all my professors, but only very few of my professors are like, are going to be able to stick to that. (chuckles) “That guy over there, he can do it.” (chuckles) Um... But I don’t know. I feel ","P1-N400231":"like not me. I’m too... I’m lazy, but I get easily... buffeted by winds, so... (sighs) Maybe that can be a goal, in a few years from now, that I will be that dedicated and motivated and strong and in control. (chuckles) [00:05:46]
THERAPIST: It sounds like you feel like you get easily lost in other people’s world.
CLIENT: That’s exactly what I was going to say today to you, that I feel like spending one whole day with Nelson is like I was immersed in his world, and I feel very lost and unanchored and like, “Who am I,” you know? Completely, I forget... (pause) I wonder why? Like, is it because ","P1-N400311":"I don’t have a strong sense of self, or...?
THERAPIST: Say more about...?
CLIENT: What you said, you know, I feel lost.
THERAPIST: Lost. (pause) I don’t have, nothing is coming to mind.
CLIENT: I just wondered like, what you were thinking when you said that, so...
THERAPIST: (pause) That. (chuckles)
CLIENT: (pause) (sighs) Well, I don’t know. How do you share... your, not life, not just like, just like even... a few hours a day, you know, with someone else, you know. How do you do that? (pause) Like, watching him clean his apartment and... you know, he owns this place, and you know, whatever ","P1-N4003F1":"and like, is talking to his family back in Nepal and... you know, okay, he’s hungry, so he wants to have bunch now, or you know, he wants tea now (chuckles). [00:11:42]
THERAPIST: Are there times, were there times throughout the day that you thought, “Oh, I could work on my writing for an hour?”
CLIENT: Oh, yeah!
THERAPIST: What prevents you from doing that?
CLIENT: Well, because... you know like... I guess I would just have to, should take like a stronger initiative and been like, “Okay, I’m just walking to my place now, you know. I mean, I need to write, I’ll just go, I’m just walking. See you later.” (chuckles) It was just ","P1-N400471":"like, nebulous, it wasn’t planned. I had a couple of events I could have gone to, that I didn’t; could have done my own stuff... I was like, kept asking him, “When are you leaving? When are you leaving?” He left like really late like, around 10:00, so...
THERAPIST: Well, it also reminds me of your feeling like you got lost in your friend’s PhD application, to the detriment of your own work.
CLIENT: Yeah. I just couldn’t lay down boundaries. Yeah, because I mean, ridiculous of him to be like, “Okay, we have ten days. Help me,” you know? (chuckles) So... But I should, I mean, I did, I tried. I said... “No, you know like, after 5:00, after 5:00, after 5:00.” ","P1-N4004F1":"On some days, you know, we did meet at 4:00, or 3:00... and I got like, a few hours of work done. But yeah, I was like, I did definitely put aside my own plan to do this. I mean, I keep telling myself, “Well, it won’t happen that often, it doesn’t happen that often.” (chuckles) [00:14:38]
THERAPIST: (pause) I was thinking, you know, you usually talk fairly softly. Sometimes, you talk more softly than others, but there is almost a way, even in your like your voice, you make yourself small.
CLIENT: Oh, yeah? Like what?
THERAPIST: Well, that you can be inaudible at times.
CLIENT: (chuckles) I have got that a lot. (chuckles) I get that a lot. [00:15:41]
THERAPIST: Because you make yourself small. “Oh, he has his own house, and he has this and... I am just small and... I have a small voice.”
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I mean... I do do that, I mean, yes. (chuckles) (pause) I don’t have a big... I don’t know, maybe that’s the contradiction of being, feel like I am big sometimes, but then... most of the time, I try to minimize myself. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: And it’s certainly how you feel about yourself. [00:20:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, I don’t know. I feel like it’s changing, I don’t know.
THERAPIST: (affirms) I think that’s true, too. There is your voice!
CLIENT: (chuckles) Is there? No, I mean like...
THERAPIST: That’s a good point!
CLIENT: What’s a good point?
THERAPIST: You said, “I feel it’s changing.” I said, “That’s a good point.”
CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah, but like, staying by myself I think is helping that, I don’t know. You know, again like, it’s hard to be objective about so many things, but... this (inaudible), you know, I feel like that it’s like, my time is my own, my space is my own. Not, I mean, again, ","P1-N400751":"you know, I’ve had times when everyone like, again buffeted by requests for help and requests to stay over. (chuckles) But, when I’m at my, in my room, I feel grounded and you know... And even if I’m lost, it’s like... it’s like a space that I can, a head space that I can ","P1-N400752":"navigate, I think. (pause) I mean, of course, it doesn’t mean that I’ll stay locked in for... I mean, 24\/7. You know, obviously, I need people. But how to get that on my terms a little bit more, I guess.
THERAPIST: Feel more moored.
CLIENT: Yeah. (therapist affirms) (pause) I mean, it’s really like... it’s what David has taught me. I feel (sighs) like his work is, are his moorings. Like, that’s what he’s more into, so... I mean, he does come from a very stable family and like... you know... for generations, ","P1-N400811":"they’ve been stable at a place or, you know... But... so I mean, I feel like that counts for something, too. But... in the present moment, you know, he’s mostly just... his work is his like... core, you know. That’s who he is, what he defines himself by, and his thinking, you know. ","P1-N400812":"So I feel like... for me, that is... that should be my grounding, too. (chuckles) And my mom, I guess. I feel like those are the two things that I feel like, define me, you know. (pause) Or things that I care about.
THERAPIST: How do you mean?
CLIENT: (sighs) I don’t know. I don’t know if I want to get married or not. Mainly, I do; but in that case, I should learn to be... Shouldn’t I also learn to be like... a little less like... I don’t want to say a little less grounded. That doesn’t make sense. Of course, ","P1-N4008B1":"I should be grounded, but... less adamant about my position. I mean, I only am very, very little, very less adamant, so maybe there is no danger of that yet; I don’t know. No danger of being adamant. I don’t know. It could be!
THERAPIST: That you are what?
CLIENT: In a Batmobile like, you don’t, you won’t be lost.
THERAPIST: A Batmobile, you said?
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) So...
THERAPIST: (pause) I just started thinking how Batman was an orphan.
CLIENT: (chuckles) Oh, God! (chuckles) From now on, don’t drink too much! (chuckles) I just meant that, I just like his car. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: It’s protected?
CLIENT: It’s shiny and black, and it can do all sorts of crazy things. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: It can fly, can’t it? [00:38:51]
CLIENT: Something, yeah. (pause) It’s probably like, practically indestructible also. (chuckles) (pause) It’s like the Stealth movie or like, you know, no one can see it, because it’s so fast, or something. (chuckles) No, you want, actually, you want people to see it, because that’s ","P1-N400B11":"like... it’s like the Batmobile, you know. So you want people to see it, because then they’ll be like, “Oh, get off the street, you know. It’s like... It’s the Batmobile coming through!” (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Strong and powerful?
CLIENT: Yeah! (chuckles) (pause) It’s what you project, like you said, you know? Like, what he projects, you know. Okay that’s too many Batman references! (chuckles) I’m thinking of that... the sign, the bat sign, that he projects. (sighs)
THERAPIST: Nelson? (client affirms) And what was he yelling about?
CLIENT: Just the... (sighs) you know it was like, “You said three things that are contradictory,” and whatnot and like, just what the fight was about, me saying that he wasn’t talking to my friends. He was like, “No, they didn’t talk to me. (chuckles) I’m good at ","P1-N400BD1":"this bar conversation.” (chuckles)
THERAPIST: How did you feel about him yelling?
CLIENT: Oh, I didn’t feel good at all! I felt like a little child, you know? Like... you know. And I wanted to walk home. (chuckles) (pause) And I was, you know like, because I’m constantly comparing the two guys. I was like, “David would never do this!” (chuckles) I mean, yeah, ","P1-N400C11":"he has his own ways of making me feel small, but I was like... “He loves me! You know? He’d never yell at me!” (chuckles) Maybe it’s not true. Maybe he has yelled at me, but...
THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?
CLIENT: Oh, the things like... (pause) I don’t know; I guess I feel anxious now, because I’m with Nelson and like, “What are we doing? You know? What is this?” He doesn’t really care about me. He’s just like, using me. (chuckles) (pause) I’m like, “Why ","P1-N400C71":"am I even thinking in these terms? I don’t care. I should focus on myself and my work (chuckles)... (pause) and build my world, you know, according to its own kind of principles. I have nothing to do with... his principles or David’s principles.” Well, I mean, you know, they’re ","P1-N400C72":"probably closer to David’s principles, but... (sighs) [00:44:41]
THERAPIST: But you stay with him.
CLIENT: With who?
THERAPIST: Nelson.
CLIENT: Yeah, well... I can’t figure that piece out. (chuckles) (pause) Sex is complicated. (chuckles) Or it’s not simple. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Yeah, we’re going to need to stop now. (client affirms) So I’ll see you on Wednesday. (client affirms) Okay, great!
CLIENT: Have a good day.
THERAPIST: Thank you.
CLIENT: Bye.
THERAPIST: Bye.
