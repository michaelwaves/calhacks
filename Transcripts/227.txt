CLIENT: How was the marathon on Monday?
THERAPIST: How was it?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: In terms of watching it?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Fine. Thank you. Oh, that’s right. I was a little confused at first. I’m sorry. I didn’t come in for a few reasons. The marathon was one of them. It’s also hard to get here from my house.
CLIENT: Oh okay.
THERAPIST: Often many of the routes are closed.
CLIENT: Oh really? [00:03:01]
THERAPIST: It’s hard to get around. A lot of the roads are closed.
CLIENT: Oh. (PAUSE) I had kind of a weird conversation with my mom last week. (PAUSE) [00:04:00]
THERAPIST: But did she... The fact that she offered to talk about it, about your feelings about it felt different to you.
CLIENT: Yeah. Like she was like someone else, like acting all mature and motherly. If that’s not motherly, then at least like mature and friendly or concerned. (LAUGHTER) So... (PAUSE) She’s like, “I had no idea.” I’m like, “Yeah, you did.” (LAUGHTER) You know? ","P1-N400391":"“I didn’t stop him because I thought he was (inaudible at 00:11:39).” (LAUGHTER) I don’t think so. You know? (PAUSE) My reasoning is like... And I was telling her like, “You were under his spell. You know? He was the biggest child and he did whatever he wanted and you just ","P1-N400392":"let him. So... (PAUSE) I mean, you might have had your reasons. You know, like you might be in love with him or you actually genuinely thought that he was doing it for my own good. But, you know...” (PAUSE) [00:12:11]
THERAPIST: Afraid of?
CLIENT: Well, that’s like... I feel like that’s our foundation for (SIGH) moving forward or our foundation since her breakup. The foundation being that we’re united in hating him. You know? And if that’s not true, then wait. What is the foundation? (LAUGHTER) So... (PAUSE) Maybe ","P1-N400431":"there is a different foundation. Maybe it’s okay for her to be slightly less hateful towards him than me. But... Yeah. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) [00:15:00]
THERAPIST: Well, and you’re not sisters. You have such different roles vis-a-vis him.
CLIENT: Yeah. So? (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: Well, I don’t know. United in hating him sounds like you’re equals or peers or something.
CLIENT: No. But like, you know, companies and different groups are united in a certain position, parties, political parties. They all kind of take a stance on an issue or something. (LAUGHTER) It’s like that. We all voted and yes and this. You know?
THERAPIST: But she chose him and you didn’t.
CLIENT: So? (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Yeah. But you have such different roles vis a vis him.
CLIENT: I understand that. I understand there is a bigger picture and everything and there are nuances and all that. But I’m just saying, you’re supposed to say “yes” when I say, “It’s not okay for him to treat me and you the way he treated us.” You know? [00:16:05]
THERAPIST: Yeah. I certainly don’t mean to say it’s okay to make excuses for his behavior.
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah. I do understand that we’re not sisters and... (PAUSE) ...she’s my mother and she chose him. (LAUGHTER) So... (PAUSE) Yeah. [00:16:55]
THERAPIST: And I guess I say that because sometimes the way you describe it, you sort of see yourself as two children in the situation with a parent that you can’t get away from. You didn’t have the same power, authority. You were much more helpless.
CLIENT: Yeah. But I actually don’t think of myself as helpless in that scenario. I feel like I had a lot of agency. I was living away (inaudible at 00:17:25) agency that I could have that she actually couldn’t. And that kind of... That distance just kind of gave me everything. It gave me ","P1-N4005D1":"power. It gave me like a very different perspective on the scenario that she didn’t have which was why, which was the very reason I kept telling her to leave him. I wasn’t financially dependent on them. I was independent. In fact, he was dependent on me. And I had like... (PAUSE) ...you ","P1-N4005D2":"know, a boyfriend who might as well have been God at that point. You know, he was the voice of reason and he kept saying, you know, “This is ridiculous. This is wrong. Don’t do this. Don’t listen to him.” You know? So... [00:18:11]
THERAPIST: Certainly if you’re loving someone because you feel compelled to. It can be very empowering.
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I just felt like I want my mom to experience that power. You know? I want her to feel this... Even now... I mean, even now that it’s been eleven years. (LAUGHTER) [00:20:11]
THERAPIST: And I guess I brought up sort of the different positions because if she just totally hated him, how could she reconcile with herself why she stayed?
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: I’m not saying that’s a good reason. I’m just... It’s complicated. I mean, you can hate your father but you stayed because what else are you going to do? (PAUSE)
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) [00:23:00]
THERAPIST: Well, and I guess I point it out because it’s very... I mean, your relationship with your mom is just so confusing.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) [00:25:59]
THERAPIST: It’s unclear. Is she your mom? Is she your sister? Is she your twin? Is she your Siamese twin? Is she your daughter? It’s very, very confusing.
CLIENT: Yeah. It is.
THERAPIST: I certainly don’t mean to invalidate your dad’s horrific treatment and your feelings about it.
CLIENT: Yeah. No. I mean, I feel like we could take different roles at different times. (LAUGHTER) I mean, my whole childhood like in Nepal was like she was the mom, no question. I don’t think I think of her, I thought of her as a sibling or a daughter at that point. But the roles really did reverse ","P1-N400851":"when we came here. I mean, she was still the mom the first year maybe. But then it really switched very quickly and that’s kind of understandable with immigrants. So like, you know... (PAUSE) [00:27:00]
THERAPIST: Well, it’s loaded because, yes, that’s absolutely true of immigrants and then just given the nature of your family’s relationships to each other.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: There’s a lot going on. I mean, I certainly agree. That is very common for immigrant.
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah. I mean, I... I mean, what do I say? Is it unhealthy for her to feel like my daughter? (LAUGHTER) I don’t think so. Right? Because like people’s dynamics can be complicated. Like, at some point, your parents do become like your children. Right? Like when they’re ","P1-N4008D1":"really old, you do have to take care of them like you take care of a child. Right? So... (PAUSE) I don’t know. I guess I’m trying to prepare myself for like that or just the fact that it is a complicated relationship and how do I respect that or live with that or make the best of it or even ","P1-N4008D2":"make it, you know, fruitful. You know? [00:28:09]
THERAPIST: Well, I don’t think complicated is inherently unhealthy.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I think it can be very confusing and I do think, at times, it really brings up feelings for you. I mean, you have feelings in other areas. You’re wanting people to take care of you in ways that you’re not. And I do think that’s a carryover from feelings (inaudible at 00:28:27) mom.
CLIENT: That’s true.
THERAPIST: So, in some ways (inaudible at 00:28:31) but there are some byproducts of that (LAUGHTER) that you struggle with.
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it’s definitely good or necessary to understand these byproducts. I don’t understand them. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) Yeah. Can you help me? (LAUGHTER) [00:28:55]
THERAPIST: Well, I’d like to. I’d like to continue to.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: When, you said, “Can you help me,” was that sort of a general comment or...
CLIENT: No. Just like how do I understand these byproducts? How do I... (PAUSE) Like I definitely have this like... Now, I feel like it’s pressing and as the months go by will feel more and more pressing. I don’t know what to do about next year. (LAUGHTER) I’m trying to make a plan ","P1-N400A11":"as rationally as I can. Like number one, like... All these options... Like who do I live with? What do I do about housing for next year? I’m looking at (inaudible at 00:29:41) (LAUGHTER) housing. And I told you about the counter, the offers and the counter offers. Like...
THERAPIST: No. You mentioned in passing something of the sort, offering. But no, I haven’t heard about this.
CLIENT: No. It’s just like... So Chris (ph) says I can live at his place for no rent or like very little rent. He’s going away for half the year. [00:30:05]
THERAPIST: Oh, is he? For how long?
CLIENT: Just half the year. (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: Because you were also saying that he wants to sort of make a clean break or not over the summer. So...
CLIENT: Yeah. He’s all over the place. He wants that and he wants that. And we had a nice talk just over the phone last weekend or last week and we want to do couples therapy. (LAUGHTER) So it’s just like all over the place. But I told Nelson (ph) about Chris’s offer and she was like, ","P1-N400AD1":"“My ex-boyfriend says I can live with him rent free.” So he was like, “Here’s a counter offer. (LAUGHTER) You live here but you pay me, you know, some rent.” So... (PAUSE) (LAUGHTER) But... And just not that I cannot be, you know, independent, that word we talked about ","P1-N400AD2":"earlier. You know, like... I think he said in, I don’t know, reference to that or just generally this term came up that session that I’m not there yet. (LAUGHTER) [00:31:07]
THERAPIST: Well, I’m not sure if this is how your mom felt but it comes from a feeling you need to be with someone because you’re helpless and you need their specific help.
CLIENT: Specific help?
THERAPIST: Like, “Oh, I don’t have anywhere to live. I’ve got to get back with Chris.”
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: “I need a man to provide me with housing.” (PAUSE)
CLIENT: Well, then I don’t have to worry about, you know, money. (LAUGHTER) It has a lot of other perks too, you know, like be back on the marriage track and be, you know, have this companionship and we can cook together and stuff. [00:33:03]
THERAPIST: Yeah. It does... I mean, you certainly use other people to compare yourself and often compare yourself downward. You often... You also look at people for models although you make a lot of assumptions in that model. You have no idea. She could be paying all the rent for all you know. You have ","P1-N400CB1":"no idea. So you make a lot of assumptions about what that relationship is like and how he’s really like Chris. And so, in a sense, it’s a projection. I’m not sure how much you’re learning because you’re projecting onto them something that you, that’s familiar to you ","P1-N400CB2":"already. So it’s not exactly new information.
CLIENT: What would be new information?
THERAPIST: Actually knowing what the situation is. You don’t really know her boyfriend. You don’t know what the situation is.
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: Assuming when two people move in together, even when one person makes more money that that person’s probably taking care of all the expenses, in this day and age, I do not think is a good assumption. [00:40:05]
CLIENT: Really?
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: I’m not saying it doesn’t happen. I’m just... I wouldn’t assume that.
CLIENT: Why not?
THERAPIST: Because it’s not typical. Out of a small sample size of couples but enough, that’s not typical. It’s not typical for one person to not be contributing to the household at all.
CLIENT: You mean like with money?
THERAPIST: Yeah. Certainly not in dating situations. It’s not typical. It happens. I’m not saying it never happens. But...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: There’s usually some financial contribution. (PAUSE)
CLIENT: I don’t know. (LAUGHTER) [00:41:01]
THERAPIST: Did he seem more attractive when?
CLIENT: I was paying rent. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) It’s not a fair question (inaudible at 00:41:41) I just met him and all of that. So... (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: How does it feel to be part of a bidding war? [00:42:01]
CLIENT: A bidding war? What does that mean?
THERAPIST: With the housing. You were saying that there were offers and counter offers. Offers and counter offers are part of bidding wars.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) I just feel like a prize horse. (LAUGHTER) No. I don’t know. I just hadn’t thought about it that way. I just feel confused and I feel like (inaudible at 00:42:31). This is not supposed to happen. It’s wrong. So... (PAUSE) I guess I feel anxious. So...
THERAPIST: Do you feel taken care of?
CLIENT: Mmm... (PAUSE) No. (LAUGHTER) I mean, I feel kind of like, “Okay, there are options. Yeah.” But like... No. I feel like I still need to do the work myself, you know? I mean, if I live with Chris, it still doesn’t change a lot of the things that bother me. Like I might feel ","P1-N400FD1":"coddled or like... [00:43:15]
THERAPIST: We’ve got a couple minutes.
CLIENT: Yeah. I actually project myself like being there which is very different from when I’m actually there. (LAUGHTER) But if I think about myself being there, I’m like, “That’s the table. My table was right there.” (inaudible at 00:43:35) She sat in my chair and she ","P1-N401031":"touched my computer and the light was like that in the room at the time. You know? Like I’m freaking out and it’s like... I want to take my laptop out there and... I totally don’t imagine, can’t imagine sitting and writing in that room at all even though I wrote in that room ","P1-N401032":"for months. [00:43:59]
THERAPIST: Are you referring to Nepal?
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So I’m just trying to imagine that even if I do take up the offer, the offer of living with him, it’s not really attractive because a lot of things have come to corrupt the nice picture. I mean, it’s a beautiful place because I made it beautiful. But it’s not beautiful to me anymore.
THERAPIST: Since moving out?
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) I want something new. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) I mean, I like this. I like the hustle of walking from my place over to various peoples’ places. [00:45:03]
THERAPIST: A marriage track with Chris?
CLIENT: Or... Either one of them. You know? (PAUSE) (SIGH) But we do want to do couples therapy. I think it will be nice for like further closure on things. I don’t know. I’m so totally confused. It’s like one day I like him. Yesterday, I liked (inaudible at 00:46:01). (LAUGHTER) [00:46:03]
THERAPIST: Well, we will continue to do so. We need to stop for today.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So I will see you on Monday.
CLIENT: Alright.
THERAPIST: Okay great.
CLIENT: Sounds good. Have a good weekend.
THERAPIST: Okay. Thank you very much. Take care.
