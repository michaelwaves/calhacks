TITLE: Client "L" Therapy Session Audio Recording, April 17, 2013: Client discusses philosophical and theoretical issues about gun control and jobs in America.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses philosophical and theoretical issues about gun control and jobs in America.
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in.
CLIENT: Good morning.
THERAPIST: Good morning.
CLIENT: So I think we left off last time with the suggestion that I was reasoning about you as if you were a member of a class and not a specific person.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: So I want to apologize if that has upset you at all. I mean I don't think it really has, but you know. I do see you as a person and I also reason about you perhaps not in a fashion commensurate with that, so, I'm sorry. [00:00:54]
THERAPIST: I wasn't taking offense to it. I hope you know that on some level.
CLIENT: Oh no, no, I think, I was pretty sure that you were not taking offense to that, but then I think I feel like I can still wrong you whether you take offense to it or not. Does that make sense? [00:01:11]
THERAPIST: Yes you do. I'm getting to know that about you.
CLIENT: (laughing)
THERAPIST: That's actually a part of the point I was making. That you sort of see things very much in principle constructs and then extrapolate to the people involved. Not only just in that direction, but you do think about things in principle construct. So if you violate a principle, it matters just ","P1-N4001F1":"as much or at least somewhat in term, in you know, in comparison to violating my feelings personally. Does that make sense?
CLIENT: Yes. No, I think that's, that's, I think that's about right. There's also other things going on in the specific case like coming in to our relationship. I have no idea what to expect and so I sort of look to estimate what to expect from other examples that I have. And so to some extent that's ","P1-N400211":"a useful thing because it gives me some expectation value. But I think at some point that also becomes not a good thing. [00:02:26]
THERAPIST: I think I understand. I may need an example, but I'm understanding where you're going.
CLIENT: Yeah. So imagine a world where we're just putting up stop signs for the first time. Everyone we can stopped at the stop signs, but when implementing that decision, the persons implementing it should be aware that although everyone can, not everyone necessarily will. And because people have their ","P1-N4002D1":"own choice to make in that circumstance, the person putting up the signs cannot do anything to make everyone stop there. In some sense, it's not a great example, but, there is a [00:05:17]
THERAPIST: Well, what are the subtle problems?
CLIENT: Well there is a lot of them, but I'm not sure all of them actually matter. So (pause) so one of the problems is that (pause) so he gives the example of the prisoner's dilemma. Are you familiar? Okay. And so he says that there is (pause) the ideal solution to that problem doesn't matter. That ","P1-N400351":"it's the system optimal solution for both persons. Keep silent, is not the ideal one in a justice sense. Because no one can expect people to act in that fashion. Or I guess he might say more importantly like in making the decision you cannot control what the other person will do. And so you have to ","P1-N400352":"make the decision that will be best for your regardless. [00:07:43]
THERAPIST: Well your reasoning assumes that someone is thinking like you, or something, right? That's what you said at the beginning.
CLIENT: Yeah, something like that, yeah. Now clearly I know that since I cannot convince anyone else this, no one else is reasoning in this fashion, so that should change my calculations also. But fortunately the real world doesn't have prisoner's dilemmas in any like strictly meaningful sense because ","P1-N400491":"in the real world we actually have all of these other perimeters to our utility function. We actually care about other things besides how much jail time we get. [00:13:15]
THERAPIST: Except for Brown grad students where jail time is taxes.
CLIENT: (laughing)
CLIENT: (laughing) Yeah. Putting the word immediate in front of self interest makes that much simpler. Yeah. I (long pause) That's what I think this guy was arguing ultimately is that in designing any system or designing how we ought to interact with any system, we have to take in to account that ","P1-N400531":"people are going to behave in that fashion. And they're always going to behave in that fashion. [00:14:31]
THERAPIST: What part of it?
CLIENT: (laugh) Umm I don't have any particular preference. If there's a (laugh) part of it that jumps out then that would be, that's fine. I'm just curious what you think. [00:16:03]
THERAPIST: Well, I'd like, well I have several thoughts. One thought is clearly you thought a lot about what we talked about last time and especially how we ended the session. I guess you might that was on your mind.
CLIENT: Absolutely.
CLIENT: Oh yeah. Yeah. [00:16:25]
THERAPIST: I ask in part because I'm just you know just curious about how you think about some things and how you process them. And it seems like you think very deeply about things or across many different areas.
CLIENT: Yes. I'm not sure that's a good thing, but it's what (laugh) I do. And I think for some people crossing the street is just crossing the street. But [00:16:50]
THERAPIST: Do you feel like it works against you at times at least?
CLIENT: (long pause) I don't know. (pause) Yes. There are definitely times that it works against me. It makes it very hard to interact with new people.
THERAPIST: How?
CLIENT: Because, I'm very aware that I think about the world differently than most people. And I have very different interests from most people. And so it's (long pause) [00:18:03]
THERAPIST: You don't think people want to face that?
CLIENT: No. I mean they want to face if by, in the same way we all want to face it by like making themselves safe. But you can't make yourself safe. My wife wants to kill herself. She's going to do it. Like (pause) the safety we desire is illusory. It does not exist. (long pause) They turned around ","P1-N4007F1":"one of the planes flying out of Reagan because there were non-white people on it effectively. There were some runners there who were scared by some people who looked Middle Eastern and may not have been speaking in English. But were not sitting anywhere near each other. [00:23:44]
THERAPIST: So you feel that people have a false sense of safety in general that you don't feel?
CLIENT: (long pause) Absolutely. Have you ever watched people drive on the interstate? They (laugh) drive as if they cannot die. Or as if their actions could not possibly have the consequences of their deaths. [00:25:47]
THERAPIST: How?
CLIENT: Despite drivers education including a great deal of information on stopping distances and the relation between stopping distance and speed. And in a sense their physics classes in high school also discussing the relation between stopping distances and speed and following too closely, and cut ","P1-N4008B1":"people off. [00:26:06]
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: Yeah, absolutely. Do I think that extends to everywhere in their lives? Umm, yeah, but it's not as false everywhere right? So walking down the streets in Andover is fairly safe. Like particularly in daylight. Like it's just, it's not that unsafe, so the sense in which it's false is not very large. [00:26:37]
THERAPIST: Well it's false if there are bombs here too.
CLIENT: Sure. Sure. And there could always be bombs. Absolutely. Again the likelihood is low. But (pause) it's a but what do you do about bombs right? There's nothing you can do. Well literally nothing. In the case of driving, not only do you have the false, does one have a false sense of security, ","P1-N400931":"like one's false sense of security is actually like actively increasing the odds that someone else is going to get hurt. So they're (pause) [00:27:30]
THERAPIST: Do you think since Tanya's been suicidal, you're sense of feeling unsafe has increased? Have these issues been heightened in any way?
CLIENT: I don't want to feel that way, but that doesn't mean it's not true.
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: So I'm not sure. (long pause) She's also been suicidal off and on for like a year and a half or longer, so it's a little hard to remember. Long before that I was, you know there was a pretty real sense in which I was a different person. For reasons entirely unrelated to that. Like it I just ","P1-N4009B1":"was while ago, so I don't know. [00:28:33]
THERAPIST: Well it came to my mind also in terms of your talking about it, is just that the awareness you have seems like it putting such a burden, a certain weight on you.
CLIENT: (long pause) Yeah, that's right. That's right.
THERAPIST: In a way that it sounds like you can't share with other people because they don't understand, they think differently.
CLIENT: Yeah, it's not that I can't share it with anyone ever, but yeah I have a sense in talking with most people that (pause) they are not aware of the majority of it, they are not aware of the depth of the majority of the issues that surround us such that you know I believe we were talking before ","P1-N400A31":"about could I educate people to be chemists. I mean you said well bet they, or something like that, it's not a direct quote, but something like they should be able to make their own choices, I shouldn't be making their choices for them. But (pause) but it's not a very meaningful to make a choice if ","P1-N400A32":"it's not a fully informed choice or if it means something but it (long pause) [00:30:41]
THERAPIST: What do you feel?
CLIENT: I'm trying to figure out what to do, (laugh) but I didn't so, I don't know. So it would be very simple if I were only good at one thing. Just do that. Right? But, that's not the case, so it's harder. Because then it's like looking for a global or at least local minimum all across several hundred ","P1-N400B11":"variables and that's not a mathematically tractable problem across two variables, so. Across several hundred is just overwhelming. And in a sense impossible. And so there's not even a, like I don't even have a good way of. And so this gets us back to like well what do you do? Or what do you want to ","P1-N400B12":"do? Because that would be another way to solve this, is to do what I want to do. But if I want to do the optimal thing, then we're back in this like, well I can't do the optimal thing, so what else do I want? [00:36:15]
THERAPIST: How did you end up with this burden?
CLIENT: (long pause) That's a fascinating question. I don't know. I don't know. (long pause) I feel like there's a sense in which you from two months ago, might argue that I took it on myself. And that might be I'm painting you unfairly, but it [00:37:40]
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: But I think that then the question is how did I become the person that takes on that burden? Why am I who I am? I don't know. (sigh) It's an interesting question but I don't really know how to tackle it. [00:38:03]
THERAPIST: Um-hum. And so when you said festinating, what came to mind about fascinating?
CLIENT: Well it's just really interesting. It's not the question that I, it is not a question that I had thought about.
THERAPIST: Umm.
CLIENT: So, I think it's a good question and I find questions that are hard, interesting. So that was it's more just a (laugh) that's a very different way of responding then I would have thought to. [00:38:30]
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: (long pause) So like I got to Texas A&M and I found a system that was streamlined to take care of the like middle 80 percent of students really well. Although I wasn't really in the middle 80 percent of students. And so (long pause) I don't know, I said it was one of the first places I recognized, ","P1-N400C71":"like sort of systemic problems that, that (pause) come from well intentioned people interacting in ways that aren't necessarily ideal or something like that. I'm not sure that's really it. [00:40:12]
THERAPIST: And systemic problems that not everybody was taken care of, just 80 percent?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I mean to this. Yeah. Absolutely that's a problem. And there was also my sense that in aiming to take care of the middle 80 percent, one is not succeeding in taking care of the middle 80 percent. Unless there was like pitched the level of every class to some average value which has ","P1-N400CB1":"the effect of kind of maintaining the average value or something like that so. [00:40:46]
THERAPIST: So it's not like try to take care of 80 percent it's not simply taking 80 percent of the people and taking care of them, but it's kind of creating 80 percent if they're pitching classes.
CLIENT: Something like that, yeah. It's yeah. Yes. And at the time like (pause) you know I felt like this was the failure of the administrators and individual professors and things like this, at least at the beginning. But you know I developed a close relationship with my faculty adviser over, through ","P1-N400D11":"doing research, so sort of in a sense working outside of this classroom system. And I know a lot more faculty members as a graduate student, it's just, they're very well intentioned people who are very busy. And they're working very hard to do what they think is best, but they can't solve every problem. ","P1-N400D12":"They (pause) they just do what they do. [00:42:08]
THERAPIST: Well I guess my question, I don't want to break it down in some ways because it's a very like, it's a, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. But I'm wondering sort of like how you developed into the person to have the awareness and\/or motivation to see these things. And then maybe ","P1-N400D71":"that actually is just a different way of just putting it. Of breaking it down. Like how did that evolve?
CLIENT: (long pause) I don't know. (very long pause) Yeah, I'm not even sure how to (pause) I have no sense of the single defining moment in my life when that like, I'm changed to doing that, I just (long pause) Because even at the time at Texas A&M, like the part of the frustration was not just that ","P1-N400D91":"like my needs were not being met and this higher education thing that I had been expecting had ended up being something entirely different. It was this sense that if it was something entirely different, this was not just a problem for me. [00:45:43]
THERAPIST: Hum.
CLIENT: This was a problem for everyone else who was involved.
THERAPIST: Well why didn't you tell the people who know that? I guess that's the question?
CLIENT: Well some close friends that I had did know that. They had their own problems, my assistant, Tanya, and my friend Franco, among them. (long pause) I think it's easy to be a part of the system and want to do well in it. (long pause) Yeah. [00:47:10]
THERAPIST: Well, I'm going to need to leave you with this question for this week. We can talk about it more next week. I realize we need to stop for today.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I need to involve you in the process, do you agree.
CLIENT: Thanks you.
THERAPIST: Okay. Take care, I'll see you next week.
CLIENT: Okay.
