TITLE: Client "S" Therapy Session Audio Recording, January 06, 2014: Client wonders if she is destructive in her life, as she keeps ruining her friendships and relationships.
DESCRIPTION: Client wonders if she is destructive in her life, as she keeps ruining her friendships and relationships.
THERAPIST: Hi! [00:00:30]
CLIENT: I guess I should hang this outside? It’s all wet!
THERAPIST: It’s up to you. I’m sure there is a (inaudible) outside.
CLIENT: Almost like, everything wet! (ph) (door opens, pause) How are you?
THERAPIST: Good, thank you.
CLIENT: Such a mess! (wiping something up)
THERAPIST: What do you think made you call Chris right away, after seeing Nelson?
CLIENT: Well, it was building up. I hadn’t really talked to him in like, twenty days. He said, “It’s been twenty days” (therapist responds) like, since before Christmas. (sighs) So... mostly, it was because Nelson was in town or on break and like, but also because I didn’t, ","P1-N400261":"I wanted to stay at my place more, so... (therapist responds)
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: It’s like, they’re all wet! (laughs)
THERAPIST: Oh, go ahead. [00:08:18]
CLIENT: Just that, my mom would always tell me that I’m a destructive person and have destructive tendencies. So I was, in that context, I was thinking like, “Why did I destroy, you know, my relationship with Chris? Why didn’t I... You know, why did I do that like, two years ago? Why ","P1-N400321":"was I so unhappy?” There was really no concrete reason to be that unhappy. I didn’t like, you know, have a disaster happen to me, you know. I just created it, this disaster thing. I mean, I just went ahead and destroyed like, our little home. I mean, I wasn’t happy in it and I was, ","P1-N400322":"it wasn’t like a sweet little home, you know. But I was quite unhappy, so that’s why I destroyed it, but it’s still kind of, feel like that’s what I did. (therapist responds) You know, I don’t know if that narrative is (sighs) accurate or sufficient or helpful or (inaudible) ","P1-N400323":"(chuckles). Chris was like, “Don’t blame yourself; you’re doing that again.” And I’m like, “I don’t know how else to think of it.”
THERAPIST: You’ve just talked about wanting more responsibility, and then you’re asking me what I think. Is it...?
CLIENT: No, no, no it’s not that! It’s just like, I’m just wondering, because... Is it... I’m a bit confused about like, how much do you... not blame other people, but like... If you have a conflict with someone, if they make, if you want them to change their behavior, how much ","P1-N4003A1":"of that is on you, and how much of that is on them? (therapist responds) And if I find Chris boring, how much (chuckles) of that can I expect to change and how much of that is like, in my own head, in my own experience, my own feeling that I should be able to take care of? You know? [00:11:19]
THERAPIST: That’s a very good question.
CLIENT: I don’t know how to... I guess it depends on, on people to people.
THERAPIST: (pause) You said your mother always said you had a destructive personality. How do you mean?
CLIENT: I don’ t know. I guess I had anger issues, even when I was a child. I’d just like, throw things (chuckles). Yeah, I guess that’s what she meant. Like, spend time just breaking things or, yeah. Instead of building things, or drawing... (therapist responds)
THERAPIST: (pause) It seems to take your behavior out of context. I imagine you were reacting to what was going on around you. [00:12:28]
CLIENT: I was, yeah, (chuckles) subconsciously. I mean consciously.
THERAPIST: I mean, I’m saying it’s a... I’m sorry to interrupt.
CLIENT: Yeah, no. Yeah, consciously.
THERAPIST: I mean, saying it’s a part of your personality is... different than thinking about your behavior as a response to what was going on around you.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, she just said tendencies. I guess that’s what she was saying, tendencies.
THERAPIST: Do you think she sees herself that way, too? That she has destructive tendencies?
CLIENT: No, she would say that she tries to be as constructive and creative as possible, which is probably true. She does, actually. (chuckles) She does spend a lot of time making things, just because she has the skills. Like, her mother passed that, all those skills on to her like, stitching and embroidery, ","P1-N400521":"you know. I don’t do any of those (chuckles), so... (sighs)
THERAPIST: Is that what it feels like?
CLIENT: It’s (inaudible) thinking about it. (chuckles) Like I said, I don’t know if it’s accurate or helpful, taking the blame, or whatever.
THERAPIST: Well, I mean, the way, one way in which it doesn’t make sense is you weren’t happy with him. (client responds) And so, at least, I mean, I’m not... That sounds more global than I meant it, because, well, but you weren’t. I mean, there were many ways in which you weren’t ","P1-N4005C1":"happy. So to break up something you weren’t happy with doesn’t really fit with “destructiveness.”
CLIENT: Yeah. What is destructiveness?
THERAPIST: (pause) I don’t know. It’s your word! (chuckles)
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know, just felt like, maybe, if you destroy something that was built by someone, by you, you know. Undoing this, un-made the sweater (chuckles) you know? [00:15:38]
THERAPIST: I mean, it seems more destructive to be dating people while you’re with him than it is to break up with him. That seems destructive, because what purp , like what good things can come of it? (client affirms) Your...
CLIENT: But now it’s destructive both ways, with us (ph) like... You know, because we both have... (chuckles) What were you going to say?
THERAPIST: Maybe. I mean, I don’t know if feelings can be destructive. I think of behavior as destructive, more than feelings.
CLIENT: Oh... yeah.
THERAPIST: Your feelings are what your feelings are.
CLIENT: But that’s, that’s so, that, yeah. That’s a good point. So that’s what I’m trying to control and... not seeing Chris, like not sleeping with him, is Step One. Step Two is (chuckles) not staying at his place. (therapist responds) So those two I’m trying to ","P1-N4006E1":"take care of. Step Three, like completely shutting off contact is very hard. Now, if I were a stronger person, a true (ph) person, I would do that, but that’s the thing that I’m struggling with, and that’s the thing that I don’t even think isn’t necessary or I can do it, so... [00:16:59]
THERAPIST: Yeah. Which is why it’s not clear why it’s destructive.
CLIENT: What is destructive?
THERAPIST: Well, yeah. It’s not clear why... I mean, you feel like cutting off contact with Chris would be constructive?
CLIENT: I guess.
THERAPIST: I’m not sure how you’re getting there.
CLIENT: I don’t think it was constructive. I guess, so yeah, you said, behavior can be destructive. So, yeah, seeing him would be destructive, yeah. But...
THERAPIST: Because...?
CLIENT: Because he’ll confuse me and keep me in this limbo state. But... yeah. But I feel like I have a need to see him like, yeah. Yeah. (chuckles) (pause) I mean, I didn’t want to see him at all, actually. And then my mom invited him and other people to her place. I was actually like... ","P1-N4007E1":"almost going to say to her, “Don’t invite him!” I don’t know, I, in fact, tried, I texted him and said, “Are you going to go?” He was like, “Yeah, it will be fun!” I was like, “Damn!” (chuckles) [00:18:22]
THERAPIST: Why did you think he was right?
CLIENT: Because he’s smart! He’s right!
THERAPIST: He’s right about, he knows everything?
CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) Not everything, I don’t think. But he’s pretty smart! (therapist responds) (pause) I don’t know. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Maybe it’s important for you to think he knows everything.
CLIENT: Yeah, it is. (therapist responds) But why?
THERAPIST: That’s a good question. (client chuckles)
CLIENT: I don’t know. It’s just like... I’m trying, I mean, I know I’ve made like, a mess, but I don’t want to think about it that way and beat myself up too much, because... you know (chuckles) I guess I just want to take a step back, and maybe even laugh at the situation. ","P1-N400961":"I don’t, I don’t do that very often. I beat myself up and I feel bad, so... It’s nice to, to humor myself a little bit? I don’t know like, I actually, genuinely sometimes just feel lucky that... you know, I (chuckles) I have these, you know, two great guys, you know, who care ","P1-N400962":"about me, you know. Sure, they’ll be mad as hell (chuckles) if they knew certain things, but... (pause) They kind of do and they kind of don’t need to know certain details. I don’t know. But I just, yeah, like (sighs) since I’m unable to like, have... Like, I don’t have ","P1-N400963":"a family or siblings, you know, it’s just, it’s nice to have some people (chuckles) who care, you know? (therapist responds) (pause) Because I care about them, too, I guess, so it’s just like, it’s been reciprocated. I’m lucky that they do. [00:23:49]
THERAPIST: You feel guilty because you feel you led her on?
CLIENT: Yeah... And disappointing her.
THERAPIST: I don’t know what you mean by “happy on your own.”
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: I don’t know what you mean by “happy on your own.”
CLIENT: I’ll be happy on my own! Like I said like, take more responsibility.
THERAPIST: And so how will you, would you be delu ... I guess I don’t understand “am I deluding myself by thinking I can be happy on my own.”
CLIENT: No, no. By thinking that I’ll get back with him.
THERAPIST: Oh, I see. I wasn’t sure what the “deluding” was.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I don’t know if I’m deluding... (sighs)
THERAPIST: Do you feel scared to think that you know things other people don’t know? [00:29:26]
CLIENT: (pause) What?? (chuckles) Like...?
THERAPIST: Well, I had a couple of thoughts. Like, that you might know things like, you might understand about a T , you might have a perspective on a TV show that Chris just doesn’t know or understand, for example. Or even when you ask me... Well, the reason why I asked it at that moment is ","P1-N400BE1":"like, you asked me questions about your emotional life that I, I don’t have the answers to, but I think you do.
CLIENT: Yeah. And that scares me?
THERAPIST: Well, I was wondering. I was wondering if there is something that is sort of hard to, hard about that.
CLIENT: Talking about me knowing more? (therapist affirms) What, I never thought (ph) about it. [00:30:10]
THERAPIST: Well, because you look to people so much, to sort of be sort of experts or oracles or... (client affirms) And to think of other people as that way, and more of yourself as someone who could have answers.
CLIENT: I’m thinking. I’ve never... You know, why, I’m like, why would that scare me, that I know more? Wouldn’t that, wouldn’t it better, you know? Yeah, I’m trying to think if that’s the case (chuckles). (pause) What if I’m wrong? Yeah, maybe that’s ","P1-N400CC1":"the scary bit.
THERAPIST: Well, but you could be as wrong as anybody else.
CLIENT: It’s (inaudible) (blocked) Yeah but that’s scary!
THERAPIST: That you could be wrong or that anyone could be wrong? [00:31:14]
CLIENT: Well, me (chuckles) first. Like, yeah, I was watching this documentary and... I got into it because Nelson was like, “This is interesting.” And I was like, “Yeah, yeah; it looks interesting!” And then I was like, watching it and I was not that interested in it, but I ","P1-N400D41":"didn’t quite know what was wrong until Chris was like, “Yeah, it’s reductive!” He didn’t say reductive, you know, whatever he said like, Yeah. So... I guess he put his finger on the thing that was bothering me, but then I was also like, a little disappointed that he didn’t ","P1-N400D42":"like it, because... I don’t know. Maybe this is a bad example, but like... (pause) But like yeah, I mean like, (sighs) if you like something and the other person, or everyone else knows that it’s something bad for you, or just generally bad, it’s like, it’s scary. [00:32:34]
THERAPIST: But I don’t know. How would bad be determined? It’s just different people’s opinion, in the end.
CLIENT: Yeah, but... I don’t know. Now I can’t think (chuckles). (pause) I’m just still not comfortable with the idea that different people have different opinions, and that’s fine. It’s not fine. I want to take different people’s opinions and order them, you know, ","P1-N400D81":"into a hierarchy, evaluate them (chuckles). I don’t know why. (therapist responds) I feel more comfortable when I do that. (therapist responds) Like, I can orient myself (chuckles). This democracy thing doesn’t work for me. [00:33:45]
THERAPIST: Well, you can order them, but they’re ultimately your ordering.
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that could be one thing that I have to learn, to keep my order to myself, or just know that other people have ordered things differently. (therapist responds) I mean, that is something that I am starting to learn, because I was, you know, completely in my shell until two years ","P1-N400DC1":"ago and, you know, broke out of it to really just, experience new things, and I am. (chuckles) (therapist responds) So... that has been like, you know, being with Nelson first and then now like, Nelson and his friends, you know. I still, I mean, I went in and I (inaudible). But it’s less and less ","P1-N400DC2":"now, and there is more affection now. [00:34:49]
THERAPIST: You have a minute or so. Did you think of something?
CLIENT: Yeah, but it’s like, it’s probably going to take longer. (therapist responds) (pause) Yeah, I mean, so I don’t know if you can answer this question, but I feel like perhaps it would be helpful to think of breaking up with Chris as coming to something constructive. (therapist ","P1-N400EA1":"responds) I mean, I keep thinking that, “Oh, God! I destroyed everything I had and built from scratch!” But then, there is building on that, you know? Rebuilding your life, right? I mean (chuckles)... So... Like, looking at it as something I destroyed, but then, there is, you know like, ","P1-N400EA2":"not wanting to live with my mom, not wanting to live with Chris could be seen as, you know like, needing to grow, and growth is constructive. [00:40:37]
THERAPIST: I never thought... I mean, whether you want to be with Chris or not is one issue, but it never seemed like breaking up with him itself was destructive, because you weren’t happy. So you were trying to do something about it. When people’s motivations are very mixed and complicated, ","P1-N400EC1":"it’s not one thing or the other. But I certainly don’t see your breaking up with Chris as purely destructive. (client responds) Again, I saw you... and again, even this is not purely destructive, but you staying with Chris and then seeing these other guys is far more destructive than you ","P1-N400EC2":"deciding to leave him.
CLIENT: Yeah. Which is funny, because this feels more destructive, because there is so much emptiness and loneliness (inaudible).
THERAPIST: Well, it might be more difficult. (client chuckles) Being difficult and being destructive are not the same thing. (client affirms) You know what, we need to stop. I will see you on Wednesday!
CLIENT: Wednesday.
THERAPIST: Okay, great!
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Okay, take care.
CLIENT: Have a good day.
THERAPIST: Thank you; you, too!
