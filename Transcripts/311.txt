DESCRIPTION: Client discusses a dream she had about her father and how his actions had a negative impact on her and her mother's lives. Client discusses possibly adding another weekly therapy session.
THERAPIST: Hi. (pause)
CLIENT: How are you?
THERAPIST: [Good, thanks].
CLIENT: Were you okay during the whole thing?
THERAPIST: Yeah, I was fine. Thank you for asking. And you?
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of (pause) scary because my mom lives in Cheshire. Like two blocks away from her was where the it all happened, and so she saw like all the police cars and heard gunshots and stuff. (pause)
THERAPIST: I'm sorry, go on.
CLIENT: No, I dream about him coming back and it scares me. (pause)
THERAPIST: In the dream, he bombed the place or you were worried he would?
CLIENT: I don't know. I can't remember very specifically, but I just felt like he was there to harm me. I don't know specifically what it was, that he just did something that harmed me. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well, clearly there's some association between him and the men who bombed the marathon, that he too would bomb. There's some association that he's a dangerous person.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Capable of a very destructive act.
CLIENT: Yeah, he's always been like on the edge. Like he wasn't he hasn't he wouldn't hit me and stuff. I don't know if he actually how many other people -
THERAPIST: It sounds like it.
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean -
THERAPIST: It doesn't sound like he really sort of saw you guys as people he should come home to and take care of in any way.
CLIENT: Oh, absolutely not. It was actually the opposite. That he felt like he hadn't married, he hadn't a child, and he lied about it from the beginning. Like he wasn't there for six years anyway and then when he came back, he again started having affairs and I guess a lot of men do that. I know (chuckles) ","P1-N4006B1":"people sleep around and have affairs, but he would take it a few steps further, like he got really emotionally involved with this one student of his. She wanted to marry him and this and that, and she turned out to be a drama queen. So he took her to a different part of the country and he wanted to ","P1-N4006B2":"marry her. My mom was like "Yeah, I guess I'll step aside and you guys can do what you want."
THERAPIST: Why do you think he kept coming back? Like when you were six, do you know why he came back?
CLIENT: [There are] theories or reasons, my mom says, but (pause) I think she was always willing to take him back. Like she always she hadn't cut that connection, you know. She hadn't emotionally disconnected from him. I don't know if they were legally married. I think they had legally separated ","P1-N400751":"but still like, I mean, I guess he needed a family. I mean, we were his family on paper. I mean, biologically, I think. (chuckles) (pause) Why do you -
THERAPIST: Because what you're saying, like he wanted to be single, he wanted to, you know, be free I mean, why come back?
CLIENT: Mmmm.
THERAPIST: I imagine there is a reason because he did. So I wasn't sure if I wasn't understanding something culturally or legally.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It's just not clear.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't think there were any cultural or legal specificities, but I think he just failed. Like he didn't have a steady job and my mom was always there to take care of him so he came back.
THERAPIST: I see. Do you think it was mostly that, somewhere to live and food?
CLIENT: I think so. (pause) Yeah. (pause) I mean, yeah, what else because if those affairs didn't work out and then he was left in the cold I suppose. He didn't have it in him to make his own life, you know, right?
THERAPIST: Did he live off these other women when he was with [other women]?
CLIENT: I'm not sure. I'm not sure of the financial thing. (pause) Like the woman he quote-unquote married, he was teaching at this computer academy and she was a student. So then he was making for those few years, he had a job until the academy tanked. (chuckles) (pause)
THERAPIST: What about your mom? What do you think was in it for her?
CLIENT: I think she loved him. She kept thinking she could change him.
THERAPIST: Into what?
CLIENT: (chuckles) Into a more responsible guy. (chuckles) Yeah, I think she probably had a very, very specific list of demands. Like one, quit smoking; two, get a job; three (chuckles) You know, control your temper. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Do you think it bothered her that he was with other women?
CLIENT: I'm sure, yeah. I'm sure it devastated her. Like she would stay up I think I was there [when I was actually] aware of something that must have been happening. Like he was at a bar or something or she said she kept calling, wanting him to come home, and I fell asleep at some point. He ","P1-N400A11":"came in the morning or something and he said "Now, you know it's very hard. I have no job" and this and that. "I have to be the designated driver, that's what I was doing." So he was trying to guilt-trip us into thinking he was up to something other than completely selfless (chuckles) and public serving.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: (chuckles) So does this ever go away, or am I going to keep talking about it?
THERAPIST: What's the "this"? Does "this"?
CLIENT: I don't know. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well, maybe we should think about what you might want to know about what "this" is.
CLIENT: Will I ever stop talking about it? Well, maybe not so much that, but me to keep getting affected by this.
THERAPIST: I have a few thoughts a few questions, actually. My first question is, can you imagine that? Can you imagine a time where your past feels like it can dominate your experience?
CLIENT: Yeah, like when I feel strong and when I'm feeling positive and when I feel like I can do stuff. I wouldn't say "do anything." (chuckles) But do stuff, like work and get be successful and help people and be sensitive and articulate and all that. Yeah, just be positive and see that in people, ","P1-N400BB1":"that I did something good, then I feel like that cloud of my past is far away, you know. Even when I'm dealing with my mom and she doesn't seem miserable or anything, you know. When I feel like I can move forward and I have [inaudible at 00:29:25] and stuff, I don't see my past dominating me.
THERAPIST: And so in asking me that, did you want affirmation about that?
CLIENT: About what?
THERAPIST: Well, you said do I think that there could be a time where this won't dominate, and so I asked you and you said "Yes, I actually do think so."
CLIENT: (chuckles)
THERAPIST: So I'm wondering, and you're asking me, did you want affirmation?
CLIENT: I guess, yeah, I like the reminder that yes, it is possible. (chuckles) Or maybe just [correct my attitude a little bit] and say "Well, there will be periods where you will feel down, and then you will find your path pulling you back." I don't know. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: So what came to mind is both, both sides. One that I would not let you be too quote-unquote too hopeful, and the other side -
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: to affirm that you can sort of overcome some of these fears.
CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I feel like those moments really highlight the ways that you can feel very alone.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Because it seems like you feel sort of out there on your own with your own thoughts and fears, and you're looking for me to ground you somehow.
CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) (pause) I guess grounded in the boundaries of human experience and like what other people have gone through (chuckles) so I don't feel so weird and alone, I guess.
THERAPIST: What came to my mind, not remembering much physics, is like when you ground an electrical charge.
CLIENT: Mmmm.
THERAPIST: That's what came to my mind. Like you don't want to be too hopeful, but not too pessimistic.
CLIENT: (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Grounded like an electrical charge.
CLIENT: Yeah, I suppose. (pause) Yeah. In a way I have this need to be grounded. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: That's interesting. (pause) I know this has come up at times throughout our work. Aside from the logistical parts, do you feel that coming an extra time, especially after Wednesday, a week for a while would be helpful to you?
CLIENT: I think it would be. It's just for me, it's the financial -
THERAPIST: Well, that's because finances are just logistical and certainly not just logistical.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But I wanted I always want to think about what's best for treatment and then figure the fees out.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But I wanted to because I know I've brought it up, and I feel like we've never fully discussed it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And so to start with, it's helpful for me to know what you think would be ideal and take it from there. So has that been something that you've thought about?
CLIENT: Well, since there are logistical problems, I haven't thought about it too much. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Maybe that's a problem in itself.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Well, if you don't let yourself think about things because you imagine it's not possible, then what are all the things you're not allowing yourself to think about?
CLIENT: What? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Yeah, that's two-pronged. One is, that might be a even if things aren't possible, there might be a lot of value in thinking about them, and you may also assume that things aren't possible that might be possible.
CLIENT: Yeah. I try not to I don't know. (chuckles) It's funny. I feel like I have you and Chris [ph] and all these other people to like curb my enthusiasm all the time. (laughter)
THERAPIST: What do you mean by that?
CLIENT: Well, this is where I feel like a child or like I don't feel like I can make my decisions and I feel alone and childish, I suppose. Like I wanted to go to Greece on my own and not with Chris [ph]. Or like go with him but do my own thing because I don't trust him to provide the right kind of ","P1-N401111":"dynamic that I'm looking for. So I found this teaching gig where you stay there and teach English for two weeks, but that just kind of looks a bit dubious.
THERAPIST: Do you think you could get trapped in therapy?
CLIENT: Hmmm. Because I hope I mean, it doesn't feel like that. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: The mornings when I'm like, oh, do I have to go? (chuckles) But other you know, I don't feel trapped.
THERAPIST: Well, let me ask you this. How do you feel coming an extra time a week would be helpful to you?
CLIENT: I don't know. Would we have enough to talk about? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: That's not how it would be helpful to you. That's how you're skeptical it would be helpful to you.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. Would it be helpful? (chuckles) (pause) I don't know. What would it be like [to watch therapy]? (chuckles) (pause)
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like I mean, this is something I'm suggesting. I have thoughts about how it might be useful.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But it sounds like it's not simply logistical. It's also you're not sure it's something that you want or you have thoughts about it.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I guess we have to do it if it was logistically possible. We can see how helpful it is. (chuckles) I cannot predict how it might be.
THERAPIST: Right. Well, there's the and that's even logistical, is it helpful. But your thoughts about it and worries or feelings about it are important too.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)
THERAPIST: On a very basic level, sort of the way I see what we're doing together is I mean, you have very ambitious and I mean that in a very good way -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: goals about what you want for yourself emotionally and in your life.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You want things to be different. You want your experience to be different. You want possibilities to be open. You want to be thinking and feeling about things differently than you have before. As you said, you know, is your past going to dominate your experience or can you change it. And ","P1-N401451":"you already have. I mean, you're already making great progress.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But there's a lot to be done. And in general, when I see people who want to do this, I do think frequency helps more than -
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: It's almost like when you learn a language. If you do an immersion program for six months, you're better off than taking it once a week for two years, you know?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So it's not only the amount of sessions, it's the intensity and I do think the intensity can help.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And that's the general idea I have. And you use this process beautifully, you really do.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And I see that you use twice a week intensively, and I do think that could even sort of be deepened with three times a week. Not to say that twice a week isn't very I think it's very helpful.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But that's my thinking along those lines when I think about frequency of treatment.
CLIENT: Okay. Yeah, I mean, sure. (chuckles) I would welcome that experience then (chuckles) if you recommend it highly. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Yeah. Then there's also the practical issues, and then there's your feelings about it and what it even means, which is part of it too. I mean, I'm definitely willing to you know, I think I mentioned I don't think it's a good idea to bill your insurance for a third session because I think ","P1-N401631":"they probably won't pay for it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I'd rather just have the benefit from what they're covering.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But obviously well, not obviously I'd offer you a very reduced fee for that third session a week.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It would be more than zero, but -
CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: it would be a very reduced fee but I also appreciate, as we've been talking about, that finances are very tight.
CLIENT: Yeah, I wish I could do something about that but -
THERAPIST: Well, that's also what we're talking about.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Sorry, what were you going to say?
CLIENT: No, I just wanted to like give my work a few more months and not get a job just yet, you know? Like I'm not in a good place right now mentally or work-wise because I haven't worked on my project for 23 days now and that feels like so horrible. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: So in your mind, being able to come a third time a week would mean sacrificing your craft somewhat.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I mean, I'll have to see, like not just about the money issue but also like the (pause) Yeah. Because it's not like I come here and I forget what we talk about.
THERAPIST: It's such a complicated calculus because people go to therapy so they can live a fuller life.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But you don't want to do so much therapy that it's impeding your living your life right now.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So it's an important calculus. I mean, the goal is hopefully not to have therapy happen all the time.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: In some ways maybe but in terms of working on things -
CLIENT: Right. These are the two things I need to work on basically, like my work and therapy. Some people would say therapy is most important but for me, working is slightly more important just because it's what got me depressed and it's also my therapy in a way, right?
THERAPIST: Well, and hopefully they're not in competition with each other.
CLIENT: Yeah, no, only when it's logistical like with money, it could be in conflict. And time-wise it could be [in conflict]. I don't think I mean, there are a bunch of other things that I'm doing which I feel like I can reduce. (chuckles) Like the stuff in the community, but then that also becomes ","P1-N4019D1":"some kind of a therapy. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well yeah, we can I mean, first of all, again, I'm willing to make the third session very reduced.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: The other thing I don't know if it's a mistake I got your insurance payment last week at some point, and they paid an extra $10 a session.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I don't know if that's an error or if they're actually paying $10 more a session, but then I could just credit that to a next session.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: You know what I'm saying?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So it would be even cheaper.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And if they are doing that, I have to adjust your co-pay too.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: But anyway, just to let you know. So it's not a huge logistical piece, but it is a little piece that could be less money.
CLIENT: Well, if they are paying more then they will definitely come back and realize their mistake at some point. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I don't know if it's a mistake or if they raised their rates. I have no idea. I can find out.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: It could be they raised their rates.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I don't know.
CLIENT: I don't know either.
THERAPIST: They usually don't give extra money away.
CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) Sometimes they do. I think I once got a check by mistake and then they said "Oh, don't cash it, don't cash it."
THERAPIST: Well, I'll look into that piece.
CLIENT: Okay. You can look into it (chuckles) and you can let me know how much it would be and (chuckles) I can see because I thought maybe I should live on my own, but even that might have to be put on hold. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Because?
CLIENT: Money. (laughter) It's all money. It's like all tied up. Like if my mom finds a job, then I'll have my own money and then I can spend it. But if she doesn't find a job, then I have to stay with them unless I would find a job of my own which I don't right now.
THERAPIST: Well, that's not true. That's true because I mean, you don't have to wait for your mom to find a job in order to live on your own. You don't have to give her money and she can worry about that herself.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You're not making that decision.
CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah.
THERAPIST: That's still your decision.
CLIENT: Yeah, it's a decision. I shouldn't see it as a have-to.
THERAPIST: Well, you feel that way.
CLIENT: Yeah. It's funny how my experience of things is very different than what is actually happening or might seem to a third person. (chuckles) (pause)
THERAPIST: Well, in that way, if we go back to the idea of being trapped -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You make her your captor.
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Well, in the sense that she you can't do anything without her doing something.
CLIENT: I guess we're in a lock. Like a deadlock. (chuckles) But trying not to like make this feel too much of a trap, although I guess it seems like that. (pause) Yeah, like it's also like a sheltered space where I could be productive, like do other things. (pause) Like a lot of other creative things, ","P1-N401F51":"they happen within enclosed spaces.
THERAPIST: Like Rushdie?
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Didn't he write a lot while he was in prison?
CLIENT: Yeah, and Proust and [inaudible at 00:47:14]. They all had to go away and put aside their [Paris] adventures and live in a very small town. In their mothers' places, I think. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: We should stop here for today. I'll see you on Wednesday.
CLIENT: Okay, have a good day.
THERAPIST: Thank you.
