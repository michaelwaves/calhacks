DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her current legal issues and how it's having a negative impact on the relationship with her boyfriend. Client discusses her current work situation and how she often gets taken advantage of by her employers.
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in.
CLIENT: Sorry I'm late.
THERAPIST: Come in. You know what? I realized, [one quick matter on] (ph) housekeeping. So next week I give out statements.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So we still haven't decided on what the fee was. I was starting to make up the statements.
CLIENT: Oh, okay.
THERAPIST: We still haven't talked about that.
CLIENT: I thought eighty five?
THERAPIST: That's fine. Normally, I think I had said that I normally when people are working That's fine. We're meeting twice a week and so I understand that's pretty costly. Eight five will be more than fine.
CLIENT: Okay. And then you'll just send the bill.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I'll e-mail it to you.
CLIENT: Oh, e-mail it to me.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And then I can just bring you in a check?
THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. I usually just ask people to pay within a couple of weeks of the statements.
CLIENT: Okay. That should work out fine.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: (sigh) I feel like I haven't seen you in so long. (laughs)
THERAPIST: We didn't see each other on Monday.
CLIENT: No. Oh which reminds me. This coming Monday I am going to be in Ohio and like I won't be back in time. So I just don't want to like take a chance of missing and not being able to be here. So I'll just come next Thursday. [00:02:00]
THERAPIST: Next Thursday? Okay.
CLIENT: Okay. (sigh) It's been kind of a long week. I'm trying to think. So we went to court last week.
THERAPIST: Mm hm. I haven't seen you since then.
CLIENT: He got arraigned on the charges and then the trial starts on March 22nd. So hopefully between now and then we can, I guess the goal is to be able to get the charges dismissed. So hopefully, but we'll see. Kevin was here all weekend and he was very detached on Friday, well Thursday night, and ","P1-N4003B1":"I thought, "Okay, well that seems pretty normal because we're going to court."
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: So I feel like how do we completely keep things separate and not really fall back into a pattern and like start over? But he keeps saying like, "Oh we can't start over until, you know, after all the legal stuff is taken care of." And I'm just like So I don't even know what is happening right now.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And I know that he, you know, falling back into a pattern of, you know, not talking and not being able to communicate correctly and fighting, is definitely not where we want to go. But at the same time it's like if you're trying to keep it separate and then you want to start over, should we ","P1-N4004D1":"be seeing each other now? But he doesn't want to break up. So I'm sort of like just going with it at the moment. (laughs) [00:05:39]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And not really sure what to do. I mean I tried talking to him and stuff, but he just keeps saying, "I don't know."
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And I guess, you know, he doesn't know. And maybe he just needs some time to sort of figure that out, I guess. And he's just trying to I think he's just trying really hard to not fall back into a pattern of what we did before. And so his way of doing that is whatever it is that he's doing ","P1-N400551":"now. (laughs) I don't know.
THERAPIST: Do you know why he wants to keep sort of the legal, you know, what's going legally, from other things in your relationship?
CLIENT: I think he feels like, I guess, what happened, he just keeps saying, "That doesn't happen in most relationships. Most people don't have this happen. Like this doesn't happen all the time. Like what kind of relationship is this? If this is happening, is it even a good relationship?" [00:07:54]
THERAPIST: Well it sounds like he's really scared about the implications of this happening in your relationship and he doesn't know what to do with it.
CLIENT: Yeah, he's really nervous about having to tell his job and how that could affect, you know, basically how it's all going to affect his career and stuff like that down the line. So I think he's really having a hard time sort of focusing on our relationship right now and like fixing it because ","P1-N4006B1":"he's too concerned about what's going to happen with his career. [00:10:14]
THERAPIST: When he says, you know, "This isn't normal. This doesn't happen in most relationships," how do you feel?
CLIENT: I understand. I know that it doesn't. And when it does it's something probably has to happen. But at the same time I've tried to say to him, "I think it happens." I know that it happens a lot more than people think. And I know that when it's happening to you it's the end of the world. [00:12:49]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: So it's sort of we have differences of opinions. But, you know, I'm not the one who is facing legal charges either. I mean, maybe if I was and, you know, the positions were flipped, I may feel the same way as he, like I can't focus on anything else. But, you know, whether or not I'm going to ","P1-N400851":"have my career that I've worked almost twenty years on and, you know, all this other stuff.
THERAPIST: Is he feeling depressed now?
CLIENT: Yeah. He said this morning he feels like he just wakes up depressed and he just kind of, you know, goes about his day and isn't really overly excited about anything. And when we were talking I said, you know, I usually ask him like how he's feeling. And he just says, you know, "Okay." And, you ","P1-N4008B1":"know, "He's like 'good' isn't really an option right now, but I'm okay I guess."
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: It very well could be. So I'm hoping that he finds a therapist or something to see down there to just to talk and sort of get whatever he's feeling off his chest. Because he's definitely holding on to a lot. [00:16:06]
THERAPIST: Mm hm. Does he want to see a therapist down there?
CLIENT: Yeah. He keeps saying he does, but then I feel like sometimes by the time he gets home from work he's too, I don't know, I guess depressed to feel like looking for someone. And I don't want to push it, but at the same time, you know, I keep asking him like, "You really need to do something. ","P1-N400951":"You really need to go see someone soon."
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: So I'm feeling a little uneasy about the situation. And then my Mom, of course she always, (sigh) it's always something else with her. Thursday night she texted me and said, I don't even know what. Something about, "I hope everything goes well tomorrow." And then Friday morning she texted me, ","P1-N4009B1":"or Saturday morning she texted me and said, "I hope everything went well yesterday." [00:17:33]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: So I feel like, yeah, she's trying to be nice but it's also sort of just a cop out because she's just texting. [00:20:53]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: You know, if she sincerely cared about wanting to change stuff then I feel like she should be calling me and making a verbal effort and not just sending a text message. It's much easier to do that rather than actually call somebody.
THERAPIST: It sounds like both with your Mom and your boyfriend there are similar frustrations. That their actions are not coordinating on concurrent with what they are saying.
CLIENT: Yeah. And so I feel like confused and just sort of I don't really know how I should be acting.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And what I should be doing. And I definitely, with my Mom at least, you know, I feel a little bit more like I know which way I want to go with her. And then I don't want to go back into having the same crazy relationship and the yelling and the drama and, you know, I've already made that decision. [00:22:01]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And it is becoming a little frustrating and, you know, I don't know. Like even when I try to talk to him, it's sort of he just says the same thing all the time about trying to keep everything separate and all that. But I don't know if I need to sort of dig a little deeper and just say like, ","P1-N400C31":""I'm not sure if this is going to work." Or, "I'm not sure if this is, you know, this sort of approach is okay for the time being." You know? [00:23:25]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: He's sort of just being depressed and sort of wallowing his own self pity. Which for a certain period of time I guess everyone's allowed to do that. But at some point he needs to kind of do something about it and make an effort on his part to sort of figure out his feelings and what he wants ","P1-N400C91":"and all that stuff.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: So it's sort of frustrating. I kind of just want him to (laughs) do something. But I don't want to be pushy. And, you know, I guess everyone has to do it on their own time. [00:24:33]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: But I just don't like being in this sort of limbo. (sigh)
THERAPIST: Well it sounds like what happened scared him. And it didn't simply scare him in terms of, you know, possible impact of his future. But as you said, he was scared that he was capable of that. That he saw something in him that scared him.
CLIENT: Yeah. He says, "I just didn't know that I had such anger and such feelings inside of me," when he thought that he had sort of gotten over them. And I think that we've had a few conversations where he sort of has looked back and said, you know, "Oh well, there were some red flags over the years ","P1-N400D91":"that, you know, I'm now seeing that maybe have indicated that I didn't quite get over everything that had happened before. And, you know, I should've done something about it." [00:25:59]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And the fact that he still feels that way is sort of, I guess, scary to him.
THERAPIST: Mm. Well what happened before? Before when?
CLIENT: So I guess it was six, maybe seven years ago, he dated a girl when he was living in Maine. And she apparently was very untrusting and very kind of controlling and didn't, you know, always felt like he was doing something and was going to hurt her emotionally. And where she would make him open ","P1-N400E31":"up his e-mail and she would read his e-mail. And she would read his text messages. [00:27:06]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Because he still sort of talks about her in a very bitter way and how she, you know, did so many things to him and all that stuff. So I kind of, you know, it seemed to me at first like he really wasn't over it. But I didn't realize that it was as bad as it was and he had so much anger. And he ","P1-N400ED1":"didn't realize it either.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: You know, so we're doing everything we can to try and make sure that it doesn't happen again. You don't normally expect that. It's not something that you can predict and say like, "This is going to happen today."
THERAPIST: Except you don't feel like he's doing everything he can.
CLIENT: I don't. I don't. I feel like he really needs to see somebody about it. And I've sort of felt that way. He has a really bad back. So when he was younger he was working for a company or something before he went in the military. And a refrigerator had fallen on his back. So he just is in constant ","P1-N400FD1":"pain all the time. [00:30:44]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And he doesn't want to take any medication for it. And he does all this stuff. But, you know, in the military, if he does go to the doctors too much and they say that he has to have spinal fusion or something like that, then he has to have a waiver. And it kind of messes with his career a little bit.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And a few months ago, and it sort of resulted in an argument where, you know, he was like, he was upset because I was being, I guess, not really mean but not necessarily supportive or whatever.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: where he's saying that he needs to do something and he doesn't want it to be this way, but he's not really doing anything right now.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: It's sort of frustrating me.
THERAPIST: Mm hm. Because he (inaudible at 00:32:53).
CLIENT: Yeah, it's just like he complains about stuff but then he doesn't do anything to like change it. So I'm just like, you know, if you want to fix something then you should probably put some effort into making some sort of change no matter what you have to do. So I kind of gave up on asking questions ","P1-N401171":"or giving, you know, about his back.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: But I was, in my opinion, I just felt like I was just asking him questions like, "Well, what can you do? Where can you go?" You know, "What are your options?" And he's like, "I just feel like you're being pushy."
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And I don't want to just ignore it, but I guess he just needs to do it on his own time or whatever he wants. I mean, I don't like being told what to do either.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: But sometimes I feel like I don't really complain all the time without doing something about it.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: So maybe that's just the way my Mom was with me. Like, "Don't complain about it." And so that's sort of how I feel about stuff.
THERAPIST: Did she say that often?
CLIENT: Yes and no. I mean she definitely wasn't like the very lovey kind of person. She was more of a tough love kind of person. So I guess that's probably a little bit where I get it from.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I sort of was just forced to get over stuff or deal with it and not have to You know, there wasn't like very big emotional conversations. It was sort of just like, "Suck it up and move on," kind of thing. [00:35:21]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: So the people I work for I usually let them I feel like probably walk all over me with, you know, watching the kids and always being home and everything. But actually yesterday they asked me to watch the kids at night and I had planned to go to a yoga class. And they always ask me like the morning ","P1-N401391":"of if they can go out that night.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: You know Wednesdays are half days at school in Wallingford (ph) so they get out of school at noon. So I have them from noon until six or seven when their parents get home.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And I finally just said, you know, like, "If you're going to go out that's fine, but I need you to tell me beforehand not the morning of."
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And that was kind of a big deal for me because I am usually just when it comes to them or a lot of people I'm just like, "Okay, okay, okay, whatever." And I'll probably complain about it or get annoyed and then just don't really say anything to them.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: So to me that was like a big deal. (laugh)
THERAPIST: [Do you feel okay?] (ph)
CLIENT: Yeah. It was like she Because I think sometimes I'm always so afraid that people are going to be mad or she's going to be upset with me. And so I don't want to say anything to really make waves. And I would just sort of let them do whatever they wanted. And saying something and her just saying, ","P1-N401511":""Oh, no I understand. That's totally fine," was kind of a relief for me. [00:37:58]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: Because I didn't expect it. I sort of expected her to be annoyed. But she wasn't and she totally understood. And I think she does understand that I have a lot on my plate right now. So if they could be a little bit less, I don't know, less pushy. Or not really pushy, but if they could be a little ","P1-N401551":"bit more, you know, I don't know what the word would be. I'm blanking on it. But considering my time, I guess, instead of always just considering theirs.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And you know, because they will come home from work whenever they want to. And they only have an hour or two with the kids. And then sometimes they go out. And sometimes one has a meeting and they leave anyway.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: Plus I also feel like at this point I've pretty much just lived to always be there. I'm always at the house, always do stuff with kids. And, you know, I wasn't there on the weekends a lot when Kevin was living in Maine because it was only a three hour drive so I could leave. But now that he ","P1-N4015F1":"is living so far away I can't fly there every weekend.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And, you know, when I was there on the weekends I was always doing stuff with them and always being with them. And I'm like, "I can't be here all the time because it's making me nuts." You know?
THERAPIST: What is your agreement with them in terms of how much you work?
CLIENT: Technically I only work after school Monday through Friday. Like I pick the kids up from school Monday through Friday and then if one of them has to She always leaves for work at 7:20 but he usually takes the kids to school. But if he has to go in early or something then I'll take the kids ","P1-N401671":"to school. [00:39:54]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: Like I don't have to eat dinner with them. And I don't have to sit down and have breakfast with them. And I don't have to go everywhere and sort of can do my own thing. And, hopefully, as that happens over the next six months it will make me a little less stressed out and just feeling trapped.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And, you know, a normal job I would have my weekends free. And there was a lot of times that, even when I was in Maine, they sort of didn't really respect the fact that I was away. And they would, you know, they wouldn't call so much but, you know, they'd send me e-mails.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And I was up in Maine. And they were like, you know, the kids don't have school but they e-mailed me at eight o'clock in the morning and said, "Can you be home by noon?" And it's a three and a half hour drive for me. So I finally called and I was like, "No. I can't be home by noon because it's, ","P1-N4017D1":"you know, eight o'clock in the morning and you're asking me to be home in like three hours." Or, you know, "No. I'm away."
THERAPIST: Mm hm. Because that feels familiar.
CLIENT: Yeah. Like my Mom's always done that. (laughs) She never really gives me a break. And I just wanted to kind of have some time to myself.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And they kind are always just taking advantage of stuff. And it gets very frustrating. And they don't, I think unless I say something to them like I did yesterday about not asking me the day of about watching the kids, that they probably won't ever really change. [00:43:18]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: So that sort of adds to some of my stress. Being there all the time and not being able to sort of get out.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: But hopefully I'll be able to be a little bit more assertive (laughs) about my own time on the weekends if I'm going to be there.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And that should help. (pause)
THERAPIST: Hm. Because it takes I mean certainly they should be more thoughtful of you, they definitely should. But it takes two to be taken advantage of. It's both people who are either intending to or just not thinking about another person. And then you are not setting the boundaries. [00:44:22]
CLIENT: Right. And I sort of as I was thinking like, you know, I let them because I don't say, "No." And I don't want to upset them by saying, "No," or, you know, anything like that. So they're not intentionally trying to take advantage of me but they are.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And so it does, you know, it works both ways. You know, I've sort of allowed them to do it.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And they just continue to do it whether they're noticing or not.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: So even though this is my last sort of six months there, I feel like I'm going to have to really start putting my foot down over the next six months or I'm going to go crazy (laughs) being there all the time.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: It's just a lot never having a break. Especially with the kids because they don't really have There's no boundaries in when their parents come home that they can sort of leave me alone. They don't kind of thing. It's just they constantly ask all of us for stuff. And, you know. [00:45:32]
THERAPIST: There's no separation.
CLIENT: I've become Yeah, there's not really any separation. I've sort of become less like the nanny and more just a part of the family.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: So, you know, when we go places she doesn't even like to introduce me as the nanny. She's like, "I just always feel so bad introducing you like that because I feel like you're more like family." I'm like, "Okay. That's fine and that's great." But, you know, then it comes to things like having ","P1-N401B11":"boundaries and separation of giving me my own personal space.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: When I need it. Especially when I'm there all the time.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: So, oh boy.
THERAPIST: Well, we're going to have to stop for today.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Can I just ask you. I don't if I'll need this, and if you can't do it that's fine, but I'm wondering if we would be able to start ten minutes earlier on Thursdays. Is that a possibility?
CLIENT: Yeah. That's fine.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: At ten after one?
THERAPIST: It would be ten I'm not entirely I'm teaching until the end of the month and my schedule is shifting a little bit.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So I'm not even sure that would work. But would it be okay?
CLIENT: Yeah. If we need to that's fine.
THERAPIST: Okay. Okay.
CLIENT: Yup. Absolutely.
THERAPIST: I very much respect times and don't like to move them.
CLIENT: Oh no, no, no. I usually would be here on time. But today I got a late start. But, yeah, that's fine.
THERAPIST: Okay. So I'll let you know. Let's do 1:20 unless I contact you.
CLIENT: Okay. Great.
THERAPIST: Okay. Very good.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Have a good trip.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Okay. Take care.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:46:54)
THERAPIST: Yes. Yes. Thank you. Press the button it makes a noise.
CLIENT: Oh. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Take care.
