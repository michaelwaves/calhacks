DESCRIPTION: Client discusses how she sees her boyfriend as more of a father figure and is not sexually attracted to him. Client sometimes wants to move out on her own, but focuses on the difficulties involved in doing so.
THERAPIST: Come on in. Before I forget, would you, just for next Monday, would you be able to come at 9:15 rather than 10:15?
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: Just for next month. That would be great.
CLIENT: OK. Fifteenth today? [00:00:59]
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: So I had an interesting weekend. 9:15 then? (pause) So this weekend I was by myself at home (chuckling) (inaudible) conference, so I tried to imagine what it's like to, you know, live by yourself and create your own structure and all that (chuckling). So it seemed OK for the most part. I was ","P1-N400151":"productive, and I did lapse into kind of feeling lonely and sad (chuckling), and I felt free and all this and judgment and (chuckling) and (pause). [00:03:11]
THERAPIST: (sneezes) Excuse me.
CLIENT: Bless you. But I don't like. I feel like, I feel really bad saying this, but I feel like it could be better with other people. I feel very shy and ashamed saying it, but I feel like, you know, like, yeah. I don't feel like I should are allowed to have these talks or desires, you know? [00:09:32]
THERAPIST: Wretched?
CLIENT: Yeah. You know like we were talking about last time, my dad's (inaudible), so I think, I mean obviously I did internalize them and they're still swirling around somewhere (chuckle), so unless I purge them, expunge them, they'll be there, so ...
THERAPIST: Is that what it feels like?
CLIENT: Well, not really. Not, I shouldn't say that. I mean, for him to be a sugar daddy he'd have to be a lot older.
THERAPIST: He'd have to be a daddy?
CLIENT: A grandfather, (chuckle) or not that's my senior professor, like several years ago. So I feel like a child and an adult at the same time because a child because I don't have to take care of myself, like my bills are taken care of. It feels very nice. [00:13:57]
THERAPIST: That is interesting that you feel more comfortable taking care of your mother than yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) Yeah. I mean, I could actually go back and live in Arlington. One of the homes will become available, I just I'm not, but I'm learning I should be in the square if I do find a place. It might be more expensive, but I just want to see how it feels like to live all myself (chuckle). ","P1-N400451":"I've never done that. Like never. Is it really very different, or ... [00:16:43]
THERAPIST: Different from what?
CLIENT: (inaudible) and parents (chuckle). Well (pause) I mean, like and (inaudible) said, "Oh, it would be easy for (inaudible). I just don't like that he said that.
THERAPIST: What, (inaudible) in?
CLIENT: Well, living by yourself. I didn't like to hear that. It made me feel bad about myself.
THERAPIST: Did he mean it like as a jab or was he just making a comment?
CLIENT: He doesn't really think things through too much, like things like this. And then I said something like, "come a little more dramatic," or something. And then he said, "Oh, sorry, sorry, I shouldn't have said that. I know you're struggling with this." So ... [00:17:59]
THERAPIST: But if you imagine it came from a place of hurt that he said that.
CLIENT: Yeah, well that's to be understood.
THERAPIST: (inaudible) he knows you're thinking about breaking up with him?
CLIENT: Oh yeah, like we've had all these conversations that are like the like breaking up, so I don't know. Like it's weird. Like we do have sex, but it's, I mean it's weird. So he's telling me, "Yeah, I had a fantasy about you on Saturday," or something, and I did too, but it was not about him. I ","P1-N400591":"mean, and this I have no control over. Like a dream, I mean. I have no control over them, obviously, and they're never about him, so this was like other guys. It's weird, because you know, I may or may not have seen them that like at all, so, and where do these come from? Where do these dreams come from? [00:19:10]
THERAPIST: You're not sexually into Chris (sp).
CLIENT: Yeah. Do you think that might change, or no?
THERAPIST: What do you think?
CLIENT: I don't know. Is it possible to see someone in a different light? Someone you've known for so many years?
THERAPIST: Well anything's possible. The question for you is do you feel it's probable?
CLIENT: Well of course it's possible, like with (inaudible) I never saw him in that light until he seduced me, you know? (chuckle) And now that's the thing that's difficult is to see him in a non-sexual light, you know, that's what hurts, you know? (chuckle) [00:20:29]
THERAPIST: What does it feel like to have sex with him?
CLIENT: Weird. (chuckle) It's (inaudible). And I have to make him leave the room, so ...
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: So I can finish up, so.
THERAPIST: He leaves the you have him leave the room?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: Because I feel embarrassed, you know, like letting myself go and you have to think about someone else or something else to have, you know, I can't do it with him watching me. [00:22:23]
THERAPIST: What does what does innocent mean?
CLIENT: The way he mostly does it anyways, like, you know, like kiss me on the forehead, like take care of me and worry about me and, yeah. (pause)
THERAPIST: Chris?
CLIENT: Yeah, and the author.
THERAPIST: Oh, I see.
CLIENT: Where I can hover in the background and cook and then just hear them talk. But for me to make it as an artist, I feel like I have to speak. You know, I have to I can't just hover in the background and listen. I have to go inside myself and you know, come up with a narrative, and a story, you ","P1-N4008F1":"know? Because I'm starting to see that, I've been seeing it for a few years, that people do, are interested in hearing my voice. [00:27:37]
THERAPIST: How do you feel when you say that?
CLIENT: What?
THERAPIST: About people supporting you and encouraging you, and valuing you?
CLIENT: Well, I feel (inaudible) and scared (chuckle). I feel scared that I shouldn't let them down, I should use these opportunities very carefully, very wisely. It's like, you know, water in India or Istanbul, that you only get it for like an hour in the morning and make sure you have to fill all ","P1-N4009B1":"the pots and buckets so you can have it for the rest of the day. I want to use the environment properly, so ... [00:30:49]
THERAPIST: How?
CLIENT: Well, like practically, it would be great, it would be ideal if I can live with Chris for another year, not worry about rent, and if I do still get assistantship I can just give that money to my mom (ph). I mean, it would be easier than kind of making that I'll get a job, that will be I'll ","P1-N400A11":"like help or get a job, then there will be that guilt of making her work, so instead of dealing with those two things, I could just keep paying her rent and it's like, you know, kind of something that's out of mind, out of sight. [00:32:01]
THERAPIST: And (inaudible), you could also see it as, I'm not saying this is going to be the case, but tapping into that energy and having movement in your life can also impact (inaudible).
CLIENT: That's the unknown (chuckle).
THERAPIST: It is unknown.
CLIENT: So it is a big risk.
THERAPIST: It is. Excuse me, but I was pointing out that it's not inevitable that it's clearly good for your craft to stay where you are.
CLIENT: Well I mean, like I said last year, (inaudible) felt very empowered (chuckle). (inaudible) I felt energized, and I felt like I could do anything. Even though there are little things, that I suppose, sex makes you feel. Or good sex, I should say. But, you know, it ended so badly, right? That ","P1-N400AF1":"I couldn't work for seven months after that. [00:33:15]
THERAPIST: What do you think?
CLIENT: I don't know. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only freak. (chuckle)
THERAPIST: You felt you were a problem (inaudible)?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You don't feel it's Chris's (ph) problem too?
CLIENT: He isn't acting like it's his problem (chuckle). I know it's been awhile since you've seen him, but he does not look like he has any personal problems. He looks very together and busy and onward with ...
THERAPIST: You just described him as very restricted and inhibited.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That's a kind of problem too. He doesn't find a problem with it, that it doesn't seem like he's unhappy about it.
CLIENT: No, he's not. [00:36:55]
THERAPIST: You don't feel that your leaving him is going to have an impact on him?
CLIENT: I'm sure it might in some moments, but mostly that's how he will deal with it. He'll just work more if it's possible to work more (chuckle). I'm not saying that he won't be affected. I'm not that bitter or naive, but I will actually (inaudible). Not to deal with it just because not having to ","P1-N400D11":"deal with that guilt, that, I'm not very good with dealing with guilt. You can get me to do anything by making me feel guilty (chuckle). [00:39:45]
THERAPIST: Well A, that comes from a need to devalue your sexual desires, and B, as you say, that's not the only thing that you're not happy about in your relationship.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I guess it seems I just have to find the right place, you know, not just balance, but actual place, physical and mental, where I can take these people like Chris (ph) and this woman who I hold up so much and who have encouraged me, and to take their instruction and use it as kind ","P1-N400D71":"of a support mechanism. But then is just like secondary. The primary thing is I'm the only person shaping my material. Yeah. [00:42:02]
THERAPIST: You worry about being too expensive?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It's almost like you described the room that you were in before the home you were in? It was too much (inaudible).
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:45:15]
THERAPIST: Do you think if you're too expensive you'll eventually burst?
CLIENT: Yes. Yeah, there needs to be grounding (inaudible). But maybe I have grown since then and I can have things in balance.
THERAPIST: I think you have grown since then.
CLIENT: It's only been a few months, so who knows? (chuckle)
THERAPIST: You're working hard to grow.
CLIENT: I'm trying. Because not I feel like not no one is just themselves purely. You know, we're all like a construction of different pieces and particles, like I'm not just me purely, like there's there's bits of my mom and me, and sadly, I know that there's bits of my dad in me, and there's ","P1-N400F11":"Chris (ph) and me, and there's Victor (ph) and me, and there's, you know artists are alike, so instead of when I shut the door, I shouldn't see, just me, me, me. I should see all the disparate parts that are in me and that are not, in me, but have influenced me, and are, or have at some point shared ","P1-N400F12":"my life. So maybe looking at it that way I'll feel less afraid, and I'll feel less looney.
THERAPIST: You'll have more fortitude.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I do need to stop for today. I will see you in a month (inaudible).
CLIENT: Have a good day.
THERAPIST: You, too. [00:47:24]
