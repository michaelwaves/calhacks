DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the narrative of her life that she clings to, uses for her own opinion of herself, but is embarrassed by. Client discusses how she tries to protect her mother's narrative.
THERAPIST: Hi! Come on in! [00:01:16]
CLIENT: (pause) (chuckles) (pause) And so I apologized to like, the women in my group that I, you know, from Sunday. (therapist responds) I barged out on them (chuckles), and I heard back from everyone I, you know, (inaudible) a call. So like, I’m... (sighs) feeling very grateful (chuckles) that ","P1-N4000D1":"they’re, I don’t know, you know, just anybody didn’t take it as personally. And I feel lucky that, you know, that they didn’t kick me to the curb (chuckles), like some people.
THERAPIST: How you feel about her and yourself will change the dynamic.
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: How you feel about yourself and how you feel about her would change the dynamic.
CLIENT: Yeah. Hmm. So it’s not anything external? [00:16:17]
THERAPIST: No. I don’t think she’s going to change much. She is who she is, she’s pretty predictable.
CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah.
THERAPIST: But... I’m sorry, go ahead.
CLIENT: No like, I meant like, you know like, change in our financial situation might. It’ll make me feel differently, maybe.
THERAPIST: Change in what way?
CLIENT: Maybe when she finds, if she finds a job or, you know like, once my program is done, you know, something happens for me or like, you know, find a job or (chuckles) something.
THERAPIST: I think that that’s actually an extension of your current dynamic, which is that what controls your relationship is your fate, whether things turn out good in life or bad in life, that your fate or lack, or your luck or lack thereof is what shapes your relationship. But I think that ","P1-N4003D1":"that’s the dynamic.
CLIENT: (responds) (pause) Yeah, I’m trying to feel differently about myself. [00:17:26]
THERAPIST: It wasn’t a criticism.
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: I said it wasn’t a criticism.
CLIENT: Yeah, no, I am just trying to understand like, because I mean, you’ve said this very pointedly, so I wonder like, am I making progress in these areas? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I think you are. I mean, you see... and how you see yourself and how you see your mother are so intertwined, right? (client responds) But, you know, to the extent that you see your mom as sort of a, you know, kind of pathetic person with, you know, kind of a low status in life, who has no ","P1-N400491":"options, very much shapes the way you see her and how you relate. The two, how two people relate to each other, and also in very practical senses, versus a woman who does, who had extremely bad luck early in life and had a lot of constraints put on her, but that now has options and makes some choices ","P1-N400492":"and not others. [00:18:23]
CLIENT: Hmm. (blows nose) I need that (ph).
THERAPIST: You tend to see her as controlled entirely by her fate, you know. Your mother is the type of person who must work in a grocery store; that is her fate. We are a lowly people, with a lowly status. (client chuckles) Versus like, substitute teaching is hard. I’d rather work in a grocery ","P1-N4004D1":"store. It’s easy!
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I see that sometimes. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I know you do.
CLIENT: On sunny days (chuckles).
THERAPIST: I know you do.
CLIENT: But I guess myself, do I see myself also as like, a victim of fate or...?
THERAPIST: Sometimes, yeah.
CLIENT: Oh.
THERAPIST: Like in the summer, with that creepy guy. (client responds) You were of a low status, and you need to sort of grovel for people of a higher status’ goodwill. [00:19:34]
CLIENT: Yeah. But that was his narrative he was pushing on me, right?
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: His narrative is irrelevant.
CLIENT: (inaudible) (chuckles) [00:19:53]
THERAPIST: That’s your narrative.
CLIENT: No!
THERAPIST: That’s your narrative. Your friend, who has all this wonderful family ties, and comes from a good family, and you come from no family... It’s your narrative.
CLIENT: Okay, so like, really? (chuckles) Am I like fighting it? I know it’s real, that it has been, and I can think that way. But then like, help me like, tell me like, how do I like, negotiate all these differences, like objective differences that are actually really there? Yeah.
THERAPIST: What, how do you mean, objective differences?
CLIENT: So like, I am, I love to go to Nepal, I want to go to Nepal. (therapist responds) When I get there, you know, it’s up to me to kind of make things happen like, in terms of where to live, you know. Like, I could be way more enterprising than I’ve been in the past, and I haven’t ","P1-N400731":"because, you know, it’s, I usually end up staying at, staying with Chris (sp). (therapist responds) Now that that, I want, if I want to change that, I have to make things happen like, call my husband’s (ph) and (inaudible) family, “Come and stay with us.” [00:21:15]
THERAPIST: Maybe next time, you should go with your gut.
CLIENT: Yeah. So I’m just saying like, how much of it wasn’t my narrative slash (ph), how much of it was objective reality.
THERAPIST: But it’s not objective. It’s her narrative. And everyone, I mean you could find someone with a narrative for anything. When you take it on, that’s what’s important. I mean, I do appreciate that there is a cultural piece. I certainly don’t want to dismiss that. ","P1-N4007F1":"(client affirms) But, I mean, people have all sorts of narratives that (client affirms) you can buy into or think, “This is crazy!” (client affirms) So then she had it, that she had it doesn’t... I understand you’re not making it up, but that she had it. You understand that she ","P1-N4007F2":"has it for her own particular psychology and her own particular problems doesn’t, to me, seem therefore prove it’s an objective narrative. It’s her narrative, based on her own problems. [00:24:12]
CLIENT: No, I just, I guess objective, I meant like, the differences that, you know, me not having a place to stay and, you know, her having a place. (chuckles) That’s what I mean.
THERAPIST: I don’t have a place to stay in Nepal. (client laughs) People whose families come, you know, where almost the whole family comes over, they may not have a place to stay. (client affirms) It’s a practical issue. You’re making it into this sort of symbolic meaning of status ","P1-N400831":"and, you know, but it’s a practical issue at heart. (client affirms) If you come from a wildly affluent family, and they all come to the States or Europe or whatever, you may not have anywhere to stay!
CLIENT: I think of it as completely symbolic. I just can’t not!
THERAPIST: Well, right! That’s the point! You take it as completely symbolic. You do not see it as practical. And I imagine, you know, I guess if you come from this wildly wealthy family, you’ve got some fourth cousin who might want you to stay with them, that you didn’t know, but...
CLIENT: Yeah... Maybe it’s like that whole like, thing about Nepal. Like, I would feel, if I go to someplace else, I would totally feel neutral. But you know, that’s where, it’s like a big giant sore spot, still. Like, that whole story and that narrative of, “I came from here ","P1-N400891":"and I was kicked out of here” or like you know, “I had to move from here.” [00:25:44]
THERAPIST: How were you kicked out?
CLIENT: Oh, not kicked out; more like, dragged over from, by my dad (chuckles). (therapist responds) So... Like, yeah. Just... I’d like for that narrative to change, obviously, to feel more neutral about Nepal and (chuckles), I mean, at least, you know, the very practical drama of like, going ","P1-N4008D1":"back there, going there for summers and stuff (chuckles). (sighs)
THERAPIST: When you say kicked out, it’s almost like you were lower status citizens that weren’t allowed to stay. (client affirms) (pause) The country didn’t reject you. [00:26:42]
CLIENT: I think in those terms, surprise, surprise! (chuckles) Both Nepal and the U.S., I guess.
THERAPIST: But that has nothing to do with objective reality.
CLIENT: Yeah. I should remember that.
THERAPIST: People from all over the world, their parents decide to leave, come to the States, wherever, but the State, for various reasons; the country wasn’t kicking them out. Actually, some people, that’s true; the country does kick them out, but that wasn’t in your case.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) No, they didn’t. (chuckles) And neither has the U.S. kicked me out in any way. (chuckles) I’ve made friends in both places, and people have welcomed me in both places, and I’ve had bad experiences in both places, so... [00:27:48]
THERAPIST: And its universities have given you funding so they, because they want you to study at them.
CLIENT: Yeah! I can never forget that. I mean, that’s, it’s like a big welcome hug, you know? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: It is. It absolutely is.
CLIENT: A big embrace! Yeah. I mean, I definitely see that, so... I feel that way. I feel appreciated here (chuckles), more than in Nepal, actually (laughs). But then, it scares me, you know. I’m trying to be less scared about it. I should be like... earlier it would really freak me out, like ","P1-N400A11":"people’s acceptance of me and their love. I guess, I would like, “What would I do with this? I’m totally going to let them down!” Like, with Chris’s parents like, being nice to me. I just totally feel awful, thinking about it. (chuckles) I mean our, it’s so awkward ","P1-N400A12":"right now, but like, you know like, not being whatever, faithful to him, or not wanting to be with him in that way makes me feel... (chuckles) I should, obviously (inaudible). [00:29:24]
THERAPIST: Does your mom go to a fancy gym? (client affirms) Where does she go?
CLIENT: (laughing) I’m not going to tell you. You’re going to judge her! (laughs)
THERAPIST: How... How would I judge her?
CLIENT: Well, you know, well, I’m just saying. Yeah, she goes to a nice gym, and that’s like her one nice thing she does for herself, because everyone knows her and like everyone is her age there. So...
THERAPIST: Well, how would I judge her? I’m not sure I understand.
CLIENT: (chuckles) I was kidding. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well, you had something in mind. [00:34:39]
CLIENT: No, you’d say or like, “And she expects you to pay for, pay her rent,” and all that. I didn’t pay her rent this month, actually. So... But (sighs), I don’t know. So anyway, so yeah. Yeah, so I’m building this narrative. Um, and like, with this new guy that ","P1-N400BF1":"“Yeah, you know, she’s a princess, she’s spoiled, she goes to a fancy gym, and you know, she...” What else? “She’s getting a Masters and like, she has particular tastes about this and that.”
THERAPIST: Well, her being spoiled is a very different kind of narrative.
CLIENT: Exactly! It’s the opposite of a victim. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well, why that narrative?
CLIENT: I am so desperately wanting something new like, a new dynamic, a new way of seeing her than the yucky way that I was seeing her.
THERAPIST: And why would I, well, why would I judge her, or what would the point of me judging her be? I don’t understand.
CLIENT: Oh. (pause) I don’t know. I guess... you would take away that narrative that I’m building, that she’s spoiled and... (pause) What? (chuckles) [00:37:00]
THERAPIST: That that... Well, you said the fancy, you wouldn’t tell me what the fancy gym was. (client affirms) So, it wasn’t about the narrative being spoiled. You didn’t like something else.
CLIENT: Oh. I don’t know. Hmm. It happened too quickly (chuckles)! I can’t remember now.
THERAPIST: You got very protective like, “Oh, I don’t want to tell you what gym she’s a member of.”
CLIENT: Oh! No, I mean, it’s not, I don’t have, I’m not hiding it. (chuckles) You want to know the name?
THERAPIST: No, no, no! But I don’t know; there was something to that.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I guess I am protective of her, yeah. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well, what are you protecting in this instance?
CLIENT: Uh... I thought I was protecting my new narrative. But...
THERAPIST: Well, if you were protecting your new narrative, you’d be showing off where she goes.
CLIENT: Hmm. I don’t know.
THERAPIST: “Look how spoiled she is! She goes, you know, to the Ritz Carlton!” [00:38:00]
CLIENT: Yeah (chuckles) The Ritz! (ph) (chuckles) No, not that fancy! It’s not that fancy. It’s fancy, just because I don’t go to a gym and she does; that’s all. (chuckles) (pause) Yeah, I don’t know what I was protecting, just was really protecting her. Maybe that actually, ","P1-N400E51":"it’s that victim’s narrative that’s kicking in, that’s actually at the base of it, where I feel like she is a victim and she would once again be a victimized if you judge her. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: But why would I be judging her for going to a fancy gym?
CLIENT: I guess because, you know, she doesn’t have money for rent, but she’s going to a gym?
THERAPIST: How do you feel about that? [00:38:53]
CLIENT: I like, would feel, you know, it’s like conflicted. I’d want (sighs) on one level, I feel (yawns and excuses) I feel happy, like you know, she’s spoiled and you know like, I feel funny about it. But then, at another level like, “What? So irresponsible!” (chuckles) ","P1-N400ED1":"But I think I’m mostly okay with it. I’m happy that she’s doing something that she likes, even though it might be foolish like, unpractical at an economic level. (pause) I guess at the heart of it, I am very just like, protective of her and like, I feel like she is a child and needs ","P1-N400ED2":"my protection (chuckles). (therapist responds) Yeah.
THERAPIST: But I feel that what you’re trying to protect her from most is your own feelings about her.
CLIENT: Probably, yeah. (pause) My own feelings? (therapist affirms) Like what are they, in this instance? [00:40:16]
THERAPIST: You’re unhappy about her choices. (client affirms) I mean, you’ve, on the one hand, you felt like, “It is good that she does something good for herself.” On the other hand, she’s asking you for financial help and doing something that’s, that you couldn’t ","P1-N400F31":"afford to do.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it is, you know, it does conflict, it’s a conflict, but I want the generous side of me to, you know, to take over. (therapist responds) (pause) I want to have a generous side. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I think the side of your mother that you have a lot of strong feelings about, and anger, is the way she can be entitled to things.
CLIENT: Hmm. Like what things?
THERAPIST: Like, your money for rent. And I think like, the gym goes along with that. (client responds) That you want her to have good things on the one hand, and that’s the part of you that wants, that feels it’s generous. But on the other hand, you’re angry that she feels entitled ","P1-N400FD1":"to things, and sometimes at your expense, quite literally.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, that’s what I hate about other people, how they feel entitled. (chuckles) (therapist responds) But I am trying to be generous. (chuckles) Shouldn’t I feel entitled?
THERAPIST: To other people’s money? [00:42:29]
CLIENT: No. (chuckles) Not to other people’s money.
THERAPIST: Because it depends on what you feel entitled to do.
CLIENT: I don’t think we have any more time, right? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: (chuckles) Are you wanting to stop?
CLIENT: No, I’m just like, that that’s going to bring up a whole new chapter. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well, we’re going to need to stop in like, a couple of minutes, but why don’t you start and we can then pick it up on Monday, unless you really don’t want to.
CLIENT: Yeah, no, it’s this thing about money is a giant thing with me. (therapist responds) I feel... I do it, but it’s not like it goes unnoticed. Every single time Chris pays for something, I feel bad. I feel bad making this new guy buy me stuff and... making him buy me stuff and him ","P1-N4010F1":"volunteering to buy me stuff. Every single time he pays for like, a meal or something, I just feel bad, and despite the fact that, you know, I do things for both of them, different things, you know. So... (chuckles) (aside: “My knee is so big. (sighs) Drops on the floor...” end of aside) [00:43:44]
THERAPIST: Right. Because it’s about resources, of lack thereof. It’s about owing, indebtedness (client affirms), entitlement. It’s wrapped up in a lot of different, very deep psychologic meaning.
CLIENT: It’s like power, dynamics, too.
THERAPIST: (affirms) And you definitely see this new guy (who has no name, by the way), you see this new guy (client chuckles) as very powerful in that way.
CLIENT: Yeah, I try not to. I’m really trying not to.
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: Because then I won’t be able to see him at all, and I don’t want that. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: You don’t want to be with someone who’s powerful?
CLIENT: I do. I think that’s what attracts me to him. But I want power, too.
THERAPIST: (pause) So you don’t feel powerful by association to him? You feel competitive?
CLIENT: I try not to think about it, but with Chris, yeah, I feel, I have felt power by association, and then hated that. Then I just felt competitive.
THERAPIST: We do need to stop for today. I will see you on Monday.
CLIENT: Yes. See you Monday. Have a good weekend!
THERAPIST: Thank you!
CLIENT: (pause) All this stuff!
THERAPIST: Bye-bye!
