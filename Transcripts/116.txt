DESCRIPTION: Client talks about coming home from a trip to her home being violated by contractors for her neighbors' home construction. She has a sense of violation.
THERAPIST: Hi. I’ll be with you in just another minute. Hi, come on in. Hi. [00:02:32]
CLIENT: Hi. So, I was obviously away for the first few days of Passover. We went to Cleveland, which was very nice. I haven’t yeah, so I haven’t been there in a whole year and the last time I was there was actually for a conference, it wasn’t… So it was just a few days and ","P1-N4000D1":"I didn’t get to see as much of people. Of course, this time, since it was for a holiday, I also didn’t get to see everybody I really wanted to, but we were able to we were able to spend about a week there, which was very nice. We spent a lot of time working still, we’re grad students, ","P1-N4000D2":"but it was a longer time. Genevieve really enjoyed it too, which was nice. She had a lot of space to move around and she was happy, so. Just, it was very nice. [00:03:54]
THERAPIST: Intruded upon. [00:10:52]
CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. It’s completely intrusive, it was totally unacceptable and I was looking around and Karl was saying oh, we should have locked our bedroom door, and I’m thinking, why would we have to lock our bedroom door normally, when we leave? Why would we even think about that? ","P1-N400191":"(pause) What I’m wondering, thinking back, is whether this is the sort of situation where we really ought to have said, no you’re just not going to be able to do anything involving our apartment until we’re back, or is it a situation where obviously, it’s hindsight, or is it ","P1-N400192":"a situation where it’s just while we were hoping that it would mean that it was… What we were hoping at the time was that it would mean that whatever small mess, it will just be over and done with by the time we came back and I was thinking of Genevieve, that she does not like that sort ","P1-N400193":"of noise any more than I do. It would be just better to have it going on when we’re gone, over with and done. I know the next time I would be more careful, but we certainly thought we were informed about what was going on. It’s done and we’ve definitely made ourselves very clear about ","P1-N400194":"what’s appropriate with this sort of thing. I haven’t heard back from the contractor about what he’s going to be doing, but we… (pause) [00:13:44]
THERAPIST: And people taking liberties with your time and your space.
CLIENT: Right. (pause) And of course, that tends to hit me right in the right in the, um… (pause) Like I’ve just been looking around with sort of feeling half crazed today and yesterday, shrieking things like, “They’re touching my stuff!” (gasps)
THERAPIST: Meaning present tense? [00:18:37]
CLIENT: Yeah, the workers. (pause) They aren’t out just yet. Karl walked over with them here, so that we could actually talk about what was going on, and we were deciding that we just are going to have to be out today because we’re going into Shabbat. The men just have to coordinate a time ","P1-N400251":"with us for when they’re going to fix things up and figure out how to fix things up. So it’s again, we aren’t really sure that the state of the bedroom, that’s not something we’ve obviously thought about before, so. (pause) [00:19:58]
THERAPIST: And the sense of feeling violated. [00:28:17]
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)
THERAPIST: Which is how you came to therapy, with the story about neighbors who were looking in on you.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And watching you.
CLIENT: I’ve been thinking about that these past two days. I remember how one of the things that I said then was how even, when I was undressing in my bedroom, I felt like I was, you know, just totally out of sight, but I felt an embarrassment that somebody might be looking at me. Then in the ","P1-N400391":"bathroom, I felt sort of insecure, I think, and I don’t remember exactly what I said, but I remember feeling that (pause) and in a way it sort of feels like an extension of that. (pause) That I have the you know, when you realize that had you not realized that, that my house is not your house ","P1-N400392":"basically, that this is that if you want to do something in here you ask first. You don’t perceive beyond what we’ve discussed. [00:31:01]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:36:49]
CLIENT: There’s nothing you can do about that. What makes I tend to have a feeling, the sort of thinks that’s sort of shouldn’t they know better? And… (pause) That’s where the I think that’s where it’s people, human beings, that I… (pause) [00:37:57]
THERAPIST: Is that what it feels like with Kathleen?
CLIENT: A personal attack?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (pause)
CLIENT: Sometimes. Not always but sometimes it does feel like sometimes it feels so difficult to communicate when it feels impersonal, like there isn’t anybody there. But sometimes it does feel certainly, when she when she was speaking to my mother, it definitely felt that way. At one point ","P1-N4004B1":"she asked Karl about my mental health and she asked him whether I have any whether I get depressed. That definitely. That certainly was such a personal question that it felt, that certain question, invasive question, that it felt very personal, very judgmental. No, it wasn’t, I don’t know ","P1-N4004B2":"it was I asked Karl whether he thought that it was out of personal concern or whether it was or whether he knew what her feels about mental health were. He said he didn’t know. But I certainly felt extremely, very much like it was a personal judgment or an attack of some kind. [00:42:29]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. We’re going to need to leave it at that for today.
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: So, I will see you next Thursday. We have, right, we switched.
CLIENT: Did we move them again?
THERAPIST: Yeah, I think so, let me double check. I just want to make sure, because we switched next Tuesday. Okay, that’s the 24th. Yeah, I have you at 11:00 a.m. I look forward to seeing you then, take care. Have a good last few days of Passover. [00:47:51]
CLIENT: Yes, thank you.
