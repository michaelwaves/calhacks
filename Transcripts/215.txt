TITLE: Client "S" Therapy Session Audio Recording, February 26, 2014: Client discusses her issues with marriage and engagement, and why she has yet to make the leap in her relationships.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her issues with marriage and engagement, and why she has yet to make the leap in her relationships.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in. [00:00:42]
CLIENT: What should we talk about? (chuckling) [00:02:46]
THERAPIST: Who’s saying you’re in a destructive mode?
CLIENT: I guess a year ago, or maybe a year and a half ago, I guess. When that whole Victor episode happened, a friend of mine was saying, “you’re like in a destructive mode,” so...
THERAPIST: (pause) Where did you go? [00:13:08]
CLIENT: I was talking myself out of dropping out (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Ending something or leaving something is not inherently destructive. It could be, but...
CLIENT: What do you mean, inherently destructive?
THERAPIST: Well, I feel like sometimes you give examples of something destructive when you want to end it, you know, like leaving Chris. There’s nothing inherently destructive about ending something, and you’re talking about school, too. It might be, but it’s not inherently that way. [00:14:58]
CLIENT: Yeah (pause). No, I just kind of got frustrated, like why the hell am I paying all the money? I mean, I don’t have to pay much, but, you know, I understood it as like, I don’t have to pay a single dime. It’s turning out that last semester I paid 800, and this semester, it’s ","P1-N4002D1":"like I don’t even know how much. But it’s fucking late fees, and it’s not my fault. It’s all the reading (ph), and one person says something else, another person says something else. They made me run around the whole fucking semester, and that stupid, you know, woman is like, ","P1-N4002D2":"it’s your fault. And I’m just like, you know, fuck you. And they think that every student is just sitting on their ass, or like, smoking pot. And I’m just like, you have no fucking idea. Students at Amherst—they’re really outliers in terms of, like, the kinds of responsibilities ","P1-N4002D3":"that are on their shoulders. Like Chris tells me these things, and I’m amazed at the kind of students he has. They work ridiculous hours, and work in factories, and this and that. To have no empathy from, like, some bitch who’s just sitting in the chair doing accounts, and is applying the ","P1-N4002D4":"same kind of logic to every single student, because every student is a fucking number to her. It’s just like, I just wanted to slap her, you know? (chuckling)
THERAPIST: Mhm. A year and a half.
CLIENT: Have I been less that I described to you—that things feel less intense?
THERAPIST: No, but you describe feeling more reflective.
CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, okay, that’s a change, then. I remember talking about Victor (sp?) and feeling that you have intensely felt things with him. You were like probing that, and I think I said something like, it feels good. You feel alive. That intensity, otherwise you feel dead. And then, you know, ","P1-N4003D1":"the fight with that woman at that Thanksgiving party. I felt things intensely. But then, that small an event or that get-together, this time I was going to Nepal (ph). Definitely didn’t feel it. Because that was nothing. It wasn’t like a face off or anything. Because if there was, I would ","P1-N4003D2":"feel things intensely. But I guess I was more reflective. I wouldn’t say reflective. The reflections came very, very quickly. And the things that I said were motivated by a lot of different, like, reactions to things. [00:22:20]
THERAPIST: Why wouldn’t this be a good place to talk about that?
CLIENT: I don’t know, I feel like I wouldn’t know how to begin to articulate any of that. So, if you talk about sex, does it become that you don’t want to have it? I don’t know much about that (chuckling).
THERAPIST: How would that work? That you’d talk about it, and then not want to have it?
CLIENT: Because you overanalyze it? Or analyze it? If you’re aware of doing something, doesn’t it trip you up? No? I guess it doesn’t have to.
THERAPIST: Yeah, trip you up how? [00:25:59]
CLIENT: I don’t know, I don’t know. Some things are deliberate, like cooking. You could describe every step, I guess that’s okay. But, I don’t know (pause). I guess I’m just thinking, wouldn’t it become mechanical? (chuckling) I don’t know. Like, is there more ","P1-N400531":"to be said? Like, yeah, I don’t really get turned on when Chris touches me, you know? I don’t know what more to say. Like how could we explore that? [00:26:52]
THERAPIST: Would you feel differently with Nelson? (sp?)
CLIENT: Yeah, and that’s just because there’s no baggage there. And I’ve deliberately thought of him as, hey, that’s sexy (chuckling). It’s my construction. Not to say that other women won’t find him sexy, but I feel like I’ve also done this subconscious work (ph).
THERAPIST: What do you guys watch?
CLIENT: Whatever. He’s like a Netflix addict, and he’s got this weird taste in movies that I just don’t get. We watch obscure—not that obscure—more standard things. And to be, that’s obscure. Less obscure as in less normal things. Because I feel like he doesn’t ","P1-N4005F1":"have that sort of background that one needs to cultivate genres, and the good directors and all that, because he works so much. Like he doesn’t even know “I Love Lucy.” I’m like, really? How is that possible? You’ve been in the U.S. for so long. Even if you’re not ","P1-N4005F2":"in the U.S., you’re supposed to know “I Love Lucy.” [00:29:26]
THERAPIST: What’s the difference between crying with Chris and Nelson?
CLIENT: I don’t know. I feel protected and safe with Chris. And I also kind of cry because I’m thinking, oh no, and I’m letting him go, or something. I just feel very vulnerable and scared with Chris. Or, I’m able to feel that way about not just him, but about other things. About ","P1-N400671":"other things with him. Because I guess—(pause), yeah, I guess I’m able to be small with Chris. Really, really small, because I felt small next to him. But with Nelson, I feel like I have to have it all together, or he’ll crush me. Like, I have this thick skin on, or this shield on ","P1-N400672":"with him. Because I don’t want to break down, you know? And have him walk all over me. But then I feel like, wait, he just did that (chuckling), when he criticized my clothes and everything. So I’m thinking, huh. [00:34:26]
THERAPIST: Important for what purpose? [00:36:09]
CLIENT: To fall in a relationship (ph), I don’t know.
THERAPIST: So you’re saying if you want to be with Nelson, that’s really important.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don’t even know if I want to be with him (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Well, you’re both at a place where you can’t really connect with each other. He’s continuing to go out with his ex-girlfriend, or have some flirtatious experience with her. And you feel attached to Chris, and I don’t hope this for you ultimately.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: I mean, ultimately you want to be with someone—I mean, I know you’re going through your stuff now, but ultimately you don’t want to be with someone who is flirting with another person. That’s like an ultimate goal. I understand now that things are complicated. You ","P1-N400791":"have complicated feelings towards Chris. But you don’t know if Nelson is working on himself the way you’re working on yourself.
CLIENT: As in? [00:37:10]
THERAPIST: Well, in terms of understanding your motivation. You know, you don’t want to be doing this for the rest of your life, I don’t think, in terms of being pulled between two men.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So you’re working on it. Whether he’s working on his issues that lead him to kind of be pulled, I’m not familiar. I just don’t know.
CLIENT: Yeah (pause). Yeah, I was asking him, like, what does this mean? I don’t know if I told you, but he said he wants revenge from her, you know?
THERAPIST: What do you mean? No, you didn’t say that. Revenge.
CLIENT: From his ex-girlfriend. Because she, quote, screwed him over, you know?
THERAPIST: And how is he getting revenge? I don’t understand.
CLIENT: I don’t know. He said, like, by showing her what she can’t have. Like, what? And the standard way of doing that is to take your current girlfriend and show her off. And then he’s like, oh, that’s how amateurs do that. Like, that’s so weird, are you an expert in this field?
THERAPIST: An expert in revenge.
CLIENT: Yeah, and then he’s like, no, you flirt in a way that makes the other person think, is that flirting or is it not? And I really don’t think she’s that stupid. So I don’t know. Like yeah, I don’t want to get involved in this, you know? [00:38:47]
THERAPIST: Chris is saying that?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because he feels, at times, inferior? Or what is it?
CLIENT: Well, I don’t think he feels inferior. He can never feel inferior. Maybe he can. But, like, he’s ambitious, so I guess he just sees what others have and he doesn’t. I don’t think he feels jealous. I don’t think he feels inferior. Maybe he’s trying to find ","P1-N4009D1":"a motivation in that? Yeah, I think that’s accurate. To work even harder. Like, oh, this guy has this many publications out, work. I think that might be his thinking. [00:42:37]
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: I don’t know. I’m getting older, and I don’t want to be dating. I already date (ph).
THERAPIST: It’s unfortunate that you feel it has to be one of the other.
CLIENT: Yeah? Why?
THERAPIST: Because there are some pretty serious problems with each of them.
CLIENT: Yeah? Like what?
THERAPIST: Well, Nelson wants to get revenge on somebody. I don’t think that’s a really good sign, right? And Chris—I don’t know what will happen with Chris. There are some things that you really have questioned, in terms of a long-term relationship. I don’t know.
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I just think of him, and I think of this moments where I’ve been unhappy with him. And that’s all I think. In the sense that, like, when the question of commitment comes up. Like the trip to Portland, or whatever. It just sits on me, and it’s this burden. Like, ","P1-N400B11":"no! I don’t want that. [00:45:16]
THERAPIST: Cecelia (sp?), we really need to stop for today, but I’ll see you on Monday.
CLIENT: Okay, thank you.
THERAPIST: Take care, bye.
