DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her confusion over which man of the two she is dating with whom she feels more comfortable.
THERAPIST: Come on in. [00:01:31]
THERAPIST: What’s going on with you today? [00:06:30]
CLIENT: Nothing. Not sure what to say (chuckling).
THERAPIST: You don’t only do that. Sometimes, you talk about something that you thought about from the last time you talked, or something that’s been on your mind.
CLIENT: Yeah, I can’t remember what we talked about last time (chuckling). I think about feeling constructive versus destructive, but I hadn’t really had any thoughts about that (pause). I spent time with Chris (sp?) this week, a little more than usual, and like, it makes me sad (chuckling). ","P1-N400171":"He’s been sad because I’ve been, you know, gone. So I feel guilty and responsible, but then I also don’t want to give up what I think is exciting, even though it’s not always exciting. [00:08:55]
THERAPIST: Do you miss Chris?
CLIENT: What does that mean?
THERAPIST: What does missing someone mean?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Well, you said he misses you.
CLIENT: Yeah, I did say that (pause). I can’t miss him, because he’s, like, right there, you know? (chuckling) We’re very connected, like I can text him anytime and find him on GChat, or I can call him (chuckling). So I guess I don’t miss him in that way. [00:12:51]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:21:05)
CLIENT: (pause) Well, just, I mean, this week, and when I saw him with anyone, it made me feel (chuckling). (pause) When he’s, like, happy or smiling, or responsive, then I feel really good. Then when he shuts up for any reason, then I can tell he’s, you know, wanting specifically not to ","P1-N4003F1":"communicate that. It just really bugs me to no end. Like, I hate it. I guess it got that way, but, at one point, I didn’t really recover from feeling awful until I lapsed (ph), you know? [00:22:30]
THERAPIST: You said that in reaction to feeling betrayed?
CLIENT: Well, I’m saying it now. I don’t know if I actually said it back then. I may have. I mean, I don’t really blame him for that too much. Maybe I do, but I don’t think I do, because it was also my fault. I wasn’t really adventurous, or didn’t really initiate ","P1-N4004D1":"it. I didn’t really know if I wanted to. So, I might have pushed him away on countless occasions (chuckling). Because I wasn’t attracted to him, or I felt too self-conscious and low to be in the mood for it. [00:28:44]
THERAPIST: I don’t think so. I think it’s how you perceive it. You elevate these men, and you sort of downgrade what you do.
CLIENT: Well, I try really hard to, like, coordinate (ph) it off and protect it, but...
THERAPIST: You can value the creativeness in what you do. And your aspirations, in doing something that’s actually very difficult, and has less clear of a path or trajectory as getting your doctorate and then going through your professorship. Not to say that that’s easy. But you could value ","P1-N400571":"that, but you don’t. Or at least, not at this moment. But then, you sort of identify it as something external. You know, externally, it’s less than these other pursuits, but it’s your perception. [00:32:54]
CLIENT: What do you mean externally?
THERAPIST: Well, you say getting a PhD is inherently more valuable, or it’s inherently more whatever. And I’m challenging that. I don’t think it’s true. I think it’s in the eyes of the beholder.
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, and that’s what I mean. Like, to be with someone who is like you, you wouldn’t be aware of all these different avenues of success, easy success. Not easy, but not as difficult a success. Just aware of them, that makes me feel kind of, I don’t know, less sure of ","P1-N4005D1":"my path. I might be wrong (chuckling). [00:33:52]
THERAPIST: I was thinking about how you started today (ph), talking about Chris missing you by virtue of him valuing you. And now you’re talking about how you feel you have lesser value than him, at least in this respect.
CLIENT: Yeah (pause). Oh, he has lesser value?
THERAPIST: No, you’re talking about feeling that he has more, that you have lesser value with respect to him, in terms of your career. You started talking about how he values you.
CLIENT: I don’t know if he values me. Just like, over time, when you’ve known someone for so long, and you’ve shared, you miss them. [00:34:48]
THERAPIST: That’s not true.
CLIENT: It is true (chuckling).
THERAPIST: I mean, you might miss a pet, but you could miss a pet very differently. But that’s also a way of just saying that you have no value. You value in terms of, sort of your position, but not who you are as a person.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don’t promote value. Just as such a, I don’t know, intangible? It’s just not easily graspable, it changes. How do you build value? How do you know that you’re valuable to someone, or just valuable? [00:35:49]
THERAPIST: Well, you certainly have a concept of it, because you say that other people have more value than you. So you have a sense of what value is. You just don’t usually ascribe it to you.
CLIENT: No, I mean, society values certain kinds of people. It has its own ideas of success. So that’s what I mean (chuckling). [00:36:24]
THERAPIST: But it’s different, sort of doing someone’s dishes and having that person appreciate it because they feel taken care of, versus you’re serving the function of a dishwasher.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: That’s what I mean. In other words, if you think about your value as simply the function that you’re serving for someone, relationships become quite transactional. Whereas if you’re doing the dishes for him as a symbol of your care, it’s no longer transactional. It’s ","P1-N4007F1":"not a function you’re serving, it’s an expression of your care for him. And not just dishwasher, or rent payer, where you’re interchangeable. Like this family, well, if you had a hamster, you’d miss it, too. They’re kind of interchangeable in that sense. [00:41:34]
CLIENT: Yeah, I think our relationship kind of got to that point, where the rent payer, and the dishwasher and the cook were only our functions.
THERAPIST: Well, you certainly felt that way, and you feel that way in a lot of relationships.
CLIENT: I’m trying to change (chuckling).
THERAPIST: I know, that’s what you’re talking about. You absolutely are. You’re thinking very deeply about that.
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I don’t know why, like, with Chris, things just got so transactional (chuckling). [00:43:28]
THERAPIST: It seems like the distance has provided you some perspective, and also sort of developing confidence in yourself as a woman.
CLIENT: Yeah, but it comes at a cost of him missing me and being sad. So it makes me feel a little guilty, but not too much because he’s not that sad. You know, he’s not, like, falling apart. [00:44:11]
THERAPIST: How would that help it feel less transactional?
CLIENT: Because I feel that way with Nelson in a sense that I’m attracted to him. He’d ask me to do something, like read his resume or something, and I’ll do it (chuckling). Like, oh, I like this person, I want to do this for them. (pause) With Chris, it’s not like that (chuckling). [00:45:27]
THERAPIST: We’re going to need to stop for today, okay? But I’ll see you on Wednesday.
CLIENT: Okay, see you. Thank you.
THERAPIST: Thank you. Take care.
