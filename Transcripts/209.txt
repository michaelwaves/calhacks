DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her anxiety issues and if she should go visit a clinic to get medication for it. Client discusses how great her relationship is going and how good she feels about life at the moment.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.
CLIENT: Hi.
THERAPIST: Hi.
CLIENT: Ugh. So...
THERAPIST: Do you want to start by talking about your e-mail, or...?
CLIENT: Yeah, sure! I just did a lot of thinking-and I have, I mean, it had nothing to do with last session, per se, necessarily, but just in general. [00:01:03]
THERAPIST: Do the friends that you have, do they have someone that they use that they like?
CLIENT: Yeah, my coworker former coworker, I guess has someone that she's-I don't know who they are, she hasn't offered the information up so I don't want to push it by asking. I don't know if she feels uncomfortable, if we were to see the same person.
THERAPIST: Well, yeah, I had a couple thoughts about it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...the MSU Anxiety Clinic has a very, very good reputation.
CLIENT: I'm going to write these things down, [if you don't mind] (ph). Sorry.
THERAPIST: I would definitely contact them. Again, I don't know (crosstalk at 00:03:26)...
CLIENT: If they might have a...
THERAPIST: ...if they have a waiting list and so forth, but they have a very, very good reputation.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: That's what came to my mind when I first (inaudible at 00:03:37) e-mail (ph), but I have one colleague in particular who works with a lot of CBT and DBT therapists, so she is-
CLIENT: What is DBT?
THERAPIST: DBT is, it's dialectic [sic] behavioral therapy. That's really for people who are very self-injurious and they need specific skills to deal with the self-injurious behaviors that (inaudible at 00:04:01). It's related to CBT but it's not something that (crosstalk at 00:04:06)...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...appropriate for you, but anyway, but she would be a good person for me to contact...
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: ...because she probably would have-because she works with a lot of auxiliary (ph) providers. I will definitely reach out to her.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: But yeah, I would definitely recommend (crosstalk at 00:04:23).
CLIENT: I'll look into the MSU Anxiety Clinic.
THERAPIST: Yeah, and also...God... knowing which way to-I mean, with a lot of things with your ulcer, too anything, there are so many different ways to go. I would give it a try, if it's something that you feel could help. I would give it a try.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: That's not to say that it couldn't be helpful.
CLIENT: Right. Yeah, I've been trying to do some reading and research it a little bit; haven't had the amount of time to read all the things I've bookmarked yet, because I started classes this week. Yeah, I don't know, I'm just looking.
THERAPIST: The focus is very different. CBT is much, much more structured. The goal of CBT is really to manage symptoms.
THERAPIST: My approach, ultimately, is to help alleviate symptoms...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...but it's not so focused. It's much more look (ph) at the underlying meanings of the symptoms...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...in the hopes that the symptoms will subside, once what's behind them...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...is better understood. It's definitely a less-linear approach, for sure...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...and so, each approach has pros and cons.
CLIENT: Right, and I wonder if...yeah, I don't know.
THERAPIST: I used to not think that CBT was so good for social anxiety...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...but then I worked with a couple of people who had other issues they wanted to talk about, but (inaudible at 00:07:23) CBT for the social anxiety, in particular, and found it very helpful, so...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...different people it's not only your symptom category, it's who you are and (crosstalk at 00:07:33).
CLIENT: Yeah, I know, absolutely.
THERAPIST: I will say CBT therapists seem more likely to want people to go on medication, because the research is such that it tends to much more effective with medication. I don't know if all CBT therapists will recommend that, but that's definitely what they research, that (inaudible at 00:08:32) ","P1-N400831":"combined is a much more effective...that doesn't mean you have to do it...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...I'm just warning you that that seems to be more their focus. They're also focused on how quickly can you alleviate symptoms?
CLIENT: Right. Yeah, no, I understand that.
THERAPIST: That doesn't mean that you have to go along with all the recommendations.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I think I just at least want to give it a...try, or at least see what happens, get evaluated by someone who-that's what they do, and see what they think. [00:09:03]
THERAPIST: I can't say, "Absolutely no," or, "Absolutely yes," I think.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: I would the say the one thing that would be important is-from my vantage point, on a very basic level, you'll feel better if you're able to let go a little bit. Whatever you use to hold on more tightly is not going to be to your advantage, but if you're able to use it to help you let go a ","P1-N4009F1":"little bit...of course, letting go, it sounds so simple...
CLIENT: Yeah, (inaudible at 00:11:51).
THERAPIST: ...but it's very complicated. That would be my-
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: To use CBT to get greater control over things, in some ways, feeds the problem. [00:12:02]
CLIENT: Right, and I guess that's not-that's how, I guess, the easier way to describe it, but that is my goal, is to be able to let it go and to just relax. That's what I wish I could just do, all the time, is just relax, because everything's going to be fine. That's what I would want to use it for, ","P1-N400A91":"is to be able-and I don't know if that's what would happen or not.
THERAPIST: I would also say that, just some people respond to more-structured environments better. [00:13:04]
CLIENT: I do. Yeah, I do. Even this week, being back in school and there's-I'm really busy, I have a shit-ton of work and it's great. I feel so much better already this week than I have in the last three months, now that I have to be here at this time, here at this time, I'm running around doing different ","P1-N400B11":"things, I have assignments I have to get done, people I have to go see.
THERAPIST: That's sort of redundant.
CLIENT: Exactly. I already have my Bachelor's degree. That's when I made the switch to this specialization. [00:16:00]
THERAPIST: And you have a goal. [00:17:00]
CLIENT: ...I do better in structured environments, yeah.
THERAPIST: But you have a goal, too. You're trying to do something very specific. It's not like you're just meandering about.
CLIENT: Right, right. Yeah, I've never done well when I have all this extra time on my hands, or when I'm just sitting around. I'm really bad at vacations. I can relax for a day or two, but then-and Amelia's the same way, which is great. We do well traveling together, because our ideal vacation is going ","P1-N400CF1":"to a new place and doing stuff and exploring and seeing things. I'm not good at sitting on a beach for a week with nothing to do. I get really antsy quickly.
THERAPIST: I'm sure I can find you at least one or two names. [00:18:00] Recommendations are always the best thing. I understand some people don't really feel comfortable asking their friends or whatever for therapists, but if your friends have a good experience, it's always a really good way to start, too.
CLIENT: Yeah. No, I might definitely ask Danielle. I know that we have-and just because she has a different...she's on a lot of medication, but they also arrived at that point after CBT didn't work on its own for her. She arrived at that conclusion on her own, but doing CBT for a while and then saying, ","P1-N400D51":""You know, this is-I'm not, I'm still feeling really anxious and my OCD is out of control so, okay, yeah, now I can go on medication," but I could ask her. I think it's someone local.
THERAPIST: Absolutely. One colleague, in particular, I'm pretty sure she'll have a few good referrals. I hope to hear back. I'll definitely send it out today and hope to hear from her in a couple of days.
CLIENT: Yeah, just let me know. [00:19:00] I'm not in an incredible rush.
THERAPIST: How are you and Amelia doing?
CLIENT: She's supportive of me wanting to try this. Yeah, we've just been doing really well. This is both of our first weeks back, so it's been nice. We've both been home a lot more. It's been fun, going to the gym together and doing more stuff together than when she has night classes.
THERAPIST: You feel in a better place than when the two of you came together?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. It's good.
CLIENT: Yeah. I think me coming here helped a lot. I think having a space where I could-I feel like I, instead of unleashing everything on Amelia all the time, I definitely saved it up and talked about it here. [00:23:09] I think that's important for me. Whether or not CBT helps or it doesn't help, ","P1-N400F51":"I realize that therapy is probably an important part of my life right now, that it's important for me to have a space that's not my relationship.
THERAPIST: What changed?
CLIENT: What changed, or if it's just been a slow process of me having this space to talk about everything once a week? Or if really coming back to school this week was a big shift for me, in a good way. [00:25:02] I'm (ph) feeling like I have things that I need to get accomplished.
THERAPIST: You learned things about your family. You'd asked your dad, you (crosstalk at 00:25:58)...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...about his history with anxiety or his history of treatment of anxiety.
CLIENT: Yeah. I always knew that it was there in the family, but I never knew the details, because we just didn't talk about it. Definitely. I'm glad that I asked, because I opened up some channels. Now, if I'm having a really tough day, I can call my dad.
THERAPIST: Have you done that recently?
CLIENT: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yeah, there's something else I'm freaking out about, I can't remember what it was.
THERAPIST: It sounds pretty cool.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I don't know. He hasn't called me when he's feeling exceptionally anxious. Sometimes, I'm on the phone with my mom and I can hear him yelling about something in the background and saying, "I'm just going to go work out," which is what he does when he gets anxious.
THERAPIST: That's pretty cool.
CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like I've gotten...I think a lot has happened since I started coming here, for sure. I'm sure that if a lot would continue to happen, I think I'm just letting my curiosity about this other kind of therapy; I just really want to give it a go. [00:29:10]
THERAPIST: Well, I really hope it works for you, and you could always feel free to come back or...
CLIENT: Thank you, yeah. I was going to ask if...
THERAPIST: Of course.
CLIENT: ...a couple months and this is not doing it for me, if I could give you a call.
THERAPIST: Absolutely, of course, of course. I want you to feel better.
CLIENT: Yeah!
THERAPIST: My goal is not for you (crosstalk at 00:29:28)...
CLIENT: We have the same goal, yeah.
THERAPIST: ...treatment with me, per se, although I like working with you. If you find that a more sort of structured treatment that's more focused on your symptoms is helping you, great.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I'm happy to do that.
CLIENT: If that's the case, I'll let you know I mean, I'll let you know either way.
THERAPIST: Sure. Yeah, no, I'd absolutely like to know, hear how you're progressing and hear if that...
CLIENT: Yep! Absolutely, absolutely. I don't know, I almost think that this was-I don't think I would have come to the conclusion about CBT. I think that this was still necessary. I don't think it was-it's funny, because I'm so obsessing controlling everything, but I also believe-I'm a very fortuitous ","P1-N4013F1":"(ph) person and I believe that everything happens for a reason not kind of, I really firmly believe that. As much as I want to be able to control everything that happens, I still think that one thing leads to another, and that's just how my life has-a lot of bigger things in my life have turned out.
THERAPIST: It's definitely a paradigm that you can relate to.
CLIENT: Yeah. [laughs] Yeah.
THERAPIST: In a sense, for you.
CLIENT: I don't know, maybe you're just catching me on a good day, but I just had a very positive appointment with my GI. [00:32:03]
THERAPIST: Oh, wait, I was going to ask you how that's going. That's great.
CLIENT: Yeah, and I'm going to try tapering the medicine (ph) down, because I've been asymptomatic for a while.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: That's exciting, too. Things are healing.
THERAPIST: That's great.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, and I feel good about. It feels nice, because now it's up to me and it's all about how I feel. If I feel okay, then I can which I do we can try, see what happens if I don't take the medicine for a day.
THERAPIST: That's great. [00:33:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. Of course, I'm nervous, because tomorrow I'm not going to take it. I'm still terrified that I'm going to feel sick, but hopefully I won't. I don't think I will. I haven't really felt sick in a month or two, now. If I feel sick, then I just take the medicine and then I feel better.
THERAPIST: I was thinking about what your dad would say about, "I don't know, I guess you'll die, then."
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. [laughs] Exactly, exactly.
THERAPIST: And sleep, (crosstalk at 00:34:46) eight hours.
CLIENT: And I had to sleep, yeah. I had to just let it go and I don't know if having to take this medicine helped a little bit.
THERAPIST: And then eating a late meal would interfere with your probably GI approach. [laughs] [00:35:01]
CLIENT: Yeah. It didn't work the first day, when I waited until midnight to take the medicine, because I have to take my stomach medicine a half-an-hour before I have my first meal. If I'm not hungry in the morning, then when I wake up, then it's really difficult to do that. I needed to take the antibiotics ","P1-N401711":"with the first meal, it was just (inaudible at 00:35:22), so it didn't work.
THERAPIST: I would think so.
CLIENT: Yeah. I was thinking, on my way home from the doctor appointment this morning about, I've been taking the stomach medicine for four months, now. [00:36:00] I don't think about it anymore. It's just part of my routine and doesn't really bother me (inaudible at 00:36:11), I don't know.
THERAPIST: Yeah. It does seem like there's an upward trend.
CLIENT: When I look back, when the first time Amelia and I came here, it was-I'm in a very-I feel much better, now, than I did then. [00:37:01] Still feel anxious, but I feel much, much better.
THERAPIST: Well, that's really cool.
CLIENT: Yeah! It's nice to think about it. When I look back...that makes me feel like I did work at something and did work my brain out, a little bit, so we'll see. I'm excited to see what CBT is and what it could do for me or couldn't, and then just see how it goes.
THERAPIST: Well, I guess I would definitely like to hear how that's going...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...when you find someone and start.
CLIENT: Yeah, absolutely. I'll keep you posted, and if it doesn't work out, then...or if I feel like this was a much better fit for me, then I'll definitely let you know, as well.
THERAPIST: EMDR?
CLIENT: I don't know, she said it was manually controlling my brainwaves.
THERAPIST: Well, electroshock therapy, you go to the hospital and get.
CLIENT: Right, (crosstalk at 00:39:32).
THERAPIST: It definitely would not be electroshock therapy.
CLIENT: Not the same as, but Amelia said it was like that. I mean, it didn't sound appealing even when this woman described it to me with nicer words.
THERAPIST: I'm guessing it was EMDR. I don't know that would be the only-it's a rapid eye movement, where you-do you remember if that's what she was describing?
CLIENT: The only thing she said was that we couldn't do it at her office in Wellesley, that I had to go to her office at a different location, because of the equipment she needed. [00:40:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah, they do use equipment for EMDR. People use it for trauma. Is that what she was thinking about?
CLIENT: I don't think so. We were just talking about my anxiety. I only gave it a go for three sessions, because she was really pushing me seeing her off-campus and using this equipment. I didn't know what she was talking about.
THERAPIST: I have no idea. The other thing I could think about was neurofeedback.
CLIENT: That's what it was.
THERAPIST: Oh, it as neurofeedback. I don't know much about neurofeedback, yeah. You wouldn't be shocked, though. [laughs]
CLIENT: No, I didn't think I was going to be shocked, but yeah. She said she would hook me and then she could make-I would start having anxious thoughts and then she would manually change the structure of my brainwaves or something to make me feel less anxious. [00:41:11] Her description freaked me ","P1-N401AF1":"out, of it, it wasn't something I'd be interested in.
THERAPIST: That's important, because you have a PPO. I think that that's correct.
CLIENT: Yeah, so that was the other thing is I was going to try to find someone in my network.
THERAPIST: The in-network PPO plan is much wider than HMO plan...
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: ...so I can certainly do that. Not everybody, but there are people like me who are also willing to sort of adjust their fee for grad students. I'll make sure to keep that in mind, that that's an important thing to think about.
CLIENT: Thanks, thank you, yeah. Whoever I talk to, before I set up an appointment, I'll let them know about that, as well. [00:42:05]
THERAPIST: That's okay.
CLIENT: I know it takes a while.
THERAPIST: They usually take a month, and now they've been taking more. Did you get the December one?
CLIENT: Yeah, I mailed it out to them.
THERAPIST: Okay. That's fine, you can just mail it to me when (crosstalk at 0 0:42:25).
CLIENT: Yeah, I'll mail both of those to you. I could write you a check right now for...
THERAPIST: For December and I guess (crosstalk at 00:42:32).
CLIENT: No, for January, because it's been today-or should I just wait? I'll just wait for Irra (sp?) to send me the statement, I guess.
THERAPIST: The check you gave me was for November.
CLIENT: It was for November and December.
THERAPIST: And December, okay, it was for both.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay, so it's for both. Okay, that's fine. You can just wait. You don't need to (crosstalk at 00:42:48).
CLIENT: Okay, so I have my checkbook if it would make it easier.
THERAPIST: It's up to you. I don't care either way.
CLIENT: I'll just write you a check, now.
THERAPIST: Okay. You meant the two times in...?
CLIENT: Yeah, in January.
THERAPIST: That will be fine, okay. [00:43:01]
CLIENT: Yeah, I'll just do that now.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess we have just a minute or so-okay, that's fine. I will make note of this. I would say early next week I'll have some names for you that...
CLIENT: Yeah, that would be great. I appreciate it. I would definitely trust your recommendation more than my own Googling.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: You said it was two sessions?
THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess so! The (crosstalk at 00:43:45).
CLIENT: Yeah, because I came back from Oregon...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Yeah, we didn't meet on (inaudible at 00:43:51) because of the snowstorm [that was] (ph)...
THERAPIST: The snowstorm.
CLIENT: ...after New Year's, right.
THERAPIST: Thank you.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: I will be in touch within the week...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...and please stay in touch.
CLIENT: Absolutely.
THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:44:51)
CLIENT: Thanks for everything.
THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:44:51) for you.
CLIENT: All right.
THERAPIST: I'll (inaudible at 00:44:52) to you soon. Take care, Kelsey.
CLIENT: You, too.
