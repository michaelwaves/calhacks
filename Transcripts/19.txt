TITLE: Client "L" Therapy Session Audio Recording, January 15, 2014: Client discusses an embarrassing memory from his childhood that he hasn't told anyone before. Client discusses the trust issues in his marriage.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses an embarrassing memory from his childhood that he hasn't told anyone before. Client discusses the trust issues in his marriage.
THERAPIST: Hi, (inaudible at 00:00:07).
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:01:33)
CLIENT: I have a check for you.
THERAPIST: Oh, thank you!
CLIENT: But I don't get paid until tomorrow, so if you could wait until Friday to cash it, (crosstalk at 00:01:54).
THERAPIST: No problem, no problem.
CLIENT: Normally, I would just bring it next week but Genevieve's (sp?) e-mail suggested it you wanted it in two weeks, which would be Tuesday. [00:02:04]
THERAPIST: Is that what she said? Okay. [laughs]
CLIENT: [laughs]
THERAPIST: A few weeks, it doesn't matter as much, but thank you.
CLIENT: You're welcome.
THERAPIST: Thinking about it, and then being in my presence, that difference... [00:03:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...that (inaudible at 00:03:01).
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. You know, I think if I had seen you Thursday, also, it would have been easier for this. We talked some about that time period seemed to matter for reasons which are not exactly clear to me.
THERAPIST: What do you think it would have been like to come in Thursday?
CLIENT: Oh, I don't know, but my guess is that it would have been much like this, but a little bit less so. That's a guess, not really a-I don't know.
THERAPIST: But that somehow, that easier part would be that it would have been easier for you to tell me what was-the things that came up for you about what we would talk about in here.
CLIENT: Yeah, that's the theory. Whether it's true or not, I don't... [00:05:00]
CLIENT: Yeah, and it's not particularly clear that that would have made very much difference.
CLIENT: I guess I wanted to start with a couple of things from my childhood or adolescence that I find embarrassing or shameful but are not particular terrible, I don't think. [00:07:00]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:09:15), you don't know how old you were then, just somewhat younger.
CLIENT: I think I was younger, so I would say I was between 10 and 13, and she's a couple of years younger than I am.
THERAPIST: And the embarrassing part?
CLIENT: Well, any sort of sexual contact with siblings is fairly taboo, so I think that's the embarrassing part. [00:10:03]
THERAPIST: I don't think confused. I'm trying to understand, you know, what-you prefaced it by saying various things, so I wasn't sure what, you know...
CLIENT: Like I said, I'm interested that I told you the stories and then you said, "Okay. Are we going to get to the embarrassing part?"
THERAPIST: Well, right, and that's, in a sense, what I was suggesting as suggesting as there's not an inherently embarrassing part. You're bringing the experience of having it be embarrassing, and my curiosity about that experience.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Not that there's the unembarrassing [sic] part and then the embarrassing part.
CLIENT: [laughs]
THERAPIST: I was taking away the objectivity in that proclamation, and the (inaudible at 00:10:53), you know, with the experience of the embarrassment was (inaudible at 00:10:59).
CLIENT: Yeah. I think I understand better. In thinking about it myself, I...it's not that hard to come terms with. It's just a thing that...
CLIENT: ... [no one's harmed] (ph), it's not particularly unusual, I don't think, in any real regard. It's a little weird, but most things that happen in the world are a little bit weird. [00:12:00]
THERAPIST: Judged for being what?
CLIENT: I think bad, in some way.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think that's the way to interpret taboos as, "You should not do this thing." That's sounds...yeah...bad in that sense of violating some ethical proclamation that any particular observer may or may not actually have. [00:14:08]
THERAPIST: And the bad is attached to the sisters more than attached to the sexual?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, I think.
THERAPIST: Right, because that could also be that...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...it's more about being sexual than who was involved.
CLIENT: Right...
THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:14:24)
CLIENT: ...no, I think it's the sisters, yeah.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:14:27)
CLIENT: Yeah, because certainly, there was probably a taboo on sex, in general, in the organization that I grew up in. My mother has very strong norms against a wide variety of things, but among them being premarital sex. [00:15:00] That doesn't seem to be the relevant thing, here. Yeah. At least not ","P1-N400971":"to me maybe it is, but it doesn't ring true.
THERAPIST: What did it feel like to tell me that?
CLIENT: I'm still trying to figure that out. Once I got over the anxiety of sitting down and looking at you, it was relatively simple to, you know-it's just words. [00:16:00]
THERAPIST: Such a funny kind of statement, but I was thinking, being a scientist in one's personal life is not a bad thing.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Being a sort of empiricist, you know. [00:17:02] You check something out. You see if it's, you know, you have a hypothesis but you test it, versus just verifying your hypothesis because you want to. It's not a bad thing to live your personal life that way.
CLIENT: Okay. Thanks! I was certainly thinking that was sort of what I've done, it's sort of...thanks.
THERAPIST: When you think about (inaudible at 00:18:13) that how to build it or rebuild it, if you think about what you would like to be there, what needs to be there, what kind of trust what is that?
CLIENT: I think there are two separate pieces. One, I think, is I need to be able to trust her to take care of herself, which, that one...it's sort of going okay, my confidence in her ability to handle herself and her emotions is increasing.
CLIENT: ...I don't exactly know how to phrase it, but a trust in...
CLIENT: ...a guess a trust in her ability and interest in taking care of me? [00:20:03]
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I feel like she expresses an interest in taking care of me, but either it's not that strong an interest or she doesn't really have the ability.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:23:47)
CLIENT: I was just going to say I felt like it's a fairly petty example, but in some sense, but it feels like it has more significance, in some way, like it's a...a token of a particular type or something. [00:24:04]
THERAPIST: My mind went in this direction, a different direction; I picked up on the, just contagious piece. Thinking about certainly not overtly, like you were suggesting this, but how contagious is her despair and her depression? How contagious is it to your, you know, possible future children? That's ","P1-N400D51":"where my mind went; it's that issue of contagiousness and her illness.
CLIENT: Hmm.
CLIENT: Have we talked much about this before?
THERAPIST: Not really.
CLIENT: Okay, okay, because I've thought about it some (ph), but I couldn't-it's been long enough since I've thought about it that I couldn't remember whether we talked about it at all.
THERAPIST: I guess it depends on what you're defining as "this."
CLIENT: [laughs] That's fine. The sort of contagion idea. I definitely thought about my experience in Illinois as being colored by her depression, to a large extent. Certainly, it is, in the sense that I left there, physically, but also...even before I left there, you know, we talked every day and she ","P1-N400E51":"had a lot of bad days, and so it's...it's hard to cope with a heavy workload in a relationship with is more one-directional, in terms of support. [00:26:05] Then go back and work hard the next day, and do it again. I think it's...yeah, certainly I think some of that...despair has been contagious.
THERAPIST: Drug use, recreational versus hardcore drug use.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I think that analogy holds, in that circumstance, also, right? Before you recognize, "Oh, that's gone too far," it's easy to elevate along with the person, I think. [00:27:02]
THERAPIST: What would happen?
CLIENT: I don't know. [00:29:00] It seems fairly clear to me that the part of her...part of her work in therapy has been (inaudible at 00:29:09) her childhood experiences of trauma and their relation to her more-recent traumas, and her childhood experiences all related to her father and mother both ","P1-N400F71":"being depressed and angry. That seems like not a good circumstance to recreate on a new set of children.
THERAPIST: Do you think about that? [I mean] (ph), is it something on your mind sometimes, or (ph)...?
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mostly, these thoughts weren't off-the-cuff, they were sort of there, I just don't...I don't have much...I don't have the answers for them. [00:30:06]
THERAPIST: Do you still see Dr. Jannis (sp?)?
CLIENT: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Yeah, I would have told you if we had stopped.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess the way I worded it was...I guess I worded it that way because it's not something...in talking about your relationship with Tanya, it's not something that you've mentioned where you were mentioning it before, so maybe that's why I worded it [like that] (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah. We've sort of have been dealing with it, like a different project you and I have that's now converged back, so we're back to talking about it. [00:31:03]
THERAPIST: I certainly agree with that, that all of your trust issues don't just relate to Tanya.
CLIENT: Yes, we talked this week in that (ph) session about actually trust, in some ways, but...I guess Dr. Jannis summarized it in a-we have very different approaches to the world, and we have different styles of approaching the world, Tanya and I do, and that's true. [00:33:00]
CLIENT: Yeah, so I guess he went on to suggest that the collision of those is a difficult thing in any relationship, particularly in any new marriage.
THERAPIST: It's a pretty heavy topic. [00:34:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
CLIENT: Were you saying that in a sort of supportive way, as an invitation to talk about it more if I wanted to?
THERAPIST: Not explicitly.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: It was more of a comment.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: It wasn't explicit. I wasn't not inviting you, but...
CLIENT: That's fine (ph).
THERAPIST: Did it feel like I was saying, "Say more about that?"
CLIENT: It wasn't particularly (ph) clear to me what you were saying, other than, "That's a heavy topic," so I was, I guess, inquiring.
THERAPIST: Well, the way you phrased it, that it-what you're saying is it's not-I mean, sort of to put it bluntly, one version of what you were saying or one interpretation is, "Dr. Jannis was minimizing this, that it's not simply like I like chocolate and she likes vanilla, it's that her approach was ","P1-N401371":"actually destructive." [00:35:14] I guess I was commenting on that heaviness.
CLIENT: Yeah, so I think it's probably a little uncharitable to describe his view that way, particularly-not that you were doing it, but I was.
THERAPIST: What made you think about the time? Is there something you want to bring up, or you're just curious?
CLIENT: I felt this-there's always more to talk about that I don't want to get into. I don't want to go down a path that was going to take forever or something, take longer than we have. I was trying to use how much time we have left as a way of sorting out what...
THERAPIST: I know I've been the one to bring this up several times. Concerned about feeling kind of heavy-handed, and you need to know if that's true. I was wondering if you wanted to try to meet twice a week for a few weeks, and see if it makes a difference or if it's fine just going back to once a week.
CLIENT: Yeah.
CLIENT: I appreciate you offering again, and it's not heavy-handed. [00:40:02] It's okay. I guess I'm reluctant for three reasons, all of which are sort of interesting for one reason or another, so I'll try to get through all of them.
THERAPIST: Well, that's something we should talk about, regardless of whether you come once or twice a week. That's an important thing (inaudible at 00:41:30), but yeah.
CLIENT: Like I said, I thought most of them were interesting in one way or another. Now I've lost count, whether that was three or...
THERAPIST: That was two.
CLIENT: Yeah, well, I'm not sure if that was two or if it was still part of one.
THERAPIST: Oh, I see.
CLIENT: Yeah, I can't-I think that was related to (inaudible at 00:42:01).
THERAPIST: That's a lot.
CLIENT: Yeah, it is. I feel like it's been worth it, and...switching to any other insurance system because Tanya has a different insurance that does cover most of or some percent of the sessions...and once a week, the two are about cost-equivalent, so all that I'm doing is not paying the insurance ","P1-N4016B1":"and paying you directly; but because of that, seeing your more often increases the cost directly, so I guess I'm reluctant there, also, because don't have a lot of money. [00:43:00]
THERAPIST: Well, the latter part-I mean, it's still an issue, but I don't know, maybe, the latter part is certainly if you came an extra time a week, I could offer you a reduce fee or more of a reduced fee for that extra time. It's still more than zero, so it doesn't completely [laughs] address it, ","P1-N4016D1":"but just to-and maybe that whatever we work out still feels like a little too much, so, you know, I appreciate that piece but just to let you know that that's an option. But that's the only one of the few concerns that you raised.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: With all things being equal, when someone wants to see more frequently and the only obstacle is finances, I really do my best to do something with that.
CLIENT: Thanks.
THERAPIST: Well, the first two are related because they're-the first two, in terms of what if you can't come twice a week once you start working, you know, done with your degree, and the sort of sharing-wanting to talk more with me than with Tanya is sort of like, "Well, what if I like it too much?" ","P1-N401771":"[00:44:09] I mean, they're both versions of that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: They're different facets of it, but that's sort of what...
CLIENT: [laughs] Yeah, that's a...yeah.
THERAPIST: It's not like, "Oh, I'm going to dread coming here. What if I have to come here when (ph) I hate it?"
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: [Or anything like that] (ph).
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: As you point out, in terms of interesting, they're important to talk about, regardless of what we decide to do. Because they're true, regardless.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: The feeling is true, regardless.
CLIENT: That's right.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:44:46), out of time.
CLIENT: It's okay, I knew that was going to happen.
THERAPIST: But we have next week!
CLIENT: [laughs]
THERAPIST: I may have mentioned this already, I'm away the first week in February...
CLIENT: Okay. [00:45:00]
THERAPIST: ...it's still a few weeks away, but just I'm not sure if I mentioned it, but...
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: ...yeah, okay.
CLIENT: You did it mention it...
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: ...and I wasn't sure if I remembered you mentioning it or not (crosstalk at 00:45:07).
THERAPIST: Okay, okay, very good. I will see you next week.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay, bye-bye.
