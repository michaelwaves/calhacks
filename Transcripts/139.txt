TITLE: Client "D" Therapy Session Audio Recording, April 29, 2014: Client talks about her distaste for her husband's mother and sister.
DESCRIPTION: Client talks about her distaste for her husband's mother and sister.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.
CLIENT: I was thinking about how it sort of feels like if I were to…I’m thinking [inaudible – 03:05] because I’ve been marking papers and explaining to far too many students how they…how structured their paper is and this way it looks…actually making an argument. ","P1-N4000F1":"So…[pause.]. Not to mention pointing out which words are verbs and which words are nouns. So even if there were writing and it sucked somehow, it’s one of those journals we start for school about what happened this week. [inaudible – 03:45]. How on earth do you actually know what the ","P1-N4000F2":"right thing to do is? [Pause.]
THERAPIST: I’m not sure I follow how Laura ended up deciding to stay with you after she said, “Fine, fine, never mind.”
CLIENT: [Pause.] Basically, Kathleen asked her how the…what it would take to get her to say how she actually felt about it and that it wasn’t gracious enough invitation, basically. It wasn’t. She invited herself. But…and Kathleen reiterated that it was…he thought it was ","P1-N4002F1":"fine for her to stay but it just…it’s just a fact that we have other stuff on our plate. I’m not sure I would have done the same thing.
THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?
CLIENT: I’m thinking back to that just sort of ended back up at the visit with…over the weekend after [inaudible – 23:30]. About what I was saying, I had a feeling, not before that. Anxiety has sort of got me lodged with Kathleen holding out and [pause]…sort of connected back ","P1-N4003F1":"to something else. They’re planning this sort of family vacation in Hilton Head and asked us to come. And they said that if Kathleen said no we couldn’t. And Kathleen replied that it would be like if she took Genevieve for a week so that we could have some time on our own. I mean, obviously, ","P1-N4003F2":"the answer is no. But [pause]…
THERAPIST: You know, I started to think about it. It’s kind of a looser sensation. But I started thinking about when I think it was when you moved back to Cleveland the second time and felt like this sort of child-like clueless happy-go-lucky innocence was lost and you were sort of forced in to ","P1-N4004B1":"this world of these kids that just felt terrible and feeling kind of communized by these ways in which – not that your sister was colonizing you per se, but I’m sure there’s perfectionism and all these other things that felt so foreign to you. I think you were being taken over. [Pause.]
CLIENT: It’s funny. I sort of caught on to that reading. That’s where I started to read the Odyssey. It sort of comes to me. I have these sort of reading lesson story ideas that get attached to things. [Pause.] Wonder whether the part of the concern about that sort of decisiveness is [pause]…
THERAPIST: Taking over her mind.
CLIENT: Yeah. I worry that, you know, about when I see it going, Patricia, Kathleen, Laura, Genevieve? I think yes. I think I do worry about that. [Pause.] I think I do [inaudible – 31:36] you know it’s obviously a bad example or pattern. It’s just I can’t…I certainly can’t ","P1-N400531":"prove it as a way of…I don’t think any of them are particularly happy as people and I feel like this might bother you as a parent. [inaudible – 31:53] do what’s best for the child. And [pause]…that’s not how I want things to turn out. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: They do it, too, with an openness to that new experience and not a set of predetermined fears or expectations or…
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: They don’t begin by saying, “Oh, I think something bad is going to happen.”
CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.] Just definitely [inaudible – 39:15] like that. You start to see it coming, I guess. There’s that, you know, [pause] now that Laura’s asked to come, well inevitably we’re going to have some kind of argument or phone call of some kind about where she’s ","P1-N4006F1":"going…I know she’s going to come overnight and where she’s going to stay and what’s going to happen. [Pause.] And to some extent there was no voiding. There’s no…we didn’t know that she was going to be asking about coming to spend the night. That wasn’t ","P1-N4006F2":"the original plan, but [pause.]
THERAPIST: Not engaged her around this dance she’s trying to engage you in and just take what she’s saying at face value. It doesn’t seem like she’s welcome. Okay, well where else can we find you to go?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because in a sense, she’s not…I mean she’s not…I mean on a deep sense she’s not, but in a practical sense that was sort of what was explicitly conveyed. This was not a good time. So it’s not…I imagine you feel some guilt around the deeper feelings ","P1-N4007B1":"about her never being welcome. But there is also the explicit statement about giving sort of the timing and so forth, actually, this is not the best time.
CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly.
THERAPIST: And so to take her up on that rather than engaging with her around her sense of being, her sense of feeling the entitlement to have entry in to your life and your home at any given moment. Put that aside.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. [Pause.] It does sort of feel, basically, like she just…she wanted us to beg.
THERAPIST: She wanted to engage you in this kind of…and there’s not much you can do about Kathleen engaging with her around that, except for talking with her. But if he does want to engage with her around that, then so be it. But you certainly don’t.
CLIENT: Yes. Thank you.
THERAPIST: Great, yes. Take care.
