TITLE: Client "S" Therapy Session Audio Recording, January 16, 2013: Client discusses her attraction to the "darkness", regarding the people and life to which she is attracted.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her attraction to the "darkness", regarding the people and life to which she is attracted.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.
CLIENT: You're working today as well.
THERAPIST: I'm sorry?
CLIENT: No, you're working today as well with all of the snow. (chuckle) Did you drive here? (chuckle)
THERAPIST: Does it seem not good to drive?
CLIENT: No, it's scary. (chuckle)
THERAPIST: It's scary?
CLIENT: Yeah. Pretty but scary. (chuckle) let's see. Last week (chuckle) I mentioned to Chris about the couples therapy, and he's like, "Okay, I won't make you a schedule." (laughter) Even I try to press him and say, "No, I really am interested." I had to trick him into telling me what the schedule ","P1-N400191":"was going to be. He didn't like going -
THERAPIST: So he interpreted that as punishment for making you a schedule? Interpreted the couple's therapy as punishment?
CLIENT: Yeah. He was like, "Oh, my god," just yeah. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'll go back to being aloof." (chuckle) So (pause) yeah. [00:01:58]
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you had your own associations. You said you wondered if you'd be like this, so clearly there was something you had in mind about it.
CLIENT: I would think specifically it just sounded right. (laughter) (pause) Yeah, I just wondered because I thought maybe you would have a more objective reading of me and him emotionally, like you would have a specific idea of darkness. [00:03:40]
THERAPIST: I think in objective readings, there's less truth, not more.
CLIENT: What do you mean less truth?
THERAPIST: Well, the fact that it resonates with you, to me, speaks to the fact that there's something true about it, and it's a question of what it is. My "objective" reading about darkness seems like it would get away from that truth, not necessarily move toward it.
CLIENT: What truth?
THERAPIST: The truth of what the darkness means, for example. I'm using your words truth, because you said that it felt true, but you're not clear what.
CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know if I should think about the qualities of this boy, or my qualities, or discovering some of my qualities through him. (chuckle) [00:04:38]
THERAPIST: This happens a lot where you latch on to an idea. You like it. You'll think about it, you'll bring it up in here, this idea whatever the idea is this time, it's about this attraction to darkness, and then you're not really sure what to do with the idea, so you say, "Well, you define the ","P1-N400311":"idea. It's your idea, so you tell me what the idea means."
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Let's use your definition, and then you sort of then try to figure out from there what to do, but it's a very interesting phenomenon, it happens a lot.
CLIENT: Yeah. No, it happens in other spheres as well, I just get stumped, or feel stumped, and don't know how to proceed after that. (chuckle) I don't know why. [00:05:34]
THERAPIST: Yes, I think that's what it means.
CLIENT: (laughter) I don't know. Why do I get stumped with I'm just trying to think, my mind is going a little blank, but I'm trying to yeah. Well, with darkness, let's see. I think of myself as not a very dark person or didn't until now, but well, okay. So about him, it's his caveman attributes, ","P1-N4003D1":"and staying indoors, not going out, not having so many friends, and doing things that don't mean well to friends, but also having a lot of beauty while doing that, like it fosters or something. The lines are beautiful. The concept is beautiful, the idea is brilliant, beautiful, but it's dark. [00:07:09]
THERAPIST: So being in the light is being under scrutiny?
CLIENT: Yeah, if you're not a caveman, if you're not yeah. If you're in the light, that would mean generally there's that means that there are other people around, and everyone can see everyone. Like an optical or something. That's what I think. And I guess one thing to be a writer, we're supposed ","P1-N400431":"to experiment with everything, not realize not everything, maybe when you're in 20s and you're supposed to experiment with everything, and then by the time you're in your mid-20s or late 20s, you know what your thing is and you stick to that. [00:09:05]
THERAPIST: What made you say that?
CLIENT: I don't know. I feel like we don't have a theme today, or maybe we do, but (pause) -
THERAPIST: Did you feel like I wasn't following you?
CLIENT: No, no, no. I was just wondering if I was following me. (chuckle) I mean, yeah. (pause) Yeah, then (pause) I'm not sure whether one should, or I should cultivate my dark side. I mean, it's nice to be powerful, but not so nice to use it to hurt people. Or not to hurt people, but to just get what ","P1-N400511":"you want, but then it's nice to get what you want. But I have no feelings, I'm not sure. I feel like Victor (ph) uses this darkness to get women, but I don't have that. I don't need women, I don't need men. I do, however, need to be a good writer. That is my desire. And if cultivating a dark side would ","P1-N400512":"help that (chuckle) but I don't know. Being bold is definitely something that I need more of, but I wonder if there can be other sources for being bold. [00:13:13]
THERAPIST: Is there any power in lightness?
CLIENT: I feel like too much of Star Wars and Chris. (laughter) The light sabers and all that. (laughter) Can you expand on that?
THERAPIST: I don't know. I don't have a particular idea in mind. I'm just wondering, you said there's only power in darkness.
CLIENT: No, I didn't. Did I say only?
THERAPIST: I thought you said that.
CLIENT: Not (crosstalk).
THERAPIST: Well, if you didn't say that, then I guess the question is what is the power in lightness?
CLIENT: Being right, being righteous. Being loved and respected by all because you don't make missteps, and if you do make missteps, they're in the light and then you get to experience other people's forgiveness, which is also pretty nice. [00:14:16]
THERAPIST: I'm sorry, end up getting?
CLIENT: Hurt.
THERAPIST: I see. [00:15:23]
CLIENT: But I don't know. Now why are we even talking about this? (chuckle) I guess being attractive to bad persons is what we were saying. (pause) I guess there are writers who write with dark people, and they may not necessarily be dark themselves. They're just seeing it up close. (pause) I kind of ","P1-N4006B1":"lost my friend now. (laughter) (pause) And I suppose I will always be in touch with darkness because there's been darkness in my past because of my dad, so every time I need any darkness, all I have to do is tap into that. (laughter) And maybe seek out some dark people if I need any, because I'm in ","P1-N4006B2":"the light now and there don't seem to be any dark people about. [00:17:01]
THERAPIST: Where did your mind go?
CLIENT: Well, a lot of places. I was thinking of what else I could talk about. It's just this dilemma of Chris being so driven, and if you take the drive out, he's nothing. And then you construct your life around that, and maybe some of his images for your benefit, and then you feel too tied to too ","P1-N400711":"judged if you don't perform, and stifled. (chuckle) And then you go for someone much darker with many facets, and then they just will leave you (chuckle) high and dry by yourself (ph). [00:22:32]
THERAPIST: What do you feel like you should be thinking about instead?
CLIENT: I don't know. Ideas, stories. (laughter) I don't know. Something creative and constructive. (pause) So I somehow I came privy to Victor's e-mails to other women (chuckle) and he used the same he used to use the same I don't know if I should call them techniques that he used with me, in his ","P1-N400771":"mother tongue, all the music, and art. (pause) And some didn't take the bait, and then some did. [00:25:23]
THERAPIST: Those are two very different questions. Would every woman fall for Victor, and should you not be so hard on yourself? Two totally different questions.
CLIENT: (laughter) Okay, all right.
THERAPIST: Do those feel like the same?
CLIENT: But they're related. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I want to stop feeling bad, and seeing the lows and this and that, all the negative stuff, for having fallen for him. And I guess with the darkness questions, I don't understand why I felt, and what kind of need he met, you know, satisfied, ","P1-N400851":"and why I had that need in the first place, and this and that. And yeah, just try to understand that whole thing, and try to move on, and try to yeah, because very early on I said I feel I can't create beauty on my own, and now I see that I can. I may lack joy in creating that beauty, but that might ","P1-N400852":"be my temperament because of being depressed and stuff, but I know there's hard evidence that I can create beauty. [00:30:57]
THERAPIST: Do you think I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
CLIENT: Yeah, go ahead.
THERAPIST: Do you think your temperament is being depressed?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Really?
CLIENT: I don't want to be. I want to have joy, but more often than not, I feel I don't. Maybe I do, but why did you ask?
THERAPIST: Striking statement. Profound statement about how you see yourself. I actually don't for whatever it's worth, I don't agree, you know, if I'm -
CLIENT: You don't see how I'm -
THERAPIST: Clairvoyant, or I don't know if clairvoyant would be the right word, but to know something like that would be an interesting kind of knowing, how would I know that really, but I don't think that's true.
CLIENT: Tell me what temperament is that? [00:31:57]
THERAPIST: Well, those are two different things too, being depressed and being sad, I see are very different things.
CLIENT: Okay. Me?
THERAPIST: That's interesting, because I don't think anyone's temperament is to be sad. I don't know. That's an emotion, I think. I think people do have tendencies to be depressed, or an innate tendencies. I don't see that in you really though.
CLIENT: Yeah?
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: Well, that's good news.
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: Yeah. So why is that, or do you -
THERAPIST: Because you're somebody who, to me, who seems like she seeks life more than anything else, and I feel like there are ways I mean, there's so many things that have happened in your life that would lead you to feel sad and shut down at times. Disconnected, maybe, behind a glass wall. I didn't ","P1-N400AB1":"really see that as your temperament.
CLIENT: Mm. I would like to have life and make beauty and meaning. I guess I have a lot of anxieties that shut me down, but I hope to conquer them (chuckle) someday. [00:33:18]
THERAPIST: I think your mother has a tendency to be depressed, but I don't see you as like her in that way at all.
CLIENT: It's funny, she has a tendency, but she spends far less time actively being sad than me. (laughter) It's funny that way.
THERAPIST: How so?
CLIENT: She always occupies her mind, or her hands. She's always making something, art or stuff, or watching TV. She hardly ever sits around and says negative things, like actively, like of the kind that I may do, and my tendency is to seek out hurt, to hurt myself, and she doesn't have that. Yeah. ","P1-N400B51":"Yeah. But I kind of judge her and feel more sad, like look at the art you're making, it's not as pretty, or the food you've got is not as delicious, or you've wasted your hours watching TV. (chuckle) But she doesn't have that judgment on her head so much as I do. [00:35:09]
THERAPIST: What's changed in that respect?
CLIENT: (crosstalk).
THERAPIST: Not feeling as guilty about your mom?
CLIENT: Well, I don't see her as much as I used to, not living with her, and she seems to be doing okay. I see her every day anyways, so I feel okay when I'm around. Yeah, I mean, (chuckle) and I'm doing my own work. I'm able to, so I feel that it's that's what I wanted, so not living with her is producing, ","P1-N400C31":"I guess, positive results. (chuckle) I feel that once she gets really old, I wouldn't want her to live on her own. I'd live with her, but when she's very old and she can't arrange the kitchen or the living room and make it a mess. (laughter) [00:40:16]
THERAPIST: Do you think it's possible that your temperament is not depressed?
CLIENT: I hope so. I really, really hope so. Yeah. I want to bring joy to myself and to other people, and not because I'm so affected by everything Victor said about me, and the thing that he said the most was, "You have this negative streak in you that I cannot deal with," and I just feel like I really ","P1-N400C71":"hope that's not true. What do you mean by that question?
THERAPIST: Now that was a pretty straightforward question.
CLIENT: (laughter) Yes, I do believe.
THERAPIST: What more meaning were you looking for?
CLIENT: I don't know. It's just I already have I just feel like if I'm positive, I can do more good, produce more beauty than when I'm sad, so that means that I'll have more opportunity if I'm temperamentally not depressed. Now I may not be joyous, that's the other extreme, but maybe I can be somewhere ","P1-N400CF1":"in the middle. (chuckle) [00:41:59]
THERAPIST: Cecelia (ph), we're going to need to stop for today, okay.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I will see you on Monday. So Monday is Martin Luther King Day, but I'm here. I work on that day.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I'll be here.
CLIENT: Have a good weekend.
THERAPIST: Thank you. You, too. Take care.
CLIENT: Okay. [00:42:36]
