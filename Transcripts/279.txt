TITLE: Client "S" Therapy Session Audio Recording, May 20, 2013: Client discusses the transactional nature of her relationship with her boyfriend.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the transactional nature of her relationship with her boyfriend.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.
CLIENT: It's really weird to just come in and start talking. (chuckle) (pause) Did you have a nice weekend? [00:02:45]
THERAPIST: Yes, thank you.
CLIENT: I was quite busy with work, and then, let's see, I took a little break on Saturday, and I went to get shoes or Chris bought me shoes for my birthday. And so when we were walking back, and he was just like I guess it's tiring for men to sit around and women shop for shoes. (chuckle) So I ","P1-N400111":"mean and he usually always preoccupied, so, you know, whatever, and it's just yeah, I guess I am used to it. [00:04:35]
THERAPIST: Why death?
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: Why death?
CLIENT: I don't know. I guess I was in this thing or some way weird reason, Victor, and I haven't heard from him in a very long time, maybe it's just that I mean, I know what you are saying, you know, he's part of the narrative, and all that. I see that, but I guess I was feeling hurt that, you ","P1-N4001F1":"know, he's continuing on with his life, and, you know, I'm not a part of it, and even just thinking about the stuff that happened, and thinking he wasn't very nice, and, you know, maybe thinking he shouldn't have done some of the things he did, you know. So, I don't know. [00:08:51]
THERAPIST: It doesn't seem like you don't want to marry Chris because you're worried about being too happy.
CLIENT: (chuckle) Yeah. But I don't know. Maybe I am, and I'm really scared of it. I don't know. It's like he's nice, and he loves me, and -
THERAPIST: The way you describe your relationship, it sounds so depressing.
CLIENT: Yeah?
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:11:24]
CLIENT: Well, we have our good moments. Like, we listen to music, and this weekend, we were just doing, you know, the festival, and, you know, it was letting you know about jazz. Yeah, like, he knows so much I mean, we have disagreements. Like yesterday, so this man in the community who knows pretty ","P1-N4002F1":"much everyone. He had gone away, and he came back, so we went to see him, and we don't go to see him specifically, but someone else was going away, so this man was there. And, you know, Chris, you know, he was talking to them and telling all these stories. And I'm a little afraid of this man just because ","P1-N4002F2":"I have problem with older men who are in position of authority, and it's completely, like, and back goes up, like, no, no, no, I don't want to stay with you, la, la, la. Just get on your belly, I said, you know, which is very bad for me (chuckle) because, you know, I do want to learn. [00:12:34]
THERAPIST: I was thinking about your description at the beginning of this session was relationships as transactional.
CLIENT: Yeah. What about it? (chuckle)
THERAPIST: It's very bleak.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It sounds like prostitution. [00:18:05]
CLIENT: (chuckle) That's what it feels like. I mean, I have deep respect for sex workers. (laughter) But that doesn't mean that I don't feel the cultural stigma in their profession. No, I mean that's what I remember, you know, and I can see, you know, that's what really stung me. And it was just one ","P1-N400451":"moment when you are and people really mean it, but it's, kind of, it became Chris after the shoe shopping, at which during which he was, you know, so like, "Okay, just tell me wherever, and I can give you my credit card or something." (chuckle) You know. It wasn't like, hey, you're a person, and, you ","P1-N400452":"know, it's your birthday, and here is this gift for you because I like you," you know. [00:19:24]
THERAPIST: Well, but you treat him in a transactional fashion, so how is he supposed to treat you differently?
CLIENT: What do you mean I treat him as -
THERAPIST: Well, you want to stay with him because you need food and shelter. When you think about leaving him, sometimes you think about some of the things the two of you have in common, but you primarily think, well, you know, I need him for Nepal because I don't have anywhere else to stay.
CLIENT: No, I don't think of it completely like that.
THERAPIST: I know. I know it's not completely like that, but you do think of him that way, especially when it's come to moving recently. Primary reason you give for not breaking up with him is because, you know, he gives you food and you have somewhere to live. [00:20:09]
CLIENT: Yeah. No, I mean the living thing is definitely there. I mean, I could live with my mom, but it's just, you know, it's better for me to live at Chris's place because it's, kind of, more central, and also it's not with my mom. And you know living with my mom can is its own, can't afford my ","P1-N400511":"mom. Like she's not very clean, and all that, so I see a lot of time being wasted trying to fight with her, or go against her nature, or make her clean up, you know, and worry about her constantly. So at least for right now, and I mean, yeah, I mean I guess I don't know what you're trying to say. I ","P1-N400512":"get her to say it because if I do it, then it's okay? (chuckle) [00:21:08]
THERAPIST: No, I'm not saying it's okay, but it upsets that he's doing it, that you're treating him like that.
CLIENT: I don't know. I mean, I'm not saying I can't be hypocritical. I'm sure I am one, but -
THERAPIST: Well, it may be hypocritical, but I actually wasn't focusing on that. I was thinking that if you set up the relationship that way, it's hard for him to have a different kind of relationship with you. I mean, he understands that there's a way in which you're transactional with him, so I mean, ","P1-N400571":"you know, how is he supposed to treat you differently?
CLIENT: I don't know. I mean, I don't know what to say to that. (chuckle)
THERAPIST: I mean, over time, it's going to affect the way he looks at you and treats you, you know, that's what I'm saying. I'm not saying you're being hypocritical, per se, I'm just saying this is the situation that you've definitely helped create. [00:22:17]
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know if I helped create it or if it's just there. I mean, I feel like for five years when he wasn't working, you know, I didn't bug him at all for rent.
THERAPIST: Right, and I know that. I know that he has borrowed money from you, or I don't know if the understanding is borrowed it, but it's not clear that he stayed with you because of that, but that was one of the reasons he stayed with you. Now you may feel that's true, but, sort of, getting a rent-free ","P1-N4005F1":"apartment, or, you know, that doesn't necessarily mean that was his motivation.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, for me, motivation, or maybe it was equal, the not having to pay rent was actually in the environment, like living at Arlington.
THERAPIST: Exactly.
CLIENT: What?
THERAPIST: In terms of with him?
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, he and I have so many conversations that I appreciate, and it's a much smaller place, and I don't know, I feel like I can get my bearings more in this place. It's hard to explain, but I feel like my head space is far more contained, and, you know, but yeah. And I feel more taken ","P1-N400691":"care of, not probably because he pays the rent, but, you know, it's like preparing a meal, eating together, you know. That has a lot of meaning, you know, the daily living creates me, you know, for me whereas living by myself\/occasionally seeing Chris or too when I'm in the kitchen. [00:24:12]
THERAPIST: What did you do?
CLIENT: I don't know. The only meals I remember are when, you know, my dad and after a huge fight he would go and his way of saying sorry would be to get some street food, like really, really delicious, like a chicken curry or something. And, you know, I guess and my mom would pull out the bread ","P1-N4006F1":"that she had made the previous day. It was, you know, stale and it was hard to eat, but, you know, we didn't care about that. It's just the curry, it was so good, and I'd just eat it with my books, and all my books had curry stains on them. (chuckle)
THERAPIST: What were your thoughts about asking me how my weekend was?
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: Well, usually we don't talk about how my life is going.
CLIENT: No, I do. I ask about your weekend every time, every Monday.
THERAPIST: Do you?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Hm. Maybe it was more pronounced today because you didn't know what you started by saying this is so weird to sit down, and then you asked me, but you weren't talking.
CLIENT: Yeah, I know. It's just sometimes it's like, this is so weird, like sitting down and just start button and start talking my problems. To me, it's just very weird. It's unnatural, you know, because we're not friends or anything, so to me, it's comforting to talk about problems with friends because ","P1-N400831":"it's mutual and it's not like, "Well, you know, you're full of problems, but I'm not," or you know, any yeah, so I don't know. So [00:29:56]
THERAPIST: So it's a power thing again?
CLIENT: I guess. Or transactional.
THERAPIST: Well, transactional relationships are one without a personal connection or any caring. It's like you give me this, I'll give you that.
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess Chris and I do care about each. I mean right?
THERAPIST: You're not sure?
CLIENT: No, I mean, you know, if you say that, you know, it's transactional, but I don't know. I guess I should get over those moments when it becomes transactional, but those moments weigh so heavily on, you know, they cast such a dark cloud on the rest of the relationship, I guess. That really depresses ","P1-N4008F1":"me, just debilitates me, and I'm just like, you know, I don't want to do it.
