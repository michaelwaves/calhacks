DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her frustration about how long it's taking her stomach issues to heal. Client discusses her ability to sabotage her current relationship because of her lack of patience.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in. I'm just getting [unclear].
CLIENT: But actually I have to dip out a bit early today, I have a meeting at 4:20. But I wanted to come and chat with you, check in.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So this is what I got from the insurance, which just said to endorse it to you on the back. Is that okay?
THERAPIST: Sure. Yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: Okay. Then I was thinking I left my checkbook at home, so can I mail you-
THERAPIST: Yeah, that's fine.
CLIENT: -the check for November-
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: -since we're going away next week?
THERAPIST: Yeah, no worries.
CLIENT: Okay. So yeah, I wanted to chat a little bit just about like the billing and insurance and stuff, because I don't-I mean, in no way possible was I expecting you to say don't worry about the-you know, the outstanding balance and stuff like that. I appreciate it a lot. But I don't know if you-I ","P1-N400211":"don't know. I just wanted to chat a little bit about whether this was like something that you were actually anticipating, or-because I'm happy to-I mean, if you would like refer to somebody that was in the-like the insurance network, and I would be happy to find something that was more affordable that ","P1-N400212":"didn't take up your time and result in you not really getting your full cost and everything.
THERAPIST: Well, yeah, a couple of those. I mean, I have a sense of what the insurance reimburses.
CLIENT: I know.
THERAPIST: That's why, you know, with the audio recording, which does pay-reimburse-
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: -and your co-pay, and what they pay. The reason that this is a little bit less is because part of it went to your deductible.
CLIENT: Right. I did speak to the woman at length about that. I still have no idea what goes where, so. [laughs]
THERAPIST: Yeah. But yeah, no, I knew this-
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: -or I had a sense of it. It seems like you're acting, you know, like you want to make sure it's okay.
CLIENT: Yeah, because I didn't-you know, because originally I remember being like, "Oh, I should really call that and double check what they're going to cover." But I don't know, I didn't because-well, you were like, "They'll cover it." So but I really-I wasn't expecting it to be such a discrepancy. ","P1-N400351":"So I just-yeah, I want-I didn't know if it was something, because we hadn't talked about it yet, so I didn't know if it was actually what you were anticipating. But if that's fine with you, like that-then that's fine with me. But, you know, I just[3:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, first of all, between all of those things it's not that much different-
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: -than my full fee. And also I really do like working with grad students.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: I think that people should get, you know, treatment, and I like to offer that to people who can't afford my full fee.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And so I want to make it possible. So those two things both are important to me.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I appreciate it a lot. Thank you. So I guess if that's the case then each month going forward is that that $40 co-pay-
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: -and will it just be what I owe and whatever they send they send?
THERAPIST: Yeah. Yup.
CLIENT: Okay. All right, well thank you, I appreciate it. You know, I was like kind of feeling-I mean I felt guilty because I was like-I had had that thought, like you should really just check with the insurance company, but I just-I didn't, so. But all right. Well, I just wanted to like clear that a little bit.
THERAPIST: Yeah. And it seems like you got really worried.
CLIENT: It wasn't like wor-I mean, in the moment I was-had like a moment of panic, because I was thinking, crap, I don't have like $800. I mean, like I do, but it's my-like what I've been saving from working that I was hoping to buy something with. [laughter] And I was like, "Oh no!" So I had like a ","P1-N400511":"moment of like, "Oh god, what do I do?" And I didn't want to have to ask my parents to help me out, because I know that they would have. But I was like, this whole process, I made it a point to like seek out something that I felt was affordable for me, so that I felt like I was doing this on my own ","P1-N400512":"and not having to ask my parents for help. Because I know that they would-and they offer it all the time.
THERAPIST: It almost seems like you feel you're by yourself. Like this is like all-
CLIENT: Not-no. I mean, I know-like I know that I'm not by myself when it comes to this kind of-I mean, in a way like I do feel like isolated and lonely sometimes with my anxiety, that nobody really understands, or like I don't feel like I can talk to the people about it. But as far as like the money ","P1-N400571":"is concerned I just wanted-I don't know. Like since I've got back from Egypt I've just been trying to do as much independently as possible because I don't want to-I don't think I'm doing-I think it's a disservice to me to be constantly relying on my parents for everything. Because like I'm 28 years ","P1-N400572":"old now, and I'm still a student, so we have like an agreement that, you know, they're going to provide support as needed, and like I don't have to pay my phone bill, and I don't have to pay my car insurance for now because I'm still in school and I'm like living off of loans. You know, my mom sees ","P1-N400573":"it like, well, it's not really-I'm like, "Oh, I have so much money now," and she's like, "It's not really your money because you have to give it back."
THERAPIST: But even with me, I mean, I sort of-even if I anticipate the difference or whatever.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: You know, I sent to you, I do forty-you know, $40, and offer you $40 co-pay.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.
THERAPIST: So it would be on me too, it's not just your burden. I mean, that's what I-
CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. I didn't think about that.
THERAPIST: It would be a part-you know, even if we had to negotiate something different going ahead-
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: -I mean, I would keep my word regardless. [8:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. And I appreciate that. I just-yeah, I guess-I mean, this is literally the first time I've-you know, this is the first insurance plan that I've had, because I was covered under my dad's insurance until I turned 26. And so this is like the first time I've had my own health insurance. And, ","P1-N4006F1":"I mean, it's like-I don't know. It feels nice that I like pay for stuff. And I know it's like federal loan money, you know, but it feels nice when I like manage my-with the money that they've given me and I like manage it. And, you know, like I pay-for all of my doctors' expenses that I've had with ","P1-N4006F2":"my stomach like I've paid the co-pays, I get the bills and I pay the bills, and I pay for my prescriptions, you know. And it like makes me-it doesn't make you feel nice because I'm sick, but it's like it makes me feel independent, and like I'm taking steps towards becoming a more functional adult. So ","P1-N4006F3":"I like-you know, I'm not just-like I like being able to pay those things on my own. So. [9:00]
THERAPIST: Well, you'll continue to be able to do so in the therapy.
CLIENT: Well, I appreciate it.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: But so I wanted to ask you, because this like got me thinking, because there was like for however many days or hours that I was like, well maybe I-like, you know, if-like maybe I should ask Dr. Rodgers to refer me to someone that's more affordable or whatnot. But so then I just started thinking ","P1-N400771":"about like my therapy in general and was kind of wondering like where-I don't know, like where you see me like going. Because we haven't-I mean, like I know I come here and talk, but I haven't done therapy like this before where I just talk, I'm used to someone likeWhich isn't a bad thing, it's just ","P1-N400772":"new for me. I'm used to someone like telling me things and giving me like things to do, you know. I guess more like behavioral therapy I guess. But so I was just wondering, it got me thinking, like I wonder what you think about my situation in life, where you see it going, or like[10:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm happy to answer that piece. But in terms of-I mean, there are actually just different kinds of therapy.
CLIENT: No, exactly, yeah.
THERAPIST: But it sounds like in a way also-it's not really like developmentally now you've sort of graduated to this kind of therapy.
CLIENT: No. No, yeah.
THERAPIST: But when I think about out it it's sort of like this therapy feels like you have more autonomy. You know, it's less like directive, you know, in that sense. [laughs]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like it kind of parallels what you're feeling in your life.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. I guess it makes me-and it's probably like a good thing for-because I need to get better at feeling like more uncertain about things and not freaking out about it. But I just like always leave here wondering like what you're thinking and whether I am like-how do I know ","P1-N400871":"if I'm like making any progress, or-because I can't tell.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: You know.
THERAPIST: Well, certainly it's hard to mark that week by week for sure.
CLIENT: No, yeah, and it hasn't been very long. [11:00]
THERAPIST: Mm hm. But I will say-I mean, you're dealing with a whole lot of anxiety that gets expressed in all different ways.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: It gets very focused on your body as we know at times. What it means and sort of how this will unfold I don't know.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I feel like that's what we're trying to like unwrap, for a lack of a better term. I mean, clearly I think there's a lot that we can do and that we're beginning to do to begin to kind of help-I don't if unravel's really the right word, but there's a lot of layers to it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it's pretty profound, and it really does pretty negatively impact your life in particular areas. And in many ways you're thriving, but it really is like a lead.
CLIENT: Yeah. No, I do feel like it's like just this like one thing that kind of holds me back from really getting at my like full potential of everything in life.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: So, I mean, do we-and I hate to like make this goal oriented, because maybe that's not the point, but is the goal I guess for lack of a better word to like get to the root of what's causing me to feel this way? Or to gain more of an understanding of why and then through that-is that how I like ","P1-N400A31":"start to deal with it? Or...
THERAPIST: I mean, definitely the latter. Like certainly getting more of an understanding, which I think we've certainly been starting to do.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: And it's like part of it is about the feelings that you have about yourself and your own confidence in yourself. Your abilities and the ways you feel that you've relied on your parents sort of sometimes almost to the detriment-you feel to the detriment of developing. I mean, not necessarily ","P1-N400A91":"when you were a kid, when you're a kid people rely on their parents, so.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: But in terms of getting to the root of it, I usually don't think about it in that respect because it seems so specific, the root of it.
CLIENT: Mm hm, right.
THERAPIST: Because I think there's sort of just a lot of influences.
CLIENT: Mm hm. [13:00]
THERAPIST: But I mean, even in your response, like our e-mail exchange, that-just that anxiety was so palpable.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like it's not going to be-like we better do something, but what's going to happen, [inarticulate sounds of anxiety].
CLIENT: Yeah, I know. That was always-I'm supposed to like show her e-mails I send about important things before I send them, because she calls it like my-she's nice about it, and she says like my Chicagoness comes out. But I've gotten into trouble before because I've been like-either I've been like ","P1-N400BB1":"too hasty, or very direct, or-and I think I'm coming off like very friendly and calm but it's not. We got like the-we're now very close friends with our downstairs neighbor, but when we first moved in and I started noticing for a while that like the door-like you needed to-the door to our like I guess-like ","P1-N400BB2":"we live in like a brownstone with like different sections of the building, it was like the door to our section of the building, if you didn't really shut it then it didn't close.
THERAPIST: Certainly your e-mail did not seem unfriendly to me.
CLIENT: No, not unfriendly. But I think it's like-I guess hasteful is the right-or I don't know. Tense.
THERAPIST: Yeah, you're just anxious.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it's sort of like you need to figure something out very quickly.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: And even we can't even wait till our next session, we have to figure it out in an e-mail before our session. [16:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I mean, I was a little bit concerned. I was like if I-I was concerned if I was going to need to pay that much money, I was like, "I can't afford another session." But yeah, no. I mean, it's very-you know, my mom and I have been joking around about me finding patience and where I ","P1-N400D11":"can get some patience from. Especially with my stomach situation. Because so-I mean, I got good news on Monday that all the biopsies came back normal, and so there's nothing-you know, the ulcer's healed and all that's-the inflammation they found last week was what they called mild residual gastritis. ","P1-N400D12":"Which basically means everything's great, and everything's getting better. But they want me to wait-still be on this diet and taking the meds for another three to four months before I can like start tapering back my meds. So I got upset about it, you know, because I just like want this to be over. And ","P1-N400D13":"so we've been talking about how I can find some patience.
THERAPIST: Mm hm. [17:00]
CLIENT: But that's definitely-I'm very-I get very tense and I need to know things, I need to have things resolved quickly. And that comes out in every aspect of my life. And it's usually things that like after the fact kind of turn into like jokes, you know. But I think it's like definitely kind of ","P1-N400D51":"an issue that I do this all the time. I mean, when Amelia and I were dating, first started dating, and it was about a month-so probably like four months into our relationship, and about a month before we were closing our service in Egypt, and I was, you know, realizing that I'm falling in love with ","P1-N400D52":"her and that I want to try to transplant our relationship back to the States. And it was during a time when we were all applying to graduate schools and kind of looking at what our next options were once we moved back to the United States. And I decided one day that that's a conversation I want to have ","P1-N400D53":"with Amelia, and I want to talk to her about looking at schools in same cities, and making conscious decisions so that we can try to move to the same city. And then, you know, the conversation about moving in together after the same city happened, like you know, kind of naturally happened after that. [18:15]
THERAPIST: Is anyone else in your family like that?
CLIENT: My dad.
THERAPIST: Your dad, uh huh.
CLIENT: And my brother.
THERAPIST: He's got like, "No, right away." Or they both have to like do something right away.
CLIENT: My dad more so than my brother, yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Yeah. My dad and I are very similar, I'm finding out more and more.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: Now that I'm open with him and my mom more about like my anxiety issues I'm finding out how similar we are. And just spending time-like now that I've been paying attention to the way that like my anxiety manifests itself, and when I spend time with my parents I can now see that it comes out ","P1-N400ED1":"in very similar ways.
THERAPIST: As your dad. [20:15]
CLIENT: Oh yeah. Like we are very, very cranky and passive aggressive a little bit, because like we know that-we know what's wrong, but like we're still upset about it and so-but like, I don't know, like he takes it out on my mom a little bit, I take it out on Amelia a little bit. Just kind of like ","P1-N400F11":"walking around the house and cleaning, vacuuming, that's like our release. So Amelia was laughing when we were home for Thanksgiving, because he was just like vacuuming the whole time. She was like, "I see where you get it." [laughs] So yeah.
THERAPIST: Were you around him a lot growing up? Was he around a lot?
CLIENT: You know, like both my parents were around relatively equally. Maybe my dad a little bit more than my mom. But they both worked full time, and it wasn't-I don't look back on childhood and feel like I spent more time with one versus the other. Like we always did stuff as a family. I think I was ","P1-N400F51":"around my au pairs most of the time, and my babysitters most of the time. But... Yeah, I don't think I was around him any more than I was around anyone else, but...
THERAPIST: Yeah, I was just more curious about just-
CLIENT: If I picked that up from-
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Exposure. I mean, there's sort of the genetic element.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But just the exposure element.
CLIENT: I'm sure I would have like noticed it growing up I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, he's always just gotten-like he gets very intense about things, in the same way that I do.
THERAPIST: It has this sort of like-I think about eating disorder, it has a sort of purge-esque quality to it, like you've got to get it out. [22:00]
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: You can't keep it down.
CLIENT: Mm hm. Which is interesting, because as much as I've struggled with eating, it's never been something that I've been able to or had a desire to do.
THERAPIST: Yeah, it's something that you mentioned.
CLIENT: Yeah, no, that's like-you know, I definitely would-yeah, I just-I remember trying once, but I just like-it was just likeAnd I had the thought of like maybe I should try it, but then I was like, "Oh, no, I'm not going to try that." Like it was just never something that interested me. Never ","P1-N401111":"something that I felt like I had to do either, I didn't feel compelled to do that. And I really hate throwing up actually. Like even if I feel nauseous, I will try my best not to just like not throw up. So yeah, I never had that issue. [pause] Because like as much anxiety as I have about things going ","P1-N401112":"in, once it's in and nothing bad happens in like five or ten minutes, then I'm like, okay, I'm all right, I can have some more of it now, you know. So. Like I just discovered that I can eat-like Greek yogurt doesn't make me die. So I've been like really enjoying myself now at dinner, or like whatever ","P1-N401113":"meals I have yogurt with. I haven't had yogurt in a long time, so. [23:30]
THERAPIST: What was the concern originally about Greek yogurt?
CLIENT: I had had-it was because I had gotten really sick off a different type of yogurt, it was like a Danon Light and Fit or something that's like very processed and lots of chemicals, and that had given me really bad symptoms when I first got sick. So kind of like-you know when you get sick from ","P1-N401151":"something you don't really want to eat it anymore anyway. But so like after that had kind of passed away though, or like gone away, like I didn't have that like "oo" feeling when I thought about yogurt, I was still like nervous about any kind of yogurt. And we made like [botkas? 24:02] for the holiday ","P1-N401152":"and I was like, "I'll just try a little bit," you know, instead of sour cream on it, and nothing happened, so. [long pause] What are you thinking?
THERAPIST: I was just thinking about-sort of thinking about how to put words to your anxiety, and just this-it seems like this overwhelming feeling like feeling that everything's going to be okay.
CLIENT: Yeah. When I went to therapy after I got back from Egypt I remember telling her that felt like I was just like waiting for something bad to happen. Oh yeah, I told you this. And she said I had [unclear 25:10] syndrome, because I was just like life was soAnd I still feel that way, like I feel ","P1-N401191":"like everything's so good that like I'm just like waiting for something to go wrong, you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah, but it's like your insides are not matching the outside.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because there's this gnawing sense that things will go very awry, and so it's not-there's no correspondence.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It's like at least if it-I mean, obviously you want things to go well, but if things were not going well at least there would be some symmetry or something-
CLIENT: Mm hm. I know, it's frustrating. I should be like-I should stressed because of school, you know, and because I'm about to graduate my Master's degree in a job market where I have people with Master's degree applying for my position, you know. And I should be stressed about getting a job, and ","P1-N401251":"I should be stressed about finishing my thesis and doing well. But like I don't get stressed about those things. You know what I mean? And it's like I just want to be stressed about like the regular stuff, you know. [pause]
THERAPIST: Well, it seems like when you get particular ideas in your mind they don't let up, they kind of just flash in there-
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: -and put their hooks in. [26:45]
CLIENT: Yeah. [pause] Yeah. I feel like I've always been like that. Like when my mom talks about how I was growing up, and I was like a teenager and stuff, she's like-she'll say that there was no like talking me out of something. Like I got something-like an idea in my mind, and like I wanted to do ","P1-N4012D1":"something, and like there was no talking me out of it, you know. Like she'll tell the story of when I went abroad to Madagascar for the first time, and I was like-I was a baby, I was only 19, you know, and I had never been out of the country before by myself. I had been as far as New Hampshire for sleep ","P1-N4012D2":"away camp, but like I had never been overnight or anything like that. I mean, I was in college in Indiana but. And I just called her up and said, "I'm going to do this program." I mean, it wasn't like, "Hey, what do you think about me doing this program," it was just like, "I'm gonna sign up for this ","P1-N4012D3":"and I'm going to go to Madagascar."
THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, once you get an anxious thought in your head there's no talking you out of it.
CLIENT: Right. Until someone who's like very qualified in whatever I'm anxious about can tell me, you know. Like if I'm anxious about my stomach, if the doctor calls and tells me like, "You're healed," you know, then I'll believe her. But like if Amelia tells me, "You're fine," I don't believe her, you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I was thinking in terms of this diet. I mean, in some ways it makes sense, but there's a way in which you go to like this extremely literal-
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: -interpretation of things, like as literal as possible.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: And you clearly have a sort of metaphoric creative mind.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: You can get very, very literal.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure-you know, like right now I'm waiting for this physician's assistant who I've been working with to call me to talk about the letter-because I was like seeing a physician's assistant, but she can't perform the endoscopy, so I was getting the tests done by this doctor, and ","P1-N401471":"so then the doctor was giving me the instructions. But they send you these letters in the mail with like no information on them. It just says like, "Hey, it was great to see you. And congratulations, your ulcer's healed, but there's just some mild gastritis. So come talk to me in four months about stepping ","P1-N401472":"down your medication." But I'm like, that doesn't-you know, I would like to like ask them questions and be like, well, if it took the ulcer only two months to heal why is it going to take this mild inflammation four months to heal? You know. But so I usually like then will call the physician's assistant ","P1-N401473":"who will explain to me everything. [31:30]
THERAPIST: Okay. That's not a small problem.
CLIENT: I know.
THERAPIST: It makes me think about the door and issues around security.
CLIENT: Mm hm. Oh yeah. Yeah. Like I like being able to feel in a sense and know for certainty that everything is like safe and okay, you know. Like I don't want to start eating things that might bring the ulcer back, you know what I mean? Because there's still-like that's what happens, it starts out ","P1-N401511":"as gastritis and then turns into an ulcer. So like I want to make sure-you know what I mean? But like without someone telling me definitively that it won't change the healing properties, you know. If you want to have like one beer, you know what I mean, take a Pepcid and then have your beer, or something ","P1-N401512":"like that. If it doesn't hurt you then it's not-you know. But I like to like know for certain before I like will do anything.
THERAPIST: [unclear]
CLIENT: Yeah, I'm gonna leave. I'll be a little bit late but... I found out about this call like a couple days ago, but I was-like wanted to come in anyway for the majority of the time, so.
THERAPIST: And you're gone now the next two Thursdays. Is that one Thursday or two Thursdays?
CLIENT: I think it's two Thursdays. Well, Christmas Eve is-I mean, the day after Christmas is a Thursday, right?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. And so we fly-we're like on a red eye that night, so we don't get in until Friday. So I won't see you until the first Thursday in January.
THERAPIST: Which is I think the 2nd. I think January-it's the day after Thanks-uh, the day after Thanksgiving-the day after New Years.
CLIENT: So are you seeing people that day?
THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, I'll be-
CLIENT: Okay. We'll be here.
THERAPIST: Yeah. No, I'm just not here that Wednesday, but I'll be the rest of the time.
CLIENT: Okay. I don't think I have the day off work, so. Even if I did, I'm just down the street. Okay, so we'll just plan on that.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: And I don't know, does anything change like once the new year changes over with your schedule? Or is this time still good? [35:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah, this time's still good.
CLIENT: Oh, actually, this time might not beSo I'm going back to school on the 15th.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So for the day after New Years I would still be at [unclear 35:13], but I don't have my class schedule yet.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So I should have that by the time I come in-
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: -in January. And then we can talk about whether this still works or whether we need [unclear].
THERAPIST: Okay. Well, hopefully [unclear].
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, I have to see. They don't let us register until the week of class [unclear]. So I'll take a look at that.
THERAPIST: Well, I hope you have a good vacation.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: And a happy New Year.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know-if you're going anywhere have fun, or even if you're not.
THERAPIST: Thank you so much.
CLIENT: Enjoy the holidays.
THERAPIST: Okay. I'll see you.
CLIENT: And thanks again, I really appreciate it.
THERAPIST: Oh sure.
CLIENT: I don't want to break up. [laughter]
