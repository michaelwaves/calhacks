DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the therapist's pregnancy and feeling uncomfortable in asking too many personal questions. Client discusses his stressful week and a visit from his father-in-law.
THERAPIST: Hi! Come on in!
CLIENT: Good morning.
THERAPIST: Morning!
CLIENT: Did you know you were pregnant when you got engaged?
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: What brought that question to mind? Is it something you’d been thinking about?
CLIENT: Yeah, so, so... I’m very happy for you. I left and I was thinking about it. It occurred to me that I hadn’t asked my usual question of like, “Was this intentional?” But... the timing was different from how some people... order their lives. So... it occurred to me that... ","P1-N4001B1":"that this might have been an experience that was not... planned and... as a result, might have involved some suffering, on your part. So... [00:02:01]
THERAPIST: Hmm! How?
CLIENT: (pause) Well, remembering that I know nothing about your relationship, one could imagine that you... would have a decision to make... and that that would not be an easy one. (pause) So I... you know, I can count okay, so... I was pretty sure of the answer to the question before I asked it, but ","P1-N4001F1":"I thought it was important to talk about, because it seemed like, it seemed like it says a lot about me. I was also interested in you, and wanted to express my interest in your life and... You know, I think it (chuckles) it says a lot that my initial response was just like, very positive, because that’s ","P1-N4001F2":"not always my initial response. I also tend to ascribe to you, I think, the highest possible intentionality. So... Not that it’s troubling for me in any way if you like, are not the ideal person. Just that like, as a default assumption, you get the ideal values. So... [00:03:36]
THERAPIST: And how would this be less than ideal?
CLIENT: Um, I... (chuckles) (pause)
THERAPIST: I’m... I’m seriously trying to just follow how you’re thinking.
CLIENT: Well, so, so the... (pause) In the abstract sense (not talking specifically about your relationship), often pregnancies that then result in engagements were not planned. That... situation leads to choices that people may or may not have made otherwise. So...
THERAPIST: Not at my age! (client affirms) Pregnancies do not happen at my age! (chuckles)
CLIENT: Okay. (pause) Well, again, congratulations! [00:04:47]
THERAPIST: Thank you. (pause) So you’re thinking people don’t try to get pregnant if they’re not married.
CLIENT: Um... (chuckles) Many people don’t try to get pregnant if they’re not married. Again, that doesn’t say anything about... your specific circumstances, I think, so...
THERAPIST: Maybe. I’m not sure that, but... okay.
CLIENT: Well, so there is this sort of like a distribution of behaviors in the world, right? So, knowing that, knowing the sequence of events doesn’t tell me anything about... other than you fall in some distribution of behavior, but you could fall at either tail, so... It’s less likely, ","P1-N400331":"but that doesn’t... I also have no idea how old you are, so I (chuckles)... Your response is an amusing one, in some ways. [00:05:55]
THERAPIST: How so?
CLIENT: Well, it’s just like that, but... I know you’re older than I am, but I... That’s like... That doesn’t bound things very much. I know you’re not 80, so...
THERAPIST: But it sounds like... the thought process was, your immediate response was congratulations, you were very happy. And then you thought about it after, and tried to sort of fit these timelines into things that felt familiar to you, that you know, and then started to kind of wonder, maybe even ","P1-N400391":"worry a little bit.
CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Yeah, that’s almost exactly right.
THERAPIST: Which could be true, whether I were married first or not.
CLIENT: Absolutely, absolutely. But (chuckles), but again, I sort of ascribe to you very high intentionality, so it’s sort of like, that, not that... Yeah. So I think it was sort of a recognition that my implicit assumptions were not necessarily valid, that I wasn’t even aware of them. That ","P1-N400431":"was the... so... [00:10:12]
THERAPIST: But then just the different set of implicit assumptions just kicked in.
CLIENT: Um... (sighs) No. They’re much more explicit at that point.
THERAPIST: A different set of assumptions?
CLIENT: Yeah, but I was aware of them, and as a result, aware that they had no (chuckles) particular... I try to be very careful in phrasing this, because like, I really don’t know anything about, other than, like... So...
THERAPIST: Well, it seems like it’s sort of, this is about what it’s like, operating with not a lot of information. You know, trying to fill in what things could mean for me.
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that’s true, too. Yeah, absolutely. You know, on the other hand, there is a wealth of information here, you know. It explains why you’ve stopped drinking coffee, so... But yes, I think that is right.
THERAPIST: Well, not really. (client affirms) What was your concern in terms of that? Like, how would I feel uncomfortable?
CLIENT: Um... (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Because the questions are personal?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, we’re talking about a very personal set of questions. (pause) And also, I have been uncomfortable in talking about it and so I... I think I have, as a result, wondered whether you might be uncomfortable also. Mostly, I think because I’m uncomfortable, because I’m ","P1-N4005B1":"worried that I’m going to like... It doesn’t make sense, or that I’m going to run into something that will upset you. (pause) Which doesn’t make a lot of sense, because I, I actually trust you to be able to deal with your emotions like, I really do. So... (pause) Again, I think ","P1-N4005B2":"that says a lot about where I am, at present.
THERAPIST: I was thinking that, when you refer to the minister, who married you and Tanya, that that first question you asked was whether it was planned.
CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. (pause) Yes. It didn’t even occur to me that, when you told me you were pregnant, so...
THERAPIST: Thank you.
CLIENT: And, so you know, assuming that this is what you wanted, I just thought you must be happy, and so I was also very happy for you. I think there is also like... (pause) I certainly think I have a desire for children, in a general sense. Here is this thing that I want and you have that is, and ","P1-N400691":"that’s great! I want you to have good things, so...
THERAPIST: (pause) Well, and I was thinking in terms of comparing me to your sister. She is someone who, at least from what you last said, is in not a good situation, in some ways. [00:18:39]
CLIENT: Yeah (chuckles), that’s definitely true. (pause) Somehow, that doesn’t seem particularly important to me, in this context, but maybe it is important and I just don’t... recognize it as such. (pause) I mean, you’re very different people, but also like, the particular trouble ","P1-N4006D1":"she is in is that she’s getting divorced while pregnant, not that she’s getting engaged or married while she was pregnant, so...
THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?
CLIENT: I’m sort of thinking about... I wasn’t really sure where else to go on this topic. You had sort of... you had mentioned reasoning in the face of not having very much information. You know, certainly you’ve seen some elements of how I reasoned without very much information, ","P1-N400731":"which is a situation I’m often in, professionally. It’s just, what we do is we collect data and then try to figure out what the next thing to collect is, and what might be going on, and so forth, so... [00:22:22]
THERAPIST: Does my being pregnant make you think more about your wish for children? You had mentioned that.
CLIENT: (chuckles) I am not actually sure how to answer that. Yes? No? (chuckles) I have thought about it, as a result... But I think about it occasionally, anyway. And I might otherwise have thought about it in the context of Tanya being acutely unwell, because... it really does not seem like... (pause) ","P1-N400811":"It does not seem like that’s a desire that will be fulfilled in the near term. Or something like that. (pause) So, in response to your sort of causal question, I have no idea, but...
THERAPIST: “For me is very weird,” meaning that you think it’s strange that they did that, or... for you that...
CLIENT: Yeah. It was just a strange thing to do. “Oh, you’re dog sitting for someone. Well, we’ll just come stay with you in someone else’s house,” like... Tanya’s immediate response was, “Well, I have to ask the person whose house it is whether that’s ","P1-N4008B1":"okay, but, yeah, I guess we can do that.” So it was okay with... that person, but, still just, for me, a very strange thing. I see it as equivalent to inviting yourself to someone’s house that you don’t know. At least the way I was raised, there were some social norms against doing ","P1-N4008B2":"that sort of thing, but I was raised in a weird place, so... who knows?
THERAPIST: Because if she did, she would be less likely to have him come?
CLIENT: Yeah! Yeah! (chuckles) If she had been able to... get... like, a quarter of... what it was going to be like, in her head, when she was replying to that e-mail, she would have said, “Why don’t you come in a month or something. Or never.” But I actually think it’s good ","P1-N400951":"that he did come visit. I think that’s a good thing. I think it was poorly timed, and poorly planned, and caused a lot of stress, and it didn’t relieve a lot of stress. So that seems like the opposite of the point, when you’re trying to visit your daughter, who just got out of the ","P1-N400952":"hospital for mental illness. So... (pause) But ultimately, it comes down to he needed to see her. That’s why he came up. He needed to feel like he was taking care of her. [00:35:22]
THERAPIST: Are you annoyed at him?
CLIENT: Was I? (therapist affirms) Or am I?
THERAPIST: Both. (inaudible).
CLIENT: I sure seem like I am, don’t I? (therapist affirms) (pause) Yeah, I think I was. Yeah. But, you know, this is the sort of, this was just (chuckles) how they exist in the world, as a family unit, so like, there is some resignation to that also.
THERAPIST: (pause) Less clear how to deal with it, because it’s so unpleasant.
CLIENT: Yeah, it’s unpleasant. There is nothing really I can do to escape it. I... it’s acute for a long time.
THERAPIST: I was going back to what you started with, in talking about sort of seeing me as someone who is intentional, and then worrying about circumstances being not ideal. I just started thinking about ideal in particular. You know, what it means to deal with not ideal situations and view it like, ","P1-N400B51":"“I feel fine with that.” And how... well, probably, by definition all situations are not ideal, since ideal is not in reality. But I just, yeah, I started to think about that, different circumstances under which people actual (inaudible).
CLIENT: Do you mean me, or the generalized you?
THERAPIST: You... both, I think. (pause) All this, just various friends and so forth going through “not ideal” situations that have turned out really nicely for them. I mean, if the certain parameters were not as they would have set them up. (pause) And so maybe it’s about flexibility, ","P1-N400BD1":"not quite flexibility, but something like that.
CLIENT: So that makes sense, and, you know, I started, had a few hackles raised towards the end of what you were saying, because there is a sort of interpretation in which I could read you as saying like, “Well, you should just be okay with where your life is right now.” (therapist denies) ","P1-N400BF1":"“It will be okay,” which... (chuckles) Thank you for clarifying, but I didn’t really...
THERAPIST: No, I wasn’t saying that at all. [00:45:57]
CLIENT: I didn’t really think that, that you were. I think it’s interesting in the context I was talking about. I can deal with Tanya’s father coming to visit, and her family’s (chuckles) strange circumstances. You know, I bitch about a little bit to you, or to my other more ","P1-N400C31":"intentional friends, but like I can deal with it just fine. I actually like seeing them. But I really don’t know how to deal with this, and...
THERAPIST: Even though I said, I want to, I realize we’ve run out of time (client affirms), but, and I won’t, and of course, I can’t (inaudible) to say, but I definitely did not, that was not what I was thinking about at all.
CLIENT: Thanks.
THERAPIST: But let’s pick this up next week, okay?
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Okay. Take care!
CLIENT: Thanks, you too.
THERAPIST: Okay, thanks.
