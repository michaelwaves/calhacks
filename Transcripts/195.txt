DESCRIPTION: Client discusses a fight she had with her boyfriend and how she feels about this relationship. Client wonders if she is using two men and if she's ready for the commitment that her boyfriend seems ready for.
THERAPIST: Our water still is not working, Cecelia (ph). I don’t think... is it working? Just a few drops. A few drops, so we’re, we’re still (inaudible), dispenser got broken. (inaudible) me out of it, that would be great.
CLIENT: Yeah, just like...
THERAPIST: Okay, great!
THERAPIST: I wanted to let you know. I actually think, from a logistical standpoint, it won’t be a problem, because it probably will coordinate with your time in Nepal, if you go. But I’m actually going to be on maternity leave...
CLIENT: Oh!
THERAPIST: ...for about six weeks over the summer. (client affirms) It will be about the third week in June, and I plan on coming back like, early to mid-August, at least like, two days a week. So, I’ll be back in the office a little bit, and then kind of coming back full-time in September, so...
CLIENT: Okay. Congratulations! (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Thank you, thank you very much. I know you’re usually in Nepal during much of that time, anyway.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don’t know if I’ll go this summer (therapist affirms), but you never know. (chuckles) Yeah. I might go in the winter or something. But yeah, I don’t think that would be a...
THERAPIST: Yeah, I plan to be out of the office for five or six weeks, and then come back about like, you know, two days or something, and then come all the way back. So I’ll certainly be able to see you when I’m back. [00:01:57]
CLIENT: Okay, yeah, no problem. That’s exciting! (chuckles) (pause) Yeah, I don’t know what I’ll be doing this summer.
THERAPIST: No, I’m due the third week in June (client affirms), so I’ll be... I’ll obviously leave then, and then be out, essentially for July, and then be back at some point in August.
CLIENT: Okay. (chuckles) I guess...
THERAPIST: Oh. What, I’m sorry. Which part of it is odd?
CLIENT: No, just, you know, like... yeah. No, it’s not odd, I guess. (chuckles).
THERAPIST: Odd that now it’s your turn?
CLIENT: Yeah, no, I’m just, I just, you know, talk about myself...
THERAPIST: Do you have questions for me?
CLIENT: About what?
THERAPIST: You said, you know, it’s because, well, I’ve told you something about myself (chuckles), you know. Did you have questions about that?
CLIENT: No, I mean, I don’t really, you know, know you, so (chuckles)... I don’t guess, I wouldn’t know what to ask, but...
THERAPIST: You had said that you had read his text and you knew that there was some communication then.
CLIENT: Yeah, so they were having dinner and I was hanging out with my friends and then like, afterwards like, he came to pick me up and stuff. I was, I guess, feeling a little weird (chuckles), you know. And then, I guess, on Friday... like... later that night, I don’t know like... like, I cooked ","P1-N400471":"him dinner and then he was tired, so he fell asleep and then, when he was sleeping, I read more of his texts. Then I was just like, “Okay, they’re like flirting!” You know? [00:06:55]
THERAPIST: What’s great about it?
CLIENT: Well... I don’t know. I guess... There is an immense comfort. I don’t know if that’s the right word. I don’t think it’s... There is discomfort, too. But there is like, this like... leaning that I sort of do, and there is like a humor in it, in the sense that I lean, ","P1-N400671":"and there is no one there but me (chuckles), you know? And my past and my... present and some kind of vague idea of future. So... it’s like, this like temporal me that I get to lean on (chuckles), you know what I mean? And I don’t know. It feels like, solid and not solid at the same time. ","P1-N400672":"I don’t know. I’m having (chuckles) trouble describing it, but it just feels like... I think that’s what it feels like. [00:17:03]
THERAPIST: How do you mean?
CLIENT: Well, it’s not like, when I say, “make my mark” or anything else, it’s not like... you know, I went to outer space or something ridiculous like that. It’s quite, you know, common or... you know, my story or whatever, so...
THERAPIST: I’m sorry, what, the story about what happened over the summer?
CLIENT: Yeah. So... I mean, just because I feel it intensely doesn’t make it like, unique. (chuckles) So...
THERAPIST: Do you feel like you wanted to share something about what could happen in Nepal, or do you feel like you were also trying to share something about yourself?
CLIENT: Yeah... I don’t know. Like, I can’t differentiate between the two. People were like, “Yeah like, introduce yourself and like, if you don’t say what we know about you, we’ll fill in so...” You know, we were doing that for each other. (chuckles) Then I was like... ","P1-N4007F1":"“You’re going to Nepal, and here is what happened to me. You’re kind of going in a similar fashion to like, to write and like, chase stories. I did that.” [00:24:39]
THERAPIST: What do you think about that?
CLIENT: That just might be who I am, you know, it’s like that. (chuckles) It’s like, with great, you know like, with independence come all of these, you know like... you know, burdens or whatever, so. I don’t know. I’ve always like, I guess I’ve always been like this, where ","P1-N400851":"I’m like, trying to be... the most unique person in the room, you know? (therapist affirms) So... (chuckles) which is funny, because like, now that we’re like, so old (chuckles) and have lived... All of us have had varied experiences, all of us are unique, but... I don’t know. I was ","P1-N400852":"like, “I’m going to... burst everyone’s happy bubble,” I don’t know. (chuckles) Must have been a million reasons why I wanted to share that story. [00:26:18]
THERAPIST: A lot of times, when you share what happens at one of these events, it’s kind of light, or a little bit removed. But I imagine in the moment, you feel things very intensely.
CLIENT: Yeah, probably.
THERAPIST: That leads you to, you know, say what you say or do what you do, that it’s very intense for you.
CLIENT: Hmm... yeah.
THERAPIST: Maybe casual is the word I’m looking for, that when you’re talking about it in here, there is a little bit of a casualness about it. But I don’t imagine it feels casual to you at the time.
CLIENT: Yeah, definitely doesn’t. Um... I don’t... I know I definitely feel things intensely, and I don’t know what exactly you want me to say about that like... I don’t know. Whenever I hang out with these people, I sometimes... certain like, combination of factors makes me ","P1-N400911":"have like, intense reactions to things. I don’t know what it is. Like, what should I explore now? (chuckles) What do you want me to talk about? [00:27:31]
THERAPIST: It wasn’t necessarily a directive. I was just sort of making a comment or an observation that I thought might be helpful for us to think about. (client affirms) It wasn’t like, “We should now talk about this.”
CLIENT: No, but like, in what way helpful like... Like, what are we focusing on? Like the fact that I relate it casually later on or...?
THERAPIST: I mean, that’s certainly one thing. I mean, I guess I was thinking about just, what I was wondering what that experience was like for you in these moments in the group. How you relate it after is interesting, too. (chuckles)
CLIENT: Yeah, oh, at the moment, yeah. Like, it’s like my comparative mood is on. As I feel like, last time, this time was like, must be on for everyone because like, this woman who is going to Nepal like, her parents were... It was never... I don’t really know her for very long like, for ","P1-N400991":"maybe a month. Her parents... they’re you know like, ideal textbook parents (chuckles), you know? In the sense that, you know, her dad has always had a job like, he’s, I don’t know, I think he’s a doctor or something. He’s also kind of idealist and has gone to Africa to ","P1-N400992":"do some aid kind of work. (pause) The mom is very pretty, brought up two kids and like, re-did all her education when she moved to the U.S. She rows (chuckles) like, in the Charles, the team or something. So, you know, I was thinking like, “Oh my gosh! I mean like, these guys could give anyone ","P1-N400993":"a complex, you know? Because they’re like overachievers.” (chuckles) [00:29:24]
THERAPIST: What was it like, you know, sort of seeing and knowing a little about her parents, and you were there with your mother there? What was that like for you?
CLIENT: It was like I said, it wasn’t that intense, because... (pause) (chuckles) It was like, it was senseless even, because like, her mom like, was telling us how like, her grandfather was this famous teacher at a famous university and... Yeah, so it was you know like, “Oh, you know, that’s ","P1-N400A11":"nice and you know, we, yeah, I’ve been to that university.” You know like, Chris was saying, “Yeah, my mom was kind of born there, too.” So, I was kind of removed from it a little bit. I hadn’t slept the night before, so I was tired and I wasn’t like over-thinking ","P1-N400A12":"like a maniac, like I usually do and... [00:32:59]
THERAPIST: What do you mean by resolve?
CLIENT: (sighs) I don’t know! I mean like, will I get married, will I have a child? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Like me?
CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, are you married? (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Yes, I’m married. (ph)
CLIENT: Oh, okay. Yeah, I guess the... (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I was thinking about the “have a child” part, but I guess the whole thing.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Because I had like, as a joke said to Nelson, “Yeah, you know like, by the time you’re 30 you have to have at least three proposals, and I have three proposals.” Like, he was like, “Can I be the fourth?” (chuckles) “I’m the fourth!” ","P1-N400C31":"You know, just like, “Oh, God!” You know? What does that mean? I’m not really sure what this means, but I think that like... now I feel, I’m starting to feel the pressure (chuckles), you know. [00:41:22]
THERAPIST: Pressure of...?
CLIENT: Like, it was all very like, my conflict because I’m just like... yeah. I’m torn between the two of them, but still... Maybe time will take care of it, but I feel like in my head and in my heart, things are still kind of... they’re confused. I’m confused.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, when you first said “resolved,” I thought of it as more of kind of an emotional process.
CLIENT: Yeah, that. That would be nice. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: And then I thought of the “married and child,” I thought was sort of a “club” that you want to belong to?
CLIENT: But not really?
THERAPIST: But then, right, there is the flip side of looking at this woman. Maybe she’s hemmed in or even worse, like your mother, is trapped (client affirms) by marriage. I think it’s a very conflictual thing for you. [00:42:24]
CLIENT: It is. (chuckles) (pause) Which is weird, because like, I, immensely enjoy doing things for... others. Like, that’s like my favorite part of being in a relationship. Oh, are we done or...?
THERAPIST: We have a couple of minutes, you’re fine.
CLIENT: Yeah like, for Chris and even for Nelson. Now, he was like, “Oh, you made me tea when I was sick, that was when I...” I was like, it was like... it was we haven’t even scratched the surface like, that’s nothing. I can do so much more, you know? (chuckles) So... I guess ","P1-N400D71":"the other (inaudible) are two very different things. Like, doing nice things for your partner, versus the whole like... the cage or the commitment of marriage. (paus3) And I guess I’m trying to have one without the other. (chuckles) So... It’s like renting, you know like, versus buying a ","P1-N400D72":"house. Like, all the renovations you can do to a rented place kind of feel like they go nowhere at the end of the day. But when you do it to your own house, it’s something you own, it adds up. (chuckles) It feels like it adds up.
THERAPIST: Well, Cecelia, we’re going to need to stop for today, okay? Thank you for adjusting the time today, I appreciate it.
CLIENT: Oh, no problem.
THERAPIST: And I will see you on Wednesday.
CLIENT: Yeah, see you! Oh, at 9:50?
THERAPIST: Yeah, regular time, exactly.
CLIENT: Okay. Thank you. Have a good day!
THERAPIST: Take care, bye bye.
CLIENT: Bye!
