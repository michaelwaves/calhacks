THERAPIST: Hi, come on in!
CLIENT: Hi, how are you?
THERAPIST: Good, thank you!
CLIENT: I’m sorry, (inaudible). Nice to see you!
THERAPIST: Good to see you as well.
CLIENT: I always want to be like, “How are things?” (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Actually, I did want to touch base with you about, just a little time off I’ll be taking over the summer. I’m actually going to be on maternity leave.
CLIENT: Oh! I didn’t know you were pregnant! (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Yes! So, I’m pregnant!
CLIENT: Congratulations!
THERAPIST: Thank you. Well, I just started to show. (chuckles)
CLIENT: When are you due?
THERAPIST: So, I’m due the third week in June.
CLIENT: Oh my gosh! Wow! You look great! (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Thanks! And I’ll be coming back part-time pretty soon, so, after, so I’ll probably, after about five weeks, I’ll be here, you know, a couple of days a week. So I should be able to...
CLIENT: Okay, yeah, we can figure out a...
THERAPIST: Yeah, a schedule and so forth. But I should, you know, I’m certain the people that I’m seeing now, I should be able to accommodate, you know. [00:01:13]
CLIENT: Okay, great!
THERAPIST: So, especially the daytime. Yeah, so probably... you know, the third week in June to probably, you know, toward the end of July, so about five weeks.
CLIENT: Okay, yeah, that’s fine. That’s fun! That’s great! (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Has he started to pay any sort of child support?
CLIENT: No, so we’re meeting with our mediator on Monday, and so she... So when we talk to her, she said... If we agree on everything, which... Did I tell you? I don’t know if I told you this yet, that we talked to her? That, if we agree... Because we’re both wanting to do the joint ","P1-N4005D1":"file, the one where it’s like, we do it together, so we don’t have to be in the court system forever. So, and he really wants to do that one, too, because he doesn’t want to pay for a lawyer, like, lawyers and everything. So she said if we agree on everything, that we could pretty ","P1-N4005D2":"much finalize everything in two sessions with her, which are like, each two hours. So she was like, “We could it in like four hours, maybe six, if you... like, we need to talk something out.” [00:15:09]
THERAPIST: You shouldn’t be paying half for things, because you’re not getting any money from him. [00:18:52]
CLIENT: Well, I’m paying for like, my gym. Like, he’ll be like, your gym got like, because I have a gym membership. So he’s like, “Your gym just got pulled from our joint, so you need to add for that, or your car insurance...” My car insurance, I have to put in for that. ","P1-N4006B1":"So right now, we’re paying like... no, it’s a mess. I mean... I don’t know. I mean, I hope he, they give me money (chuckles) retroactively. And like, I had a huge expense just moving like, buying everything and moving. It’s just been... really expensive.
THERAPIST: It will be very soon, that he’ll start giving you money.
CLIENT: Right. So that’s why I’m kind of holding off right now. I’m hoping like, I could start getting money in the next like, few weeks or something. And just to even like... I’m almost like, working on this like, “ignorance is bliss” kind of thing, where I’m ","P1-N400711":"actually just like, not even thinking about the money, because I think when I do think about it, I start to like, really get stressed out about it. (pause) Because I worry, I can’t like, pay for things, you know?
THERAPIST: You’re worried you won’t be able to live on the child support, alimony, and your salary?
CLIENT: No, that I think I can. I think... and I know, I think right now, I definitely can’t live on just my salary. Like, that’s, that’s a very true statement. I can’t. There is no way, because of my rent, you know. And daycare. Daycare is a big chunk, so...
THERAPIST: And you’re paying daycare? [00:21:04]
CLIENT: (affirms) Yeah, we, he is having me pay 35% of daycare, but his parents pay the rest of his share. So he doesn’t want to pay daycare out of his wallet, I guess you could say. (pause) But I don’t know if he’s going to, I mean, I don’t know if he would, like he’d ","P1-N400791":"have to say that, I guess, that he gets money from his parents, I don’t know.
THERAPIST: Yeah, you actually do have to claim that. (client affirms) Do you think he’s going to be honest about claiming money?
CLIENT: I don’t know. (pause) I don’t know.
THERAPIST: He would, I mean, you’ll find out when you meet with the mediator, but you’ll have to figure out if you can actually do this mediation.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, if he’s saying like, he doesn’t get any money from his parents... I know the only money he had, we’ve always just gotten this money for daycare. They’ve always given us like, $800 or $900, it’s like $900 for daycare every month. They’ve ","P1-N400811":"just always done that, and that’s it. So I would be shocked if he goes in there and says he’s not getting that. I would just be like, “Are you really telling the truth? Because why would your mom stop paying it? (chuckles) Like, especially when you’re going through a divorce. ","P1-N400812":"I would think your mother would keep paying it.” What I don’t know is if his parents are giving him extra money every month. Which they could! I have no idea. [00:22:37]
THERAPIST: I think you, I imagine you would have to produce bank statements.
CLIENT: Oh, yeah. That’s true. That’s true. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I mean, yeah. I think, I just need to know the number. Once I have a number of how much I’m getting, then I think I’ll calm down. I think right now, I’m just like, in this very unknown, financially, ","P1-N400851":"and it’s like, making me nervous; like, super nervous... because I just, I mean, I don’t know how... I can afford everything. There is no way. I don’t make that much. I mean, he makes double what I make, so... I mean, his, the condo is a little bit more than my apartment, I think, ","P1-N400852":"but and he has a car payment. But I don’t think he’s paying daycare, which is like, a big chunk, you know.
THERAPIST: I imagine you’ll get close to a third of his salary, in child support and alimony, I guess. [00:23:43]
CLIENT: Yeah, I would imagine they would, I just figure they would try to keep us like, more balanced, more like, even. So, yeah like, they would do that. And then he has to pay... yeah. My friend, my brother was like, “You should watch Divorce Court.” It’s like, this documentary and ","P1-N400891":"I watched the trailer yesterday. It looked horrible. It was terrifying. I was like, “I’m not watching that!” (chuckles) It’s about these divorces that are in court for like, years; like, years! And like, that was the people who have to sell their possessions to like, pay for ","P1-N400892":"their fees and like, I don’t want to do that. Although I will... I think I will sell my diamond rings very soon. I think once the divorce is final, then I’m selling my diamonds. Right? Why keep them?
THERAPIST: (pause) If you don’t want them.
CLIENT: I don’t! I always think, “Oh, I could give it to Brady. He could give it to his like...,” but they’re like, inscribed and everything. I could get a lot of money for them, I think. A friend gave me the name of a guy I could sell them to! (chuckles) But I could get at least, ","P1-N4008D1":"hopefully like, $11,000 or something for them. And they’re just in my purse. I just walk around with them in my purse. [00:24:52]
THERAPIST: You could probably also bring, because a mediator is there to help you not only financially, but just negotiate your relationship. (client affirms) And I’m sure that she can help you with this issue around him. I shouldn’t say I’m sure she could help you, but I’m sure ","P1-N4008F1":"you can bring up the issue around him disclosing all this private information. I think that would be actually very helpful to talk about when you meet her.
CLIENT: Yeah, my friend had said that. She was like, “You should bring that up with the mediator, that he, you know...” And I don’t know if that’s, is it like, agreed upon that you don’t... do it?
THERAPIST: Obviously, you can’t regulate it or (client affirms) anything, but in terms of, a mediator is not just there to help you with the logistics. It’s there, he or she is there to help you with the relationship.
CLIENT: Oh, got it, okay.
THERAPIST: Like, with the whole process (client affirms) and that’s sort of what they’re trained in.
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean... That would, I just, yeah, I think... and I mean, I don’t know if he has said more to people recently. I mean, he seemed kind of concerned, when I was so upset about it. But I don’t know if it’s enough to... stop it, you know? (therapist affirms) But I will definitely ","P1-N400991":"bring that up, because it’s just like... it’s just, no one wants to hear it, you know. [00:26:07]
THERAPIST: Dogs are expensive!
CLIENT: They are expensive!
THERAPIST: Really expensive.
CLIENT: I love him. I adore him. He’s wonderful. I’ve had him for five years, but... I’m just so... thinking I need to give him to... I have a co-worker who watches him when I go away. My co-worker is in his 50’s. He and his wife love him and he loves them. They have a big house ","P1-N400A31":"with a big yard in Greenwich. She’s retired, so she’s home. You know, I feel bad that he just sits in this apartment by himself all day, while at working late or you know... [00:27:14]
THERAPIST: Once you figure out how much you’re getting, you can then figure out what you can afford.
CLIENT: Right. Yeah, that’s true. Like, if I’m only getting a certain amount, and I have to still cut something. I know he would go to a wonderful home, and I know I could see him again, because I’m very good friends with, my friend’s nuts about him. You know, I could watch him ","P1-N400A91":"for them when they go away or whatever. And he said he would take him, so... But he was like, “I just want you to be sure.” So he was like, “Why don’t you wait a little while and then let me know.” [00:28:27]
THERAPIST: Well, the finances are very real, but they’re also part of your feeling secure on your own.
CLIENT: Right. Yeah, because I’m feeling... I feel, in general... I mean, obviously you saw me on a really crappy day, but... and I’m sure I’ll have other crappy days, but... in general, I’m feeling okay about everything else. Definitely okay about leaving, definitely... still ","P1-N400AD1":"need to deal with my parents like, they want me to come home next month, so... My brother was like, “They just want to talk to you.” And it’s like... It’s going to be a really... difficult conversation, because he’s like, “They just don’t understand.” ","P1-N400AD2":"You know, that mom was really upset.
THERAPIST: She was a little further along than you (client affirms), and gave you a vision of what it could be.
CLIENT: Yeah, when I walked in her place, I was like, “I could have a, I could...” Like, she seemed very settled, which was nice. Like, she... you know, it was like, what I liked about it was, it was nice in that it had a lot of rooms, but her stuff wasn’t that ni . I mean, she, ","P1-N400CB1":"like, you could tell, it was like... my stuff, where it wasn’t like, super fancy and that it had been given to her. She was like, “Oh, yeah. My friend gave me that table.” Like, every, you know where she was like, “Oh, yeah, my friend gave me like, the kitchen table.” Like ","P1-N400CB2":"me, where people were giving me stuff, she’s like, “Yeah, all this stuff people like, gave me.” So she’s like, “Nothing really matches,” but it still looked nice, you know. [00:38:02]
THERAPIST: It sounds like you’re really trying to create something for yourself.
CLIENT: I’m trying.
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you’re not only trying, but you’re being pretty successful at it, too.
CLIENT: I hope so! (chuckles) Now my friends tell me I need to start dating. (chuckles) They’re funny. But I’ll get to that at some point, I’m sure.
THERAPIST: You should start dating when you feel ready. (client affirms) But I can hear... you really look toward others for guidance, and you get a lot of good guidance. But I can hear sometimes that you feel... like, I don’t know if pressure is the right word, but you really rely on them.
CLIENT: Yeah, totally.
THERAPIST: Maybe sometimes, questioning your own judgment in it.
CLIENT: Right. Yeah, I’m a big like, “What do you guys think?” (pause) Yeah. [00:40:45]
THERAPIST: Rather than sometimes feeling secure in what you think is right for you.
CLIENT: Right, right. Like, I... yeah. I’m usually like, “Uh, I kind of want to do this. Do you think that’s like, a good idea?” And they’ll... usually they’re like, “Yeah!” Or, you know, my one friend, Kayla (ph) is like, “Do what you feel like ","P1-N400E31":"you should do.” Or that’s kind of what she says to me. She’s like, “This is like... what this is about like, do what you think you want to do.” She was like, if I see you doing something really dangerous, I’ll tell you! (chuckles) But she’s like, I don’t ","P1-N400E32":"think you will. So... And then I started my marathon, my half-marathon training, so...
THERAPIST: It’s been nicer outside!
CLIENT: I know! Because I ran this morning, before work. I ran yesterday, so I feel like I’m kind of healing the mind and the body. We’ll see how it goes.
THERAPIST: Cool! (client affirms) We’re going, we just have another minute or so left. I was going to ask you if you, talk about money, have you heard anything from the insurance?
CLIENT: No, I haven’t. But I have a check, so I can write a check for... I think I owe like $700! (chuckles) or something. [00:41:49]
THERAPIST: Well, I was going to, I’m happy to, you should actually have heard from the insurance. I would definitely call them.
CLIENT: Should I call them?
THERAPIST: Yeah, I would definitely call them.
CLIENT: I submitted December and January, and then I just got, Janine (ph) just sent me February’s. Although February’s... for the... because we only had two sessions in February, one of them was the recorded one, but it was still the same price. Is that right?
THERAPIST: I can, yeah. I don’t actually think I started to record (client affirms), but... Oh, do you have the consent form?
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Oh, great. But that’s okay. I’ll let her know. I’ll let her know... what... know about that. I’ll give you a revised rate. I’ll give you the revised rate. You know, it’s up to you. If you want to just, why don’t you... why don’t you call them. ","P1-N400F91":"I mean, I understand that finances are really tight (client affirms), so why don’t you...
CLIENT: I mean, I want to pay you! I don’t want to like... make you work for free, either! So...
THERAPIST: That’s okay. Why don’t you call them and find out what the story is for February.
CLIENT: I’ll call them when I get back to my office. (therapist affirms) I have lunch with someone, but then I’ll call this afternoon. Then I can e-mail you and Janine, and just let you know what they said.
THERAPIST: Sure, because you should have, you should definitely have gotten reimbursement. It usually...
CLIENT: Because it’s March! I mean...
THERAPIST: Yeah, usually...
CLIENT: It said 30 days, so I figured well, it’s been a little over, maybe... And then I got nervous that it went to my house, and that Rich like, took the money. So I actually just thought that, as I was driving here. But... And I can’t imagine he would do that; that would be really messed up. [00:43:10]
THERAPIST: Well, why don’t you, find out what the story is. (client affirms) Yeah, I mean, I’m like, I’m fine if you have to wait to get reimbursed, just as long they are planning on reimbursing you, so... Then I’ll make sure for... starting that second session, it’s fine. ","P1-N401091":"We’ll just go to the $40. So then, what we’ll do is, you’ll just sign over the insurance checks to me. (client affirms) And then it will be the $40 in addition. (client affirms) You know what I’m saying? So rather than... so basically, I’m going to get paid directly from ","P1-N401092":"the insurance after they, you know, starting at the end of February or whatever. Does that make sense?
CLIENT: So, so right... sorry. So right now, when I get the reimbursement, I’ll deposit that into my account and then (therapist affirms) write you a check.
THERAPIST: The reimbursement for January, and I guess the first session in February, if you want to do it that way. (client affirms) If you want to pay it, as, you know, again, if the difference is really big, let me know and I’m happy to work out something (client affirms) more reasonable. But ","P1-N4010D1":"then after, starting when we, with the taping, then you’ll just, when you get the reimbursement, you can just sign the check over to me, and then it will just be $40 for you on top of that. Does that make sense? [00:44:11]
CLIENT: So... sorry. I’m sorry, I’m still confused. So then... the $40 ones, I’ll still submit as an invoice like, I have been?
THERAPIST: Right. You submit. Well, basically, right now what we’ve been doing...
CLIENT: Will it list as $195?
THERAPIST: Exactly.
CLIENT: Oh, okay. Well that’s probably what she did.
THERAPIST: It will list... Yeah, she just doesn’t know. I haven’t told her yet, to adjust the fee. So you’re going to get statements every month for $195 like, the same.
CLIENT: No matter what, okay.
THERAPIST: And that you submit to the insurance.
CLIENT: So then...
THERAPIST: Then you’ll get a separate statement from me, just for the $40 per session. So that you submit. They’re not going to give you $195, they’re not going to give you the full amount. I don’t know what they’re going to give you. They’ll give you something. But ","P1-N401211":"they’ll give you... so whatever, from after like, after January, whenever we started, whatever they reimburse, you know, you can give to me, and then just $40 on top of that. But you’ll still get the statements as is, because those still need to go to the insurance. (client affirms) Does ","P1-N401212":"that make sense?
CLIENT: Yes. So then, just so I know how much then going forward will I be paying monthly? [00:45:12]
THERAPIST: Well, $40 times how many...
CLIENT: Times we do it. (therapist affirms) So I’m thinking maybe right now, should we just do it twice a month?
THERAPIST: I mean, I think it, you know, it’s up to you. Does $40 a session feel a little more than you can afford now, too?
CLIENT: I just feel like to pay... $160 a month right now is a little... I just, because I don’t know how much I’m getting and I...
THERAPIST: Well, hopefully, you’ll have clarity starting next week. (client affirms) So... it’s up to you. I mean, I’m happy to see you, I don’t want to have you go in the poorhouse (client affirms), I can really appreciate that. And again, if, for January, if the discrepancy ","P1-N4012D1":"between my fee and what they’re reimbursing you is too big, I’m happy to adjust my fee for that, even though we didn’t start for the (inaudible) recording.
CLIENT: Thank you so much.
THERAPIST: But yeah. I mean, in general, it would be $160 a month, if we met four times a week.
CLIENT: So maybe, maybe for right, maybe for the next, maybe this next month, we’ll do every other week until I know how much it is. Is that crazy to do?
THERAPIST: That’s okay. I mean, honestly, if it has to be $30 a session, I mean like, I’m really willing to work with you. I don’t think I could do half (client affirms), but I’m really willing to work with you, because I do want to con , you know, continue meeting consistently. ","P1-N401351":"So... [00:46:23]
CLIENT: I mean, we could... Well, let’s, then let’s keep it every week, and then I’ll know Monday. So when I see you Wednesday, I could be like, “He is not giving me anything!” (chuckles) Or something.
THERAPIST: Well, I don’t...think that will happen.
CLIENT: I don’t think that will be the case, but...
THERAPIST: But yeah, just call the insurance and we’ll figure out January and somehow...
CLIENT: Okay, I’ll call them today and I’ll e-mail you both.
THERAPIST: Okay, because I understand that it would be very helpful for you to get, have the money from the insurance before you pay me for January.
CLIENT: Yeah, that’s pretty much... And then, I also submitted some expense reports at work, because, and that’s like... like, $800. So I was like, well, and they’re going to give me that soon, so I was like, I could use that to pay that bill, too. So...
THERAPIST: Right. Just, yeah, call the insurance, see what the story is, in terms of their...
CLIENT: Okay, what’s going on.
THERAPIST: Yeah, because they should really be paying that out already (client affirms) and even if it takes a few more weeks, I can at least just charge you the difference, so you don’t have to pay the whole amount. We can at least (inaudible\/blocked).
CLIENT: Okay, so at least e-mail me the amount that they’re sending me or something. [00:47:13]
THERAPIST: Yeah, and then you don’t have to put out the whole amount. (client affirms) Okay, does that make sense? Okay.
CLIENT: Okay, that will work. Thank you so much for being so like, flexible with it.
THERAPIST: Sure, sure.
CLIENT: I want to get you paid, I swear!
THERAPIST: No, I’m totally fine, and you’re still just working out some stuff and clearly, I would tell you if it weren’t fine.
CLIENT: Okay, all right. Thank you. Congratulations again!
THERAPIST: Thank you so much!
CLIENT: Okay, I’ll see you next week.
THERAPIST: Take care, okay, bye bye.
