TITLE: Client "ML" Therapy Session Audio Recording, January 02, 2013: Clients discuss the pros and cons of their recent trip home to visit family.
DESCRIPTION: Clients discuss the pros and cons of their recent trip home to visit family.
THERAPIST: Hi. Good morning.
THERAPIST: Oh, thank you.
THERAPIST: And I submitted your claims before going on, so -
THERAPIST: Sure.
THERAPIST: Yep. And to you.
CLIENT: Tense. (Laughs)
CLIENT: I'm wondering whether, do you have any other times open during the week? I'm finding that trying to see Chad and then coming here, I feel really drained when I come here and I feel like I don't have as much attention as I want to have and so I can I think Chad is trying to figure out how for ","P1-N400231":"me to meet with him on Monday so I can try to switch the time earlier this morning with him or I can try to switch this time with you.
THERAPIST: Okay. What are you looking are you looking to meet on a day you're not seeing Chad?
CLIENT: Just not quite so close.
THERAPIST: Back to back?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I could yeah, let me take a look. It sounds like your schedules are otherwise fairly flexible.
CLIENT: Yeah. (Laughs)
THERAPIST: I should have something. I'm teaching a course but it ends at the end of January so my Tuesdays are going to open up a lot because I teach on Tuesdays. So that's a possibility and I'll take a look. The other possibility is Thursday afternoon.
CLIENT: Okay. I meet with him on Thursdays around 1. So.
THERAPIST: (Cross talk).
THERAPIST: Sorry. I don't have anything else on Wednesday or Monday at this time. I definitely will have something on Tuesday afternoon.
CLIENT: Okay. Yeah, that sounds like it would be good.
THERAPIST: I (unclear) on Tuesday mornings but I'll talk with him about seeing if I can switch this morning time to Monday.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: See if that and if not Tuesday afternoon is definitely a possibility.
CLIENT: So we're going to try to try to switch to Monday anyway instead of Thursdays.
THERAPIST: Right. Wednesday afternoon might open up and early in the afternoon might be a possibility. I don't know if that's going to help much. I don't know.
THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah, check in with him and if not, I'll let you know what times I could do.
CLIENT: Okay, thank you so much. Yeah, so okay, I'm tired but we had a really good Christmas, actually. It was a really good visit with family. I personally am doing a lot better. I feel like we are doing pretty well right now, too, which is really good.
CLIENT: That's true. Yeah. You know, things are ratcheting up again. Yeah, visiting family was good. It was a little tough. It's always a little tough, you know?
THERAPIST: Tough in what way?
CLIENT: Oh, we have lots of family and they really like us which is good but they want to spend a lot like all of our time with us and they all have lots of opinions lots of opinions. And so figuring out how to kind of stay sane and stay centered in the middle of that can be hard I think.
THERAPIST: Is that about right?
CLIENT: I feel like I have trained people into being okay with me sleeping, which is good.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think the trick is not to see her with my siblings, just to have the two of us to be there with her.
THERAPIST: What makes that better?
CLIENT: She feels like we gang up on her otherwise, the three of us. She never says that but she really likes to be the center of the conversation and I think she feels lonely and distant from us because my siblings and I are very, very close and my sister kind of raised my brother and I and I think ","P1-N4005F1":"because my mom left and I think she feels badly about that and really wants to be the mom but doesn't really have a very clear idea of what moms do and we tend to resent it when she tries to be the mom and also I think my sister is less good at hiding resentment and frustration than I am around my mom. ","P1-N4005F2":"So, you know, it's easier for things to just like slide off my back than Amanda and I get anxious when Amanda is worked up or upset.
CLIENT: Yeah, and I'm pretty upset with her, too, but I have very different ways of handling it than Amanda does.
CLIENT: My mom always does the thing where I'm always the good child and Amanda's always the bad child. We know I'm very much her favorite and you would think that that would be a good thing for me but it's really not. And you know, I just worship Amanda and always have and so you know I think mom wants ","P1-N400671":"to be closer to me than Amanda is and that's not going to happen.
THERAPIST: How old were you when she left?
CLIENT: I was seven.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That's really young.
CLIENT: Yeah. It was really bad and I missed her a whole lot. Amanda was I guess, nine and a half and -
THERAPIST: Did she leave in part because she just couldn't function?
CLIENT: She, I mean, I think she tried to kill herself. She left. She either tried to kill herself or she ended up in the hospital one way or another but I think she tried to kill herself.
CLIENT: But not until latter days at least.
CLIENT: Yeah, so she was she just wasn't functioning. She was certainly really unhappy with my dad. Something needed to change and so it changed. But, that's -
THERAPIST: What?
CLIENT: But so, James and mom get along really, really well. She just adores him. She likes men but she also really likes you. I don't think there are really that many, I don't think there are that many people who are involved with Amanda and I, who know us, who don't feel the need to take sides between ","P1-N400871":"us and mom. I think you're very good at, yeah, at not taking sides, even though also you are on my side.
CLIENT: (Laughs)
CLIENT: Exactly, that. (Laughs)
CLIENT: And you know it's a present issue for me, too, I think. I just placate along with Amanda.
CLIENT: I think they're similar but not the same thing. And in a way that's really good that you are with me.
THERAPIST: Was it okay for you, too?
CLIENT: Yeah, well we started dating when she and I weren't talking. Like that was right in that mess.
CLIENT: One person will say something contentious and another person will jump on them and then everybody else starts in, too. It's yeah, yeah, mostly on Cory, his second to the youngest brother who is nothing if not contentious.
CLIENT: He's sort of just learning to keep his mouth shut.
CLIENT: Not like keeping his mouth shut all the time. He shouldn't do that but learning like when to pick his battles is the hard thing I think for him. You know he likes to disagree violently with a statement and then say hold on to being right regardless of what is actually the case at all. So ","P1-N400AB1":"that naturally irritates people, so yeah, everybody jumps on him. I ended up talking a lot less in those kind of conversations because I feel like it's not that I don't have an opinion, it's not like I wouldn't feel comfortable sharing my opinion, it's just I feel like there are enough opinions flying ","P1-N400AB2":"around already.
CLIENT: You do a lot of mediating.
THERAPIST: I was just thinking that word "mediator." Is that what it feels like?
CLIENT: Yeah, I think it doesn't help that a lot of times that person who believes these things and thus is an idiot is me, and I'm not always going to say that I violently disagree with somebody but, or maybe not often I'm going to say that, but James usually knows and so I think a lot of, or a fair ","P1-N400B51":"amount of trying to say, 'well, you know, some people can see it this way,' out of care for me I guess. I appreciate that.
CLIENT: Yeah, because you know God forbid I have a confrontation (unclear).
CLIENT: Yeah. I've gotten better at speaking up when I disagree with things. Sometimes it's useful and sometimes it's not. I think they really like me and I really like them. Which is good.
CLIENT: I was going to say, 'that's what you get when you go away with Tanya,' but yeah -
CLIENT: That's true.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I found visiting with just your dad and just your mom difficult as well as good. Because that was the only time when it was incumbent upon me to talk about what's going on with me and you know, that's really hard.
CLIENT: James's dad asking, 'how was I doing, what was I doing now?' You know with job searches and so forth. It just took a lot out of me to answer. I had to go back and go upstairs and hide for a little bit. Yeah.
THERAPIST: What was hard about that?
CLIENT: I am just really scared. I am really scared about looking for a job and really ashamed that I don't have one. I worry that James's parents will think I'm not a good wife for their son and I worry that I'm not doing what I need to do to keep us going.
CLIENT: And then when we're at the museum with James's mom we ran into a friend of mine from high school, which I knew was going to happen. I wore nice clothes to the museum specifically because whenever I go out in San Antonio I see people I know. And you know, I really like this woman and her husband. ","P1-N400D51":"I just don't want to talk to anybody. I'm ashamed to talk to people.
THERAPIST: Is your fear because they'll ask you what you're doing?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. That's mostly true. I said I was mostly looking for teaching jobs now' yeah, I really miss teaching. Yeah, the only way for me not to leave so much out of that response is to make it substantially not true. I feel like I don't want to tell everybody. It's sort of not appropriate to tell ","P1-N400DF1":"everybody like, 'oh, I'm looking for a job because I've been suicidal for the last several months. Severely depressed for the last couple of years and I can't hold down a job, I can't function anymore.'
THERAPIST: Well, that's one characterization of what's going on.
CLIENT: I know.
THERAPIST: I could also think about that you're struggling to figure out what kind of life you want to lead and how you want to be in the world and what kind of vocation you want and the struggle is painful right now.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But it sounds like it really taps into a deep sense of inadequacy.
CLIENT: Yes. Yes.
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I feel like I'm not in school anymore because I wasn't good enough for it.
THERAPIST: You look so pensive there when you said that.
CLIENT: Thanks, I know.
THERAPIST: So what if Tanya says that do you not agree to yourself? Or do you sometimes explicitly not agree?
THERAPIST: What is it like to hear Tanya express that about herself?
CLIENT: You're wrong. (Laughs)
CLIENT: Thanks.
THERAPIST: Outraged at the injustice?
CLIENT: Maybe we should not be giving advice on colleges to somebody like Billy.
CLIENT: He's just -
CLIENT: It's okay. I wasn't ready to talk anymore anyway. (Unclear).
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean especially since one of the I guess, some sort of goals is that you both have is for you to (unclear) to express yourself more in here.
CLIENT: (Laughs)
THERAPIST: That's my understanding.
THERAPIST: It seems like that's one thing that you both want.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Were you feeling I'm sorry, what were you going to say?
CLIENT: Oh no. I don't remember. It was not important. I remember that.
CLIENT: Well, it didn't seem important anyway.
THERAPIST: Well, we'll table that for the -
THERAPIST: I just wanted to ask James what you were saying about a kind of self-sacrifice piece. Were you were talking about Tanya's family in particular?
THERAPIST: When you were talking about sort of seeing an injustice and sort of how Tanya was treated when you were talking about the sacrifices you sacrifice this for to get this so I didn't know if you were referring specifically to her family.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I wasn't sure.
THERAPIST: It sort of feels like that there's some sort of glory in self-sacrifice.
CLIENT: I'm not sure if I would call it glory but it certainly seems like I have to sacrifice my own opinions and desires in order to keep her happy. And for whatever reason the idea of not trying to keep her happy is unbearable to the point that I'd scarcely even consider it. You know, I was always ","P1-N401631":"afraid that she was going to kill herself when I was little so I always thought it was my job to keep her safe.
THERAPIST: Did you feel able to do that?
CLIENT: Not really. But I felt like nobody else was going to or why there was nothing else I could do.
THERAPIST: You don't feel like your father was invested in that?
CLIENT: Well, I mean this was after they were divorced. (Unclear). And she dated around a whole lot but they were all more or less scumbags so I didn't ever really think any of them were going to stick around and they didn't.
THERAPIST: Did it feel like a zero-sum game like the more she had the less you had (inaudible)?
CLIENT: Yeah. Still does to a large extent.
THERAPIST: Is she still suicidal?
CLIENT: I don't think so. No.
THERAPIST: Is she in a better place than you were when she was younger?
CLIENT: Yeah. It's only in the last 10 years I guess, maybe the last five even. But she's been significantly better. And she's finally like found a therapist who works really well with her. She's been seeing this woman for 10 years and I think depends on her a lot but seems to be in a much better place. ","P1-N401791":"At least in terms of suicidality I think. She's very fragile and she doesn't have a lot of relationships.
CLIENT: Oh. I was going to say that I see what you mean I mean in that and I agree with you about the, in some sense I kind of really got played. And yet that doesn't make me not feel like it's my fault or like even if I were better I wouldn't be able to feel that.
CLIENT: I know.
CLIENT: I guess I feel like for whatever reason I've got some breathing space and I don't think it's going to last and that scares me a lot. You know we still have James's stuff in storage. So that's saying, let's really try to get that out soon because I'm doing well now and I'm not sure how long that's ","P1-N401851":"going to be so I don't know how I'm going to be able to help with that.
CLIENT: (Laughs) It's important to me.
THERAPIST: So when Tanya says that, where does that go in you? The sort of fear that this is sort of a momentary (unclear) of betterness.
CLIENT: That'll be nice.
THERAPIST: Do you feel that way?
CLIENT: I want to say what about what the benefits of having a job could have for me but you know -
CLIENT: Optimistic?
CLIENT: Yeah, I think it's a possibility that I would not relapse or would not as severely if my life situation changed, but -
THERAPIST: That was my guess that you feel differently about this.
CLIENT: Yeah. You know, I keep making changes.
THERAPIST: I'm sorry.
CLIENT: I keep making changes in my life. I've changed day to day so much in the last year so many times to try to like I kept thinking if I can just get to this place with all the external stuff then the internal will be better and it just hasn't happened. So. Yeah, I guess I'm less optimistic about that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
CLIENT: Thanks.
THERAPIST: Do you feel like James carries optimism for you?
CLIENT: A lot of the time, yeah. (Pause) I'm usually pretty optimistic actually, but I've run out of it in the last year or two.
CLIENT: You don't have to. It would be okay if you were pessimistic.
CLIENT: I know. Just being the optimist can be kind of a burden. I don't really think of myself as the optimist, so it doesn't really feel like a burden. Yeah, what have we come to when you're the optimist of this couple? (Laughs)
THERAPIST: I'm missing a piece of that.
CLIENT: James's just usually pretty cynical I think. And pretty, doesn't let what he wants to happen interfere with his judgment of what is going to happen most of the time. I try not to. It doesn't mean I'm actually that good at it, but -
CLIENT: You're usually a lot better at it than I am.
CLIENT: People are really bad at that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
CLIENT: I actually want to know, too.
THERAPIST: That's an interesting question. Usually it's noted as pause. I don't think they normally note because I've actually seen transcripts. I usually don't. I just basically provide the audio recording although transcripts are very helpful. But a huge bonus actually if someone transcribes the sessions ","P1-N401D91":"so you can look it over (cross talk and laughter). But yeah, usually it's just a pause.
THERAPIST: Are you aware of the pauses?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What do they feel like?
CLIENT: Yeah, me too.
CLIENT: Sometimes.
CLIENT: Most of the time.
THERAPIST: Certainly not.
CLIENT: There are so many things I could say to that. (Laughs)
THERAPIST: Like what?
CLIENT: Like are you sure?
THERAPIST: Is he sure or sorry?
CLIENT: Are you sure that speaking isn't losing? Oh, we're just making fun of you for (unclear) talking as much. Although it's not even that you don't talk as much, I think. I just had this expectation that you do.
THERAPIST: Oh.
THERAPIST: Well this is, yeah, I mean I think you talk, I don't know a lot, but you certainly express at some point I can never sort of, in a very theoretical way never know what people do not express, right? But I was just thinking about you know, how much like plans and structure and how among the ","P1-N402111":"things that are difficult about your situation and Tanya's situation together is sort of how amorphous and unpredictable it is. I was thinking that when I asked I forgot exactly what it is that you said. It wasn't the comment about feeling inadequate. It was a later comment and I asked you, 'oh, that ","P1-N402112":"you were less optimistic that a job would make a difference and I asked where it went in you and you sort of thought it as sort of a plan. So -
CLIENT: Sorry I made fun of you.
CLIENT: No, not at all. One thing I was thinking is I really want to keep in mind any anxiety you might have about maybe having a map that has less contours than you might like.
THERAPIST: You know, I want to it's sort of reflected and maybe they're certainly structured to the session but there's also a lot that's not structured and so I was really thinking about your comment about that at that lack of those silences really speak to a lack of structure I feel like because ","P1-N4021D1":"there's really not quite the turn taking that really happens through normal social conventions, right? So it is a lot less structured in that way.
THERAPIST: What came up.
THERAPIST: Were some of these things things you talked about since, you know, during the trip or since the trip?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What was new?
CLIENT: I don't think I told you, James, that I was worried his parents would be disappointed in me.
CLIENT: Fair enough. I guess they probably wouldn't be.
CLIENT: Well I like to think I covered it pretty well.
THERAPIST: We are going to need to stop for today. Let's so we'll meet next week, the three of us. I'm aware that I met with James individually and I usually like to meet both partners individually and also very aware that you're feeling very worn out by all the therapy you're doing so let's talk ","P1-N4023B1":"about that next time. I was going to say, next week I have something in the early afternoon, or mid afternoon. Would that help just for next week and I'll be looking to schedule after that?
CLIENT: Yeah, that would really help.
THERAPIST: I'll look at the schedule after that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I might have I need to take a look but I think I might have -
CLIENT: We don't need to change everything right away. I just wanted to move toward moving -
THERAPIST: Well, why don't well, okay, for next week I could do 2:40 on Wednesday rather than 10:45 without (unclear)?
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Let's do that and we'll figure it out from there.
CLIENT: Okay. Thanks.
THERAPIST: Okay, well I'll see you guys next week. Okay, take care.
CLIENT: Thank you.
