DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the recent trip to a friend's apartment and her interest in houses and life being beautiful instead of messy. Client discusses moving in with her boyfriend.
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in. (pause) [00:02:00]
CLIENT: I'm hot. Let me just take this off. (pause) Did you have a nice weekend?
THERAPIST: I did. Thank you.
CLIENT: (laughter) Were you here or did you go to Ohio?
THERAPIST: I was here. What made you think about Ohio?
CLIENT: Oh, just, you went to Ohio last time.
THERAPIST: Oh, I was in Ohio. Right. When I had a day off at that time.
CLIENT: Oh.
THERAPIST: Right. I think that was over Christmas.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. [00:03:00]
THERAPIST: Where did you go?
CLIENT: I was thinking of several things. Like, yeah. I don't know how to... I was thinking about living by myself versus living with Chris (sp?) and the kind of people I admire and the anxieties it brings me, but then if I don't see him then I kind of feel that something's missing or something essential ","P1-N4002B1":"is missing. Like, yesterday I crashed this gentleman's tea that one of my friends was having. He invited Chris and he's very particular. Like, he invited me and didn't invite Chris. So, and now he invited Chris, but not me. [00:10:00]
THERAPIST: Nothing bad happens in what?
CLIENT: My friend's world.
THERAPIST: Oh, I see.
CLIENT: I'm sure it does, but not that I. I don't see it that way.
THERAPIST: How is it protected from nothing bad?
CLIENT: I don't know. Right? I don't see ugliness. It's so obvious to me in my scenario. You know? (pause) I mean I see what you're trying to say. This is going to my thinking where I think oh, everything bad is in my life and people, other people don't have sorrow. Am I right? [00:13:30]
THERAPIST: Maybe. I mean I guess that's, that's maybe an interpretation of what I'm saying. Except I'm questioning how you're thinking about it. So, I guess you could say it's a flaw, but I'm also just wondering how you think that happens. Like, the process.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah. In my childhood everything was just, well, like the house physically was never pretty. Like, my mom was never interested in maintaining the picture perfect household. Maybe because she was always having to work and then didn't have enough strength to come back home and cook as well ","P1-N400431":"as beautify the place. Plus, you know, that whole tension of dealing with my dad and his many, many affairs probably made her, you know, debilitated her psychologically or emotionally so that she didn't really care about wanting to do, you know, wanting to straighten up or make it look nice. So, it ","P1-N400432":"was always a mess and it physically looked bad. You know? Well, you know I didn't have a choice back then. [00:15:00]
THERAPIST: Does it defeat you?
CLIENT: What?
THERAPIST: You said it doesn't defeat them in this area. So, I'm asking you if it defeats you?
CLIENT: Well, it defeats my mom, I guess. Yeah. (pause) I mean it defeats me in other areas that I really don't like which is to just kind of shut up and not be interested in anything and not want to engage in anything. Like, be afraid of a lot of things. [00:17:30] (pause)
THERAPIST: You second guessed yourself. [00:22:15]
CLIENT: No. Earlier I thought I you said something about the way she was talking to me was aggressive or something about it. Something was aggressive. I don't know what exactly now.
THERAPIST: I don't see the two, being passive and being aggressive, are mutually exclusive.
CLIENT: That's true. There are things that are passive and aggressive.
THERAPIST: There is.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I know. [00:22:40]
THERAPIST: Do you feel distracted or do you feel sort of very internally focused?
CLIENT: I feel sleepy. (laughter) I don't know if I'm completely alert and engaged and active and thinking. I'm trying hard to be alert.
THERAPIST: Where is your mind going otherwise?
CLIENT: Well, I'm just thinking about different things, but it's not really like anything streamlined or a narrative even. You know? [00:26:20]
THERAPIST: What does in earnest mean? What do you mean by that?
CLIENT: When I don't have any pretenses. I don't have any excuses. Like, I'm not going to be paying rent in the other place anymore. Yeah. It's totally gone. Like, yeah. Previously, I would tell other people yeah, I live, you know, at this other place. So.
THERAPIST: And, now you say you live with Chris?
CLIENT: I haven't said anything yet to anyone. (laughter) Maybe I'll say I live with my mom.
THERAPIST: You don't want people to know that you live with Chris?
CLIENT: I don't know yet. I like him, but I just don't feel like too much. I don't feel like this one is it. You know, take his arm and, you know, walk down the street or, you know, declare my love or anything like that. I don't know. It feels like somewhat of a compromise and so. [00:29:00]
THERAPIST: What are you compromising?
CLIENT: Oh, I don't know. I mean I appreciate him a lot and yeah, I guess, I mean it's nothing negative. It's just that as I'm leaning and I felt more positive about this on Saturday. I just had a better day, I guess. (laughter) [00:30:00]
THERAPIST: Are you compromising your values, your wishes, your dreams?
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess. I mean, like, I guess the hope of finding someone more emotional. You know?
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:32:00]
CLIENT: But... (pause) Yeah. I shouldn't say it's a compromise. It's kind of a very bad thing to say. If Chris heard it, he would be so upset.
THERAPIST: You don't think he'd know?
CLIENT: I hope not. He's not very perceptive in these things.
THERAPIST: That's good.
CLIENT: (laughter)
THERAPIST: Thank God.
CLIENT: (laughter) Well, he's not. What can I say?
THERAPIST: And, how do you think he thinks about your involvement with Victor (sp?)?
CLIENT: He doesn't think about it. I mean yeah, that's, and I constantly bring, I mean at certain times. Not recently, but previously I would bring it up too much and he would just be, you know, very frustrated, but if I don't bring it up, you know, he's not thinking about it at all. So, I don't know. ","P1-N4009F1":"I mean aren't men really good at compartmentalizing and stuff? So, maybe that's what he has done. Yeah. [00:33:30]
THERAPIST: I was going to say he's man, not an idiot.
CLIENT: (laughter) What? No, he's not an idiot. I would not say that. I mean he, no, that's not it. I get to ride him too much. I think that's very bad. I call him stupid and idiot and all that, but really what I'm saying is that he's just so focused on his work that he doesn't notice a lot of things ","P1-N400A51":"around him. Like, I threw him a surprise birthday party and we were living together in a little, tiny apartment and he was like working right there and I was like right here in the kitchen. Cooking, cooking, cooking. I just, yeah, he didn't even notice. Maybe once he said what are you doing and I said ","P1-N400A52":"oh, you know, just making a nice meal for ourselves. For the two of us. You know? He said okay and went back to his studying. So, that's what I think of him as, you know, not very sharp, not very perceptive because he's so focused and I don't mean to take advantage of that by, you know, constantly cheating ","P1-N400A53":"on him or anything, but I could take advantage of it to surprise him. You know? [00:35:15]
THERAPIST: Well, I'm not quite, bothering him with it. What does that mean?
CLIENT: Well, and I always and this way might be lessening a bit now that I'm feeling a little better, but that's my kind of modus operendi. That is what I feel like every time I go to him. It feels like I'm bothering him and taking him away from work. [00:36:15]
THERAPIST: Well, if you're telling him what's on your mind is taking him away from work, why do you think he wants to be in a relationship with you? Why wouldn't he just see that as a distraction?
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. He says he likes me and loves me and wants me to be in his life because I make things better. So. Yeah. That doesn't involve too much talking, I guess. Well, I mean I don't know. Things are better with him than they would be with someone else. That's for sure. I mean they ","P1-N400AF1":"just, this weekend, we were taking a walk and all of a sudden I remembered something about my dad and that really pissed me off and I got very angry. [00:37:30]
THERAPIST: What would not working out look like?
CLIENT: What do you mean? [00:39:00]
THERAPIST: When you say not work out, what do you mean?
CLIENT: I don't know.
THERAPIST: On whose part, I guess?
CLIENT: Both our parts. (pause) I don't know why I said that. Well, I guess I meant like I might realize that I guess we've really exhausted all that there was to talk about. You know, or the things that we shared have kind of have come to kind of an end. That we've changed or he really wants someone ","P1-N400BD1":"more vibrant or more politically active or more academic. [00:40:00]
THERAPIST: Has he expressed that?
CLIENT: Kind of. Yeah. I mean when we've talked about you know, like, what we see the other person lacking. (pause) I think we're both very clingy, so it's hard to break up. (laughter)
THERAPIST: That's one of the first things that you guys talked about when you came in as a couple.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Is it simply sort of familiarity that is keeping you together? [00:41:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. That's the case, but it's very good familiarity. It's not like my old, you know, like more familiar brand of butter or something. It's more than that. There's a lot of affection there. Concern and love, so, you know. And, trust, you know, by what I did. So.
THERAPIST: I do think when I think about the two of you as a couple, there's definitely a stuckness to it. You guys are kind of in a holding pattern.
CLIENT: Yeah. Did you say that negatively? [00:42:00]
THERAPIST: Is being stuck ever positive?
CLIENT: Okay. (laughter) I'm hoping.
THERAPIST: I mean when you said it's negative. Let me turn it around. How is stuck being positive?
CLIENT: Well, you're stuck, that means you won't fall off. You're like solid-ish.
THERAPIST: That's interesting. Very interesting interpretation.
CLIENT: Well, you know. There's some solidity to that. You're not floating away or something. (laughter) I don't know.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean I guess that's very interesting and my thought to that is maybe there's a feeling on your part that that's the only way that you can feel secure is if you're stuck.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because you're absolutely right. I mean stuck. I think stuck typically has a negative connotation, but there is certainly that aspect of it. That there is stability. You're stuck to something. You aren't going to fall off of something. Absolutely. [00:43:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But, on the flip side, by definition stuck inhibits growth. There is no possibility for movement or growth.
CLIENT: Yeah. But, you have to be sure what direction you want to go, right?
THERAPIST: That's true, but even if you're sure or even if you have a sense, it's hard to do so if you are stuck.
CLIENT: Yeah. No. I see that. I'm saying that I might not even know where I want to, what part of me I want to grow.
THERAPIST: Right. Right. So, that's, so I was thinking about you as a couple. Right? That was a comment.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And, for you, I don't necessarily, I see you as a couple as stuck, but I don't see you in particular as stuck. I mean there's a stuckness to it, but there is also something going on internally and externally in terms of you're having conversations. We're having conversations together. Where ","P1-N400EF1":"you're trying to understand more about what being different or going a different path would look like and what it would mean. So, I don't actually see, I do see a piece of you is stuck, but I wouldn't actually describe you as stuck. [00:44:10]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Specifically or sort of as a general comment as much as I would describe your relationship as stuck.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because it's literally like not going. Almost like by route of it not going in any direction it just kind of goes like this.
CLIENT: You mean the relationship?
THERAPIST: Yeah. You move out. You move back in. You do this. You do that. But, it basically stays in the same space. I mean that's really how I think about it.
CLIENT: Like what would be unstuck? What would that look like?
THERAPIST: Well, I guess one more sort of obvious is like deciding whether or not you are going to be together or not.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Whether you're going to get married. Whether you're going to make a commitment. Moving in together and not telling anybody is stuck. That's just a version of not doing anything. [00:45:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: We're going to do something different, but we're not going to say that it's different. And, if you sort of, if you do something but don't identify to something different is it even something different ultimately? I mean, in your mind, it's sort of a variation of the same thing or at least ","P1-N401071":"hoping to keep it that way. So, even movement is described as the same thing as stuck.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: We need to stop for today. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to end so abruptly. Thank you for coming in a little earlier.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I appreciate it.
CLIENT: No problem.
THERAPIST: And, I will see you on Wednesday.
CLIENT: At 9:00?
THERAPIST: At our regular time, yes.
CLIENT: Okay. Have a good day.
THERAPIST: Okay, take care.
CLIENT: Bye.
