DESCRIPTION: Client discusses having to be in control and with a specific plan, or risk feeling empty and restless. Client also discusses displeasing her parents by not living up to their professional expectations.
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in. (pause) Hi.
CLIENT: Hi.
THERAPIST: How are you?
CLIENT: Good. I actually am doing pretty well this week. I had a pretty good week. I started just getting outside more and kind of trying to exercise a bit more. Which I found has helped me a lot mentally every day. So I have almost been trying to do something every day when I can kind of, you know, ","P1-N400111":"fit it in or try different ways to fit that in. And I found that mentally that has actually really helped me a lot this week. [00:01:08]
THERAPIST: Uh huh. Is there association between being low energy and thinking negatively?
CLIENT: There is, actually, for me. Like if I am really tired and just kind of want to sit on my couch. It is almost when I am bored is when the negative thinking actually happens for me I have noticed. Because a lot of times if I don’t have a lot of stuff planned for the weekend and there is ","P1-N400191":"kind of periods of down time, that is when I have noticed I kind of get into these downward spirals of like a little bit of the depression and stuff like that.
THERAPIST: Mm hm. Is it hard for you when you have time that is not structured?
CLIENT: (laughs)
THERAPIST: Tell me about it.
CLIENT: I think it has a lot to do with control. Like this morning before I left the house I made a list of things that I wanted to accomplish today when I got home. And I need to be able to, you know, cross everything off the list and feel like I got all of this stuff done. So it is actually really ","P1-N400231":"hard for me to just sit and be. And if I am reading I am fine. So I actually have tried to start reading more.
THERAPIST: Do you feel like, is it a restlessness? Do you feel kind of empty and lonely?
CLIENT: Um. Yeah, I guess more of a restlessness. I am okay with being alone but I have to be doing something, I guess. So I am fine if I am on my own but I guess I only have these kind of restless thoughts. If I am not doing anything it is hard. It is hard to explain but I need to feel in control and ","P1-N4002B1":"accomplished. And if I am just not doing anything I feel like, you know, a waste. [00:05:41]
THERAPIST: Have you always been like that?
CLIENT: I think so. I have tried to think back because I do remember as a kid I did spend a lot of time kind of on my own. But I was always reading a lot. So I think it was probably, you know, I was sort of doing that kind of stuff. I never really, I guess, watched a lot of TV or anything. [00:06:58]
THERAPIST: Versus what? Versus being out of control?
CLIENT: Yeah, or just useless, I think, more. Like I guess out of control. So out of control to me sort of means not accomplishing anything. It is not, you know, it is a little different. It is not like, you know, total chaos but it means not accomplishing anything or not doing anything with an end result.
THERAPIST: Does it make you feel more valuable? Is that part of it?
CLIENT: Probably. I think that is part of it because I think to me, yeah, I need to be able to keep my house clean, keep up the school work, also read extracurricular stuff, do x, y and z. And that makes me feel better as a person. Or I worked out so I am more valuable, I am a better person today because ","P1-N400471":"I did that. [00:10:50]
THERAPIST: This is not all of it. It is more complicated than this. But it almost seems like kind of a focus that will get you away from what you are feeling. I know that it produces a kind of feeling too. [00:11:59]
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: So that is not quite it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But it seems like it is kind of a focus on something outside of yourself, outside of what is going on inside.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, in a way I can see that. I mean, but like you were saying it also produces this good, really positive feeling where it kind of makes me feel more whole, I guess. From being able to do all of these different things. And I also, I self-identify with doing well in school or being a ","P1-N400571":"reader or walking outside.
THERAPIST: Sometimes I ask questions and sometimes I sort of just want to see where your mind goes.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: Which is why I am -
CLIENT: (laughs)
THERAPIST: I am not intentionally trying to (cross talking at 00:14:36).
CLIENT: Yeah. Okay.
THERAPIST: But, yeah, sometimes I just like to sort of see what emerges and sort of work with that.
CLIENT: Yeah. No, that makes sense because I am able to kind of think things through on my own, I think. But, like I said, my mind kind of races. (laughs) So yeah, I pretty much feel like I am thinking or my mind is racing to different places all the time. It is really hard for me to still my mind or ","P1-N4006D1":"just be. Which is why doing a passive activity is really hard for me.
THERAPIST: I started thinking about therapy as a passive activity. Like where you just are and see what happens or what emerges.
CLIENT: It is hard. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Yeah. It is certainly not structured. I mean there is a structure to this for sure but then within the space there is not a lot of structure.
CLIENT: It is hard. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Like I have a really hard time if I am out with other people that aren’t very extroverted. And if there is silence it is really, really, really hard for me because it is hard for me to just sit there. Because the whole time, if I am with the other person, I am thinking, “Why is so ","P1-N4007B1":"and so being quiet? Are they being quiet because they didn’t like what I just said? Maybe I should say something else.”
THERAPIST: So this will be an interesting exercise.
CLIENT: (laughs) Yes. Yeah. (pause) Yeah because I think that I know a lot of people use meditation and stuff as a really good mindfulness technique. And I have always been afraid to try it because I don’t know how to take to something like that. And I know that you have to practice. (laughs) ","P1-N400811":"But, yeah, it is just really, really I think difficult for me to feel happy or any sense of satisfaction if I am not actively thinking or engaging with something. (pause) [00:18:19]
THERAPIST: Well you could be actively engaging, just not with other people. You could be actively engaging with you mind, I guess. It is sort of a funny way to put it.
CLIENT: Yeah. That is true. That is a different way of thinking. Well, I mean, so I feel like (pause) Yeah, that is true. I guess I am always Because I was trying to think when I am reading maybe I am kind of actively engaging with my own mind but there is still some kind of a stimulation there. ","P1-N400851":"I am not alone.
THERAPIST: Are the evenings the time where you spend with your boyfriend?
CLIENT: Yeah. Like we will usually have dinner together or something and that is really good. But a lot of times he also needs a little He is very introverted or more introverted than I am. So he needs time after work, like a period of time, just to wind down and kind of, you know, be alone. Which ","P1-N400971":"he is totally okay with.
THERAPIST: More so than you used to?
CLIENT: Yeah. I would say maybe in the past year, though, I started doing them. Like I didn’t really used to make lists. But I will, you know, make a list of everything that has to be done and I have to cross everything out. And then if I have, like a lot of times if I have down time too I like ","P1-N400A31":"to take the time to plan. So I will plan out, you know, I will do meal planning or I will plan out when I am going to do different chores or when I do different work.
THERAPIST: Or else?
CLIENT: (laughs) Or else, I mean So I have tried to think about how I will react if I get a grade that isn’t an “A” on an exam or something. Because I know that I just punish myself really badly for things like that. So I am sure it will maybe happen this semester (laughs) because ","P1-N400AD1":"I am taking really hard classes. But I think I just feel like a failure.
THERAPIST: I have a couple of thoughts that came to my mind. I mean one way of thinking about sort of needing to have order is that there is something that feels not ordered inside.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: You know, and so it is a way of It is kind of an externalization, to use a kind of clunky word for -
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: like of something that is going on inside that can’t be managed.
CLIENT: Mm. Mm hm.
THERAPIST: And I was thinking about that and I was thinking also about, you know, people have experiences and those experiences feel very true. They may not quite fit the situation but there is some truth to it.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: The idea that, you know, there is this feeling you have of being a failure.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: And worrying about being a failure and needing to compensate for it.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: And it gets sort of played out in all these different ways in your life.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: But there is some truth to it inside. There is something maybe deeper about this feeling or fear that is maybe old and maybe has a history to it. And so I was thinking about that. [00:32:51]
CLIENT: Oh, I mean, there definitely could be, there definitely is a history of it, I think. And it absolutely could be from stuff way in the past. Because, I mean, as a kid I was always considered to be smart until in fourth grade there was some exam that we all had to take to be in some special program ","P1-N400DD1":"where you have to leave school. And I didn’t do well on that exam and so then I couldn’t be in that gifted group.
THERAPIST: I am sorry. I didn’t mean to interrupt.
CLIENT: No I am just saying, I mean, I just always needed to self-identify as something and whatever it is I have to be really good at it.
THERAPIST: Mm hm. Well it made me think about when you use the word “recognize.” I started thinking about, you know, how we have begun to sort of talk about your relationship with your Mom.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: And how there was a failure of recognition. That what she saw you as is just an extension of her.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: And not recognizing you in your own right. [00:37:44]
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: And so here you are trying to create an identify for yourself that is uniquely yours but that has some drawbacks to it in terms of the toll it takes on you. (laughs)
CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah.
THERAPIST: But it is sort of a way of creating an identity. And in lieu of not having sort of that kind of recognition maybe of you as sort of your own person.
CLIENT: That makes sense. Because I mean, so I always think I have tried to strive to figure out who I am and what I actually enjoy and, you know. And so actually, I mean, for me the first sort of, or what I thought was the first sort of accomplishment in terms of going back to maybe something I enjoyed ","P1-N401011":"or who I was, was overcoming the fear of studying science.
THERAPIST: That makes a lot of sense.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: I mean what you describe I mean there is a lot of ways in which what you were describing with your Mom would sort of have negative impact on you. And I am sure there is a lot good in your relationship too, so I appreciate that. [00:41:38]
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: No relationship is all bad.
CLIENT: Right. (laughs)
THERAPIST: But one of the problems in what you described is not really, A, not feeling someone is curious about who you are and then also just this confusion.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: Are you just, you know, to what extent are you being You know, is an image being, or a set of who you are is being imposed on you.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: And to what extent is it really a reflection of who you are.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it is confusing.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean and a big example of that too would be religion because that has been very confusing for me. Because my Mom made me teach religion classes to kids and do all this stuff at church and just imposed this whole thing on me that I just followed because that is what I was told to do. ","P1-N401291":"And I have been, part of me feels like this guilt about not wanting to be Catholic or follow the same religion as her, and part of me feels this total confusion over the whole issue. [00:42:56]
THERAPIST: I can totally see that.
CLIENT: Mm hm. Yeah, so. I mean that is one area where I have really been able to identify what is going on and I still feel really confused. But I can see what has been going on. But I think that subconsciously it has happened in every area of my life, really. And it is really hard to figure out what ","P1-N401311":"you want or who you are or what you enjoy and believe when there have been so many years, and really formative years that were spent just being told, you know, “You are this and you should do this and you are good at this.” (pause) Yeah. (laughs) [00:45:07]
THERAPIST: Why were they negative about your career change?
CLIENT: Because I was leaving a job where I was making a lot of money but I was really unhappy. And they felt that that was a bad decision because I was going into a field where I wouldn’t make a lot of money and going to be spending a few years not making any money. And so they thought that was ","P1-N401391":"a very bad decision. [00:46:21]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And so what I tried to stress was, for me, being happy and fulfilled means so much more. And I just need to do this now and it is really important to me. And it took a long time for me to get them on board. And there was other people that were really negative towards me about it too. Like the ","P1-N4013D1":"president of the college I went to said, “Why don’t you just become a pharmacist. They make more money. Why are you?” And he is a priest. (inaudible at 00:46:54) (laughs) You know?
THERAPIST: We are going to need to stop for today.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: But let’s pick this up next week.
CLIENT: Okay. Definitely.
THERAPIST: Did my assistant, I want to make sure, did she send you anything? Statements or anything?
CLIENT: No. That is what I was going to ask you because I think there is a form I need to fill out for Blue Cross.
THERAPIST: Right. So you should, what you will get from her is just sort of a co-pay statement.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Yeah. So usually at the end of the month people pay me. You know, like we just do monthly invoices.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So you will get a co-pay statement and exactly, she will give you a statement to submit to your insurance.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And I think it is on their website there is a form to fill out. You have to fill out very little of it. Almost all of it is on the statement. Like you just have to fill out I think your member ID and your name and your address.
CLIENT: Oh. Okay.
THERAPIST: And then everything, you just attach to the statement.
CLIENT: Just attach everything and send it in to them.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay. Great.
CLIENT: That makes sense.
THERAPIST: Okay. Great. So I will see you next week.
CLIENT: Thank you. Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay. Take care.
CLIENT: You too.
