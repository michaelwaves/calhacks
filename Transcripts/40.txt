DESCRIPTION: Client discusses his wife's hospitalization and treatment. Client discusses the difficulty of supporting someone who is depressed and how to handle visitation from family members.
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in. I'm just going to get some water. (pause) I'm really sorry about that. I mixed up the weeks. So I apologize.
CLIENT: It's really okay. I just went and got groceries. I usually do that afterwards. Doing it before was not a problem.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: But thank you.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: So Tanya is back in the hospital. I guess I haven't seen you while she was out because she got out last Thursday afternoon. Her sister was in town from Tuesday through Sunday. So that was good.[00:01:17]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: (pause) We talked with the ECT doctor yesterday after her, I guess, seventh round of the ECT. And he said that it was not that unusual to have a patient seem like the ECT was working inpatient and then leave the hospital and it seemed to sort of stop working. Which has sort of been the case here.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: I think that's probably about right. Certainly her mood is still very reactive. So Thursday, the first day she was out for a whole day, she was supposed to go see her outpatient psychiatrist who ended up having the flu. But she, and her sister escorted her, went out to the office and no one ","P1-N4001F1":"was there. [00:02:32]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And that was not particularly good for her emotionally. And she didn't really recover Thursday. I mean she was stable but very, very sad for the rest of the day really. Then had another round of the ECT Friday morning and was better. So then her mood kind of dropped off over the weekend and ","P1-N400231":"it was a long weekend.
THERAPIST: What happened that Monday?
CLIENT: I guess Sunday her sister left and then some time in the evening, her sister left round noon, and then some time in the evening she just started to get very depressed and somewhat suicidal. So she eventually called Chad.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: They talked for a little while. They made an appointment for Monday morning with a kind of "I'll be safe until this point," plan that we had talked about before. Went to that meeting, still was not doing very well. Basically sat in a chair all day Monday. [00:04:50]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Alternately staring into space and reading a book. So in a sense she was safe. But she's alive now, so I guess she was safe. But it was (pause) not an ideal circumstance, I don't think.
THERAPIST: Where were you while she was doing that?
CLIENT: In the apartment, around. Her sister helped us move our remaining items out of storage so everything is in our apartment now. But some of it needs to be put away. So I was just putting things away, unpacking.
THERAPIST: Mm. Do you read during that time? Do you work? What do you do while she's like that?
CLIENT: It varies. Sometimes I just sit with her just to be present. Not that I can really hold her hand or something. Not that I can really share her pain, but I can at least be there. Sometimes I read. It's hard to work during that time. It's just (pause) her being in acute distress sort of makes ","P1-N4003D1":"it hard focus enough to do work for any period of time. [00:06:20]
THERAPIST: What does it feel like when you sit with her?
CLIENT: I'm not sure I have the right words. It feels like she's monumentally sad and there's nothing I can do about it, but at least I'm there. (pause) I guess I'm sad that she is sad and I'm sad there's nothing else I can do. (sigh, pause) But I don't know that I'm really thinking about those in the ","P1-N400431":"moment. (pause) I don't know. I'm kind of there. (long pause) [00:09:42]
THERAPIST: You know, one thing I think we haven't talked about very much is how you think about her depression. Whether you think about it as a disease. Yeah, how do you think about it?
CLIENT: That's a good question. I do think of it as an illness.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: (pause) Disease has a complicated range of connotations. I don't know that I would usually think about it in that term, but definitely illness. [00:10:59]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: We have a couple of times, you and I, have talked about the situation by analogy to other illnesses, particularly of a chronic nature.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And that's something that I have done for some time as a way of trying to find some perspective on where I am and where she is. If you had this instead of depression, we would do this. So we should look for something similar in terms of what we do. The roadmap just seems more clear for cancer ","P1-N400551":"somehow. I'm not sure that's actually true but it seems like it from where I sit.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: That use her and use her mental processes, but are in a sense self preserving for the depression, not for her.
THERAPIST: Mm. (long pause) What are you thinking about?
CLIENT: I'm thinking about whether that was a complete answer to the question or not. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And I'm not sure that it is. I also think about what are the causes, because in the illness world there is more or less a cause for things. Cancer being an interesting parallel because we don't have very clear You know, the state of Louisiana knows a lot of things cause cancer, but it's not ","P1-N400631":"really clear what caused any specific cancer in any specific person, most of the time. Maybe smoking, lung cancer is clear. [00:13:28]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: A lot of yelling in her childhood. A lot of instability. Her mother leaving. That left, in a sense, a real vulnerability that has been played upon heavily in recent years. And then here we are. [00:14:41]
THERAPIST: Mm hm. Do you see her as powerless over this?
CLIENT: (pause) No, I really don't. I think she sees herself as powerless over it in a lot of ways, but I really don't.
THERAPIST: I guess with that do you feel that she could be doing something more?
CLIENT: (sigh, pause) This week, no. (laughs) I have definitely felt that way before. I think it's not an uncommon way to, having talked with other people who have family members who are depressed, I think it's not an uncommon reaction to it. [00:15:38]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: Because it just seems like, "Well if you would just do this different thing." But not in the last week, no. I really think that (sigh, pause) Like still her outpatient psychiatrist did contact her by e-mail and by phone before the appointment last Thursday. But our phone was still off because ","P1-N400751":"she had been in the hospital up until the day before and so she hadn't turned it on because there hadn't been any obvious need to and he hadn't checked her e-mail.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: what she could've done. I think that fundamental idea behind all of these coping skills and CBT and DBT methods is that you can do something though.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: So if that's not true then we're just filling our mental health patients with a whole lot of fluff and setting them up to failure. So I don't believe that.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And I don't think So I guess But then I ask this question of like, what does it mean that there is something more that you could have done? Does that mean that you are responsible for not having done it? Or does that just mean that there is another thing that you can try another time? [00:18:07]
THERAPIST: And it sounds like at times you have felt frustrated with her.
CLIENT: Oh sure. Yeah. Yeah. Particularly when I don't understand what's going on. You know, in the Fall there was a time that she just didn't go to work because she couldn't face it for reasons which never really became clear to me. It just was overwhelming or her somehow. [00:19:40]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: You said this week was different in terms of that in particular.
CLIENT: In terms of like how I felt at least. I didn't feel like I guess there's two ways in which it was different. One, I wasn't surprised to see her mood decline over the course of the weekend. Yeah, her mood had declined over the course of the previous weekend between two ECT treatments. So Saturday ","P1-N4009B1":"of last week, not a couple of days ago but the previous week, she had been more or less okay and then Sunday just not really that good. Not doing very well. [00:21:50]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: Which I don't think is correct. But I don't think it's correct because she doesn't meet the criteria in the DSM for a personality disorder. She has like six or seven of the symptoms for borderline personality disorder. But you have to, as I understand it, you have to meet the personality disorder ","P1-N400A31":"requirement first and then you can diagnose down. She doesn't meet that.
THERAPIST: I was going to ask. That was one of my questions about what you imagine was so devastating for her in him not coming?
CLIENT: It is a her.
THERAPIST: Her not coming. Sorry.
CLIENT: What I imagine, although I really haven't actually gotten much out of Tanya about it, is that it just, it's very much like when as a child her father would just show up late for picking her up for something. Or her mother left. It's kind of in that same vain of. "Here's someone that I need to ","P1-N400AD1":"rely on not being there. And I really need them right now."
THERAPIST: I think that would probably be more your feeling. Like, in knowing you.
CLIENT: (laughs)
THERAPIST: That that would be a way that you thought about it.
CLIENT: Fair enough. (laughs) But I think there is a reason that Tanya and I have gotten along well though. I think there is a sense in which she does also need a plan, more than she admits.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: She grew up in this family like, I was talking with her sister, and her sister said, "Yeah, no, the plans never go through. Nothing ever is going to happen." Which I think is somewhat of a conversation you and I had about how I was dealing with this. And I think that was hard for Tanya as a ","P1-N400BB1":"youth and I think still as a young adult when I met her. [00:25:40]
THERAPIST: In reading over the criteria for borderline personality disorder and seeing some of the characteristics, you know, what are your thoughts about that or feeling about that?
CLIENT: Well my first feeling was that Frederick really likes ECT and diagnosing BPD. Because she did (laughs) an outpatient program at Frederick after her second hospitalization so, I don't know, fourteen months ago, and the psychiatrist there wanted to diagnose her with BPD. At the time her response ","P1-N400C11":"was just, "No, I don't have any of these emptiness feelings ever." But that's kind of one of the characteristic traits. It's really not. [00:26:54]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: She sees her mother as a very broken and draining person and she doesn't want to be that person. I didn't have any of Like I don't have any stigma of that kind or of any other attached to it. I don't know.
THERAPIST: Mm hm. (pause) I was thinking of something you said a few weeks ago. I think I just pointed out that you were sort of hopeful that, you know, providing her with structure or a job would make a difference. And this sort of calls into question that, in the sense that it just seems like her ","P1-N400D11":"functioning is so poor right now that it's unclear what kind of structure at least would help right now.
CLIENT: (laughs) Right.
THERAPIST: And you had said, yeah, I mean, you know you wanted he to apply for jobs and if you could find a way to apply for a job with her, for her, you would do it. Although you couldn't really figure that out. And I was thinking about that sense of responsibility for her. Like in your thinking that ","P1-N400D51":"you wished you could apply for jobs for her. [00:29:58]
CLIENT: (long pause) Yeah. So I care about her a lot, so that gives, in my mind, that carries some obligations. I also made a set of vows to her that also carry some obligations. And so, yeah, I do think I have responsibilities to and for her. [00:30:51]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: So I was co-captain of the volleyball team in college, and by the time I graduated (laughs) I ended up having most of the officer positions in the organization. I didn't want most of them but I would sort of start doing pieces of them as other people dropped them. And then I would end up with ","P1-N400E11":"the whole roll.
THERAPIST: That's really an interesting parallel analogy or just sort of thought. Huh. Do you think in that case, was it sort of anxiety that you led you to do that? [00:34:20]
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Like that I need to do this otherwise they're not going to get done?
CLIENT: (sigh) Hm. (pause) Maybe. (pause) Yeah, maybe. There was also a real sense in which (pause) there was kind of a set number of things that needed to get done in that case, and that no one (laughs) really wanted to do. So if (pause) Yeah, so there were definitely cases where if I didn't do it, ","P1-N400EB1":"it didn't happen. [00:35:46]
CLIENT: Yeah, maybe there was some anxiety there. There was also a sense in which (sigh, pause) Yeah, so there was some anxiety about giving up some of the roles, I think, in that I thought that if I gave them up the next person would not do the job as well. [00:37:01]
THERAPIST: Mm. (pause)
CLIENT: Yeah. I'm not sure. I need to think about that more, I think. In that sense though, I'm not sure where the analogy would go. [00:38:20]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: Because there my concern would be towards kind of the functioning of the organization.
THERAPIST: Oh I think the analogy is a perfect one.
CLIENT: Okay. (sigh)
THERAPIST: You know, this concern may be, like the worst case scenario is everything would fall apart. The organization would cease to be. (laughs) I think there's a lot of analogy. Like Tanya (inaudible 00:38:42).
CLIENT: (laughs) Fair enough. Okay.
THERAPIST: Things falling apart. Who is going to be able to pick up the responsibility if you aren't? (long pause)
CLIENT: Now I feel like have to tell you the rest of that story, because So I graduated in 2007, and then I stayed for another year to do a degree because I was doing research with a guy that I really liked. And in that year our 87 year old volleyball coach drove into a tree killing himself and one ","P1-N401071":"of the players on the way to a volleyball meet.
THERAPIST: So you saw?
CLIENT: Oh yeah. Yeah.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: Yeah, that was not a good time. It was not a good time. (sigh) But since the coach had been doing a whole lot of the other important things for the team and then there was obviously this very large hole. Things had fallen apart in some sense. So, you know, after several months of kind of just ","P1-N401111":"limping along, I sat down with the officers of the team then. Because I had no actual responsibilities then.
THERAPIST: Oh my God! What was that like to see that?
CLIENT: Oh. (laughs) I'm sorry. (pause) It's horrifying. There's this person that I loved very dearly and a car full of freshmen in college who are riding with him. And they were just driving along on a road that I've driven, I don't know, several hundred times because it was close to my house. When ","P1-N4011B1":"he just kind of veered off the road into a tree at seventy miles an hour, seventy-five. [00:42:24]
THERAPIST: What were you thinking?
CLIENT: I was thinking that it took a lot of, in some ways, similar roles then to what I do now in terms of there are a whole lot of people who wanted to know what was going on, how the boys in the hospital were doing. So I ended up doing a lot of those communication roles in that time. Which is something ","P1-N401211":"I do a lot of now of communicating, "How is Tanya today? Where are we?" I don't really know where that analogy goes. But a lot of similar roles.
THERAPIST: Yeah. One thought, sort of on a practical level, but sort of, you know, this more sort of deeper level is, you know Tanya's parents in this. Like are they taking on some roles? Where are they in this? [00:44:36]
CLIENT: (sigh) Um. (pause) So if I weren't involved I think Tanya's mother, I don't know what she would do. But Tanya's father and one or both of her siblings would be here like all the time. (pause) Tanya thinks she doesn't want that. (pause) Yeah, that's right. Tanya thinks she doesn't want that and ","P1-N401251":"so I end up more in the role of interfacing with them to communicate what's going on and So her father came up fourteen months ago and during that visit, that was good. [00:45:37]
THERAPIST: Well, you just told me what Tanya wants and you told me what Tanya's father wants. What do you need?
CLIENT: (sigh) Well the thing that I need is for Tanya to be well. And so I can't really have that. So I don't know that I have any other like, I'm not sure that I have another want here other than to take care of Tanya as best I can and function for the things that I have to do as best as I can. I ","P1-N4012D1":"don't mean that I can never have Tanya being well, I just mean that like right now that is not the case and is not going to be the case for some time.
THERAPIST: That was more my question.
CLIENT: Yeah. It would be helpful if Tanya wanted to see him, you know, forty percent as much as she wanted to see me. It would be helpful in the sense that I just wouldn't visit on some days. But that's not really the case.
THERAPIST: Well this is a continuing sort of conversation between us that has both sort of my advice giving -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: and also these deeper issues. I think the deeper issue is you're wondering what does it mean to be devoted? What do marriage vows mean? Are there limits to it? What does it mean to be devoted to another person? What point are you betraying that devotion? You know, in micro ways or macro ","P1-N401391":"ways. I think these are really sort of deep questions.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You're not the only one with profound needs right now. I mean that's interesting that I said that.
CLIENT: (laughs)
THERAPIST: I think in part because the two of you are aligned in a certain way. I think sometimes I get confused in my mind. Obviously you're not. You're in very different places. But sometimes I think there's a little bit of interchange. But Tanya is not the only one with profound needs right now.
CLIENT: (laughs) It is interesting that you said the other.
THERAPIST: I know. What did you think of that?
CLIENT: Uh.
THERAPIST: Maybe that's how you feel?
CLIENT: No. No, I do feel that way some. I do feel like her family and my family have profound needs to take care of us, and there's nothing they can do on some level. But that's also just a mirror of like there's not much I can do either. And so we're all in this position of wanting things to be better ","P1-N4014D1":"and not having anything to do. Given the flow of what you were saying, I thought you misspoke. [00:50:10]
THERAPIST: I did misspeak. You know, James, we are going to need to stop for today. So you know, I have you guys, you and you guys as 10:45, just to clarify the time.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I don't know if that was today.
CLIENT: Okay. Alright.
THERAPIST: I kind of went back and forth. I have it as 10:45 though.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: If that's okay.
CLIENT: That is just fine. I had thought it was 10:40 and so 10:45 is, yeah, that's fine.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: It's good to know.
THERAPIST: Okay. So I guess let's do a wait and see again.
CLIENT: James.
THERAPIST: I will see. This time is here.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And one or both of you will be coming.
CLIENT: Do you want it to be a different time next week?
THERAPIST: Oh, that's fine. No it's not a problem at all.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: It was just something idiosyncratic today and I mixed up the weeks.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: It's fine. Let's keep it this.
CLIENT: Alright. Alright.
THERAPIST: Okay. Very good. I'll see you next week.
CLIENT: Alright. Thank you.
THERAPIST: Okay.
