DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her self-esteem issues that flared up at a recent wedding. Client discusses the body image issues that began when she was a child.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in!
CLIENT: Oh, I have a question for you today. I got the bill from your assistant, but I didn't know how to pay it (like, how to go about making payment), because she didn't have any, there was just like, the statement and the insurance thing, but there weren't any instructions at all.
THERAPIST: She, so, in terms of paying me, you already paid me your co-pay.
CLIENT: Yeah, I gave you... all right, all right. You have that, okay. All right.
THERAPIST: Did you, did you pay, so you paid for the first session. Did you pay the co-pay yet? Maybe not. [00:01:00]
CLIENT: No, I... because you can just keep putting everything on the same card. That's totally fine. I just wasn't sure... yeah.
THERAPIST: Sure. So I'm happy to do that. (client affirms) Usually we do it at the end of the month. And in terms of the statement, do you know how to submit it?
CLIENT: She... do I have to go on insurance website for that?
THERAPIST: So, yeah. Sorry I didn't explain. So it's pretty straightforward. So on the insurance website, they have like all these forms. (client affirms) And there is the "Submit yourself" form (client affirms) and basically, this form that Kelly (ph) gave you has almost everything you need. I think ","P1-N4001B1":"on that (on the form), you just need to fill out like your name, address, and member ID. (client affirms) And then they ask like, code and all this other stuff. You don't need to fill that out. You just attach the statement.
CLIENT: Just attach the form, all right.
THERAPIST: Yeah. So, sorry about that. I'm sorry that wasn't more, that wasn't explained. So yeah. So they should have like, it's like probably on their home page or something.
CLIENT: Okay, it sounds easy. Okay.
THERAPIST: Were you alone or with your boyfriend at the wedding?
CLIENT: I was with my boyfriend, yeah.
THERAPIST: It's interesting you wouldn't have known he was there, from (chuckles) your story, the way you told it.
CLIENT: Yeah. It was, well... (sighs) I mean, I don't know what... (sighs) Well, so, we were having a really good time, and everyone was kind of like talking and stuff, but then I was out dancing with my friends and he doesn't really dance. So it was during this like, I'm with all of them, and then ","P1-N400331":"my friend that was getting married kept coming up to us and saying, "Everyone looks so great!" In my head, it was like, "Well she's really saying that everyone else looks great, and not me. She's talking about everyone else, and look at all of them, they look so great, and I just feel so, like dumpy ","P1-N400332":"and terrible." Then, I sort of got back to the table and sat down for a bit with my boyfriend. I was like processing (chuckles) all of this negative stuff that was going through my head, and then I kind of... Like we kind of left early, because I just couldn't be there. [00:07:54]
THERAPIST: So, do you have difficulty using him at those moments, to like calm you down or make you feel better or...?
CLIENT: Yeah, because I feel like it's a burden, because I feel like he was like, "Oh, great; this happen again!" So, obviously, he... he kind of knew what was going on, but not really. I felt like I couldn't say all of this stuff, because he would just think like, "Great; this is like happening again! ","P1-N400371":"It's another sign that you're, like have all these self-esteem issues. You can't have a good time, because of your self-esteem problems." So I guess I do have difficulty like using him, because I don't, I feel like, he's heard it so many times, he probably doesn't know what to say (chuckles) anymore, ","P1-N400372":"and it's just sort of me against my mind like, in it alone, I guess. [00:09:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean I guess there is sort of using him in the sort of verbal back and forth, and then there is sort of like, just feeling less alone in his presence (client affirms), having his presence somehow mediate that process. But it doesn't sound like it does.
CLIENT: No, because (sighs) it's sort of when I get so in my head that I don't even think of anyone else, like not, like, I don't even think of, where, almost like where I am. Like, it's, I'm so in my head, being so critical, and kind of like, that it doesn't help a lot to have like (chuckles) anyone ","P1-N4003B1":"ever around me, because it wouldn't matter if I was alone or with other people, I guess. It's sort of, I mean, it was good to have him there, in the sense that... you know, he kind of said, "Do you, you want to go? It seems like you're tired and this is kind of, you know, wearing on you. So let's..." ","P1-N4003B2":"So that was like, good. But, um, but (sighs) having him there doesn't help to turn my thought process around, once I'm already going down this like weird spiral of thinking. [00:10:23]
THERAPIST: (pause) It seems like you feel kind of constantly exposed. (client affirms) On stage, almost, but not in a good way.
CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah, yeah. It's kind of like... I was thinking about like, the size of my dress, and like... Actually, what really triggered it was, we were, people were taking pictures and stuff, and my boyfriend took a picture of all of us. I was kind of like leaning over, and I happened to see ","P1-N400411":"what that picture looked like. I thought I just looked so terrible. That's what like really started, because I thought, "Well, the way I look in that picture is the way that everybody else sees me, and they must be looking at me like... Who, you know, she's just gained so much weight," like thinking ","P1-N400412":"all this stuff. So, I actually forgot, that was sort of more like, the trigger, too, because I think I was already doing all of these comparisons in my mind, and then that really set it off. [00:12:40]
THERAPIST: In terms, I mean, you know your family well, but in terms of sort of classifying some group of friends as (client affirms), you know, safer and interested more in like kind of intellectual or (client affirms) deeper things. Do you feel it's largely, you know, for lack of better, like an accurate ","P1-N4004D1":"appraisal, or is there something that's going on that you kind of, put people into groups, with not sort of seeing all of their, you know, all the facts.
CLIENT: Uh... So... (sighs) I think that I put people into groups if, in a way, it's like, they've never exposed any flaws to me. So, I guess what I mean by that is, some of my friends might, I guess, look a certain way or be very put together; but at the same time, I know they've, they've been more ","P1-N4004F1":"vulnerable, or told me like different struggles, or different issues that they were having (especially people that I know that have like, had struggles with weight or different things). I always put them in the safe zone, because I think I feel like I can be more exposed in front of them, and they'll ","P1-N4004F2":"understand because they've been there, they've been through things. [00:18:28]
THERAPIST: Well, you also know your strengths.
CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) I don't always think of them.
THERAPIST: You got tearful when you said, "I don't always say no, I don't know how to say no to people."
CLIENT: Yeah. (sniffles) Because I feel like I don't have time for myself, because people are like, (sniffles) just constantly like asking me to do things. Which I mean, you would think it would be a good thing to have a lot of friends, but it's really hard. (sniffles) Sometimes, I feel like I just ","P1-N4005D1":"don't, I like want to say no and I just don't. I just want to like do stuff for myself, but I'm worried about what they'll say about me. (sniffles) So it's really, really hard for me to just say like, "No, I can't make that," because then I think that they're going to say like, "She can never make anything." ","P1-N4005D2":"Then I feel like they're going to talk about me and then, and I don't want... My biggest fear is always having people talk about me, because it's like I'll do anything to prevent that from happening. (therapist responds) [00:23:34]
THERAPIST: Well, it seems like you're operating under the assumption that what you have to give will always be less than what people want from you. (client affirms) And so there is some way in which you need to make up for that, if that's the case. (client affirms) Which is why it's like, either you or them.
CLIENT: Yeah, basically. And then, it's usually them. Like giving stuff for other people usually always wins out over just having quiet, like doing stuff for myself. And I'm so envious of people when I hear that they actually, you know, have their weekends to themselves to do things that they want to ","P1-N400691":"do or to relax, because I'm just constantly booking things and scheduling things and juggling my calendar to see where I can fit people in and it's (sighs) really tiring. It almost becomes that, you know, seeing friends or spending time with them, especially if it's certain friends, where like this ","P1-N400692":"one group where you don't actually want to be spending time with them. You're just, I'm just doing it so that they won't talk about me. It's sort of like, you're not having an enjoyable time when you're with them. [00:27:45]
THERAPIST: It's like you're punching a clock!
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah! It's like another job or something. So... I need to figure (chuckles) out how to be able to say no without having this guilt that, and this... And I think I also need it not be so worried about other people talking about me, because people talk about everybody. It's going to happen ","P1-N4006D1":"and I just need to get over it. But I think that's a big fear like, from childhood, though, because people were always making fun of me and talking about me. So that's, I think that fear is still always there. You never want someone to say something negative about you or talk negatively about you. And ","P1-N4006D2":"so, you're just always trying to make them happy. Like a lot of times, if I can't attend an event... Like I (sniffles) missed my friend's baby shower because I was sick, I sent like a bouquet of flowers and sent all this stuff, because I didn't want them to talk about me for missing it, even though ","P1-N4006D3":"I was really sick. So, I'm just always trying to do all of this stuff to keep everyone else happy and juggle all these different little bubbles, I guess, of people. It's (sniffles), it's kind of tiring. [00:29:11]
THERAPIST: It sounds like it. And when you say people, do people talk about you like, you know, they say, "Oh, Felicity didn't come." Like, what, I guess that's talking about you, but that's probably not what you're worried about. So what do you...?
CLIENT: No. (sighs) It's just... And it really is just these, I have one group of, I have some groups of girlfriends from college that are great, and then I have one group of girlfriends from college that... they just tend to talk about whoever is not there. And so, I always think that if I'm not there, ","P1-N400711":"then they're going to say, "She never comes to anything," because we have one friend that's a nurse. She's never able to come, you know, when we get together. And they say, "She never comes to anything, she clearly doesn't care. She's clearly not making an effort, we don't know what's wrong with her." [00:30:06]
THERAPIST: Did you have a hard time making friends growing up?
CLIENT: (affirms) Because I was just always a little bit different. Like, they either, people either made fun of me because of my weight (which, looking back, I really actually wasn't very overweight or overweight at all), but they would make fun of me because of that. Or I had like glasses and braces ","P1-N400791":"and everything, so they would just find anything to make fun of you for. I was really nerdy, so they would make fun of you for that. So I had a really hard time like, fitting in or finding people that I connected with.
THERAPIST: Because you don't feel confident in the friends that you do have? Is that, like everyone or...? [00:35:20]
CLIENT: No, at this point, I feel very confident. A lot of the friends that I do have and... It's just there is something still there that I don't want to make these other people unhappy. I don't want to end the friendship because I just, there is something in me that can't do that, that can't let things ","P1-N400831":"kind of like, drift away. I just always feel this obligation to all of these people. It's really difficult because, you know, I have college friends, grad school friends, friends from when I worked at grad school, friends from working over here, now friends from (inaudible). Like there are so many different ","P1-N400832":"groups of people and it's really exhausting. Some of them, I consider to be amazing people and such great friends, and that's really the kind of friendship I would want. [00:36:18]
THERAPIST: How do you think you went from that to like, feeling like no one likes you, now everybody has to like you?
CLIENT: Um... I don't... (sighs) I don't really... know. I mean, (sighs) I think maybe it was just this sort of gradual thing that started happening as I started, all of a sudden, making all of these friends and realizing that I had qualities that people liked, especially in college and stuff. And then, ","P1-N400891":"it... (sighs) I don't remember any particular time when that set in, except to say that maybe it set in as I started making more and more friends, there must have been some sort of transition that happened. [00:38:31]
THERAPIST: Is there the feeling like whoever is not your friend is your enemy? [00:39:27]
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, because it's automatically, if it was from... We're just not close anymore and we're not friends, so they must not like me. (therapist responds) So, yeah, it would be, they would be against me, or they would, yeah.
THERAPIST: I know that even as I say that, it sounds like even in the context of being friends, they're your enemy. They are looking at you, they are judging you (client affirms), you know, they're... I was, I thought about the expression of "keeping your enemies close" (client affirms). You need to ","P1-N400911":"keep them close, you need to watch them (client affirms), for fear of what they're going to do. You want to keep them, you want to make sure that they're under your watch.
CLIENT: Yeah, it's almost, it's basically like that for these, the one group from college and this one worker. It's, I just want to keep them happy and just so they won't go off and talk about me. I just don't know how to say no. It's that, and then it's stuff with, you know, not knowing how to say ","P1-N400931":"no to family and just feeling all this guilt. I just feel like I'm pulled in like, a million different directions, and I'm always juggling things and figuring out how to fit it all in. [00:40:47]
THERAPIST: (pause) Well, you have to keep careful watch.
CLIENT: (affirms) (chuckles) Yeah. Yeah, to make, it is just to make sure that everything is in place and nothing is falling (inaudible), you know. So, yeah, it's, it's... really tiring and almost makes you resentful of people in your life, too, which is not (chuckles) great. (sighs) I mean, it's a ","P1-N400991":"part of me knows that a really positive thing for me would actually be the letting go of some of these friendships; but another part of me also feels like, well, "Is that taking the easy way out, because I just don't feel comfortable around them, and I don't feel comfortable them because of my own body ","P1-N400992":"image issues, and should I figure out how to be comfortable around them anyway?" [00:43:08]
THERAPIST: Where does the resentment piece come in?
CLIENT: Um... I think whenever I do something for someone, or else that, or hang out with them when I didn't want to, I resent them (therapist responds) at the same time. So, it's sort of like, "Okay, I have to make all these phone calls to family, and I have to send all of these cards to people, and ","P1-N4009F1":"send these gifts, and do this and this and that." Then it, it's like, in a way, there is like a little bit of resentment like, (sighs) "I have to go to the post office and do this for this person! I have to do this!" It's like this obligation instead of really like, wanting to do something. It's more ","P1-N4009F2":"of an obligation, I mean I almost resent the person, just a little bit, because you're doing it. And no one told you, you had to, but to me, I have to (therapist responds) do all of these things. [00:44:33]
THERAPIST: That sounds very exhausting. (inaudible), just to stop for today, okay? I will see you next week?
CLIENT: Yeah!
THERAPIST: Okay, great!
CLIENT: Thank you!
THERAPIST: Take care!
CLIENT: Thanks, (inaudible).
