TITLE: Client "C" Therapy Session Audio Recording, December 11, 2012: Client discusses conflict within his family due to his upcoming wedding.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses conflict within his family due to his upcoming wedding.
CLIENT: January 15th I start classes for my dad's business, and they're every Tuesday, Thursday from 6:00 to 9:30. Then I got to get to Hamden. So I don't know, I'm in a dilemma because I still have soccer too, and it goes till May. And I don't really want to terminate treatment, but I don't know if ","P1-N4000B1":"there's any other time we can meet, because I have soccer Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and occasionally on Friday. So I just-I'm at an imbalance there.
THERAPIST: And what are your regular work hours?
CLIENT: I work-well, I just came from a job interview.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: So depending on if I change jobs, my hours right now are 7:30 to 3:00. They'd be 7:30 to 2:45, 3:00, yeah.
THERAPIST: So the only time you have is Tuesday afternoon.
CLIENT: No, I mean, I could do Monday afternoon at like 4:00. You know, I could do Wednesday, anywhere up to 5:30, 6:00 would be the absolute latest.
THERAPIST: In between what? Starting when?
CLIENT: Starting when I do those-
THERAPIST: No, I'm saying but when-so you'd be here between 3:00 and 6:00?
CLIENT: Well, no, 3:00 and 7:00. I can't do anything at 7:00 because I have soccer at 8:20.
THERAPIST: I see. So basically Monday afternoon and Wednesday afternoon.
CLIENT: Monday, Wednesday, because Tuesdays and Thursdays will be eliminated. And Fridays I can't commit depending-because I get my schedule monthly for soccer and I don't know if I have a game on Friday or not. [2:00]
THERAPIST: Do you have earlier in the day on Tuesday free? Like earlier in the afternoon I mean?
CLIENT: Like-
THERAPIST: Because I don't have-basically I'm teaching this course.
CLIENT: No, yeah, I know.
THERAPIST: But it's just till the end of January.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So that's what I'm saying, I could go back to our old time.
CLIENT: See, but I don't know if I can get there, because I have to get to Hamden for class by 6:00.
THERAPIST: I see. So you basically do this straight from work.
CLIENT: I have to go from work to here to class.
THERAPIST: Right, but I'm saying-so basically we're looking for something Monday or Wednesday afternoon it sounds like.
CLIENT: Monday, Wednesday right now. Potentially Friday, but I don't know.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: I can do later on Wednesday.
THERAPIST: See, I'm pretty booked right now Wednesdays, I don't have any openings.
CLIENT: Okay, you don't have anything on Monday?
THERAPIST: So Mondays-I may have something Monday afternoons in Amherst.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And I may have something in the early afternoon-you know, middle afternoon in Amherst that I might be able to do.
CLIENT: Yeah. Because I'm going to Foxboro Monday night at 7:40. So even if I left Amherst by 7:00 I could probably do like 5:30, 6:00 if that's available.
THERAPIST: But you couldn't do earlier?
CLIENT: I probably could.
THERAPIST: Okay. Let me take a look at my schedule.
CLIENT: I just want to throw that out there to you now.
THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. So this will be starting, I'm sorry, when?
CLIENT: January 15th is my first week of classes.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So the Tuesday, Thursdays will be totally eliminated. And Thursday is completely out, Tuesday is-I mean, if I can fit it in. See, the only time I can think I'd fit it in is 3:00, because I think 4:00 would be too late. 4:00 or 4:45, then have an hour to get from Darien to Hamden. I'm just trying ","P1-N4005B1":"to figure out with traffic and stuff like that. [4:00]
THERAPIST: Right. So let meSo we're not going to also-I'm happy to meet with you next Tuesday, and I don't know if you want that. So then a few Tuesdays are holidays too.
CLIENT: Yeah, because I was thinking the same thing, if we can meet next Tuesday.
THERAPIST: You want to meet next Tuesday. And then we're off two Tuesdays.
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: And then the following Tuesday-
CLIENT: Is the 8th.
THERAPIST: Okay, so you can do that.
CLIENT: I can do the 8th.
THERAPIST: And it's after that.
CLIENT: It's after that where-
THERAPIST: Well, I know that I can certainly do the 3:00 on Tuesdays during February, for your 3:15. It doesn't sound like that's ideal though.
CLIENT: I don't know when I can. I mean, because I get out of work now at 3:00, and then my other job I'll be getting out at 2:45. Potentially that could be in Wallingford, so I maybe could do the 3:15, but I don't-
THERAPIST: Well, I'm going to take-you know, I have your schedule in mind.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: It's going to be a little tight, but I'm going to see-
CLIENT: No, yeah, I just wanted to throw that out before we started.
THERAPIST: Sure, and I appreciate it. Okay.
CLIENT: Well, again, I am just-I had a major blowout last week with my mom. And it wasn't at her, it was just in general. Again, it's regarding my cousins and my aunt for the guest list. She told me that, you know, after my grandmother passed there was coins that were valuable, this, that and the other ","P1-N4007F1":"thing. And my dad has all my grandmother's jewelry and they were going to exchange them. And I don't know why my mother tells me this, I think she likes getting me all worked up and knows that it makes me really mad and angry. But she told me when they went to meet with my aunt and my uncle regarding ","P1-N4007F2":"the coins he just showed up with money, no coins, and said, "Here, this is what they were worth." And that's that. And that really set me over the edge, where I was, "Bullshit!" And told them now they definitely not invited, none of them are coming to my wedding, I don't want that. And my mother was ","P1-N4007F3":"like, "Well, I shouldn't have told you," this, that and the other thing. And I'm like, "No, obviously you wanted to tell me. You wanted to get me. Because I'm not having this anymore." I'm not putting up with their bullshit anymore. I don't want them doing this. Every time it's like they're sneaking ","P1-N4007F4":"stuff. You know, "Well, I went and did this," without me or my dad seeing anything. Same thing with the jewelry, my dad just puts up the jewelry with them. How is that-why is it that you have to be the nice guy buy he just takes all the stuff and sells it and just gives you a portion? We don't know ","P1-N4007F5":"how much he really got for it. We don't know how truly valuable they were. And it really pissed me off. And I hate to say it but I got the rage, I felt it in here and it built all the way up and it just exploded. And to be honest, even talking about it now I feel that sensation becoming in my stomach. [7:20]
THERAPIST: What does it feel like?
CLIENT: It feels like anger. It feels like my stomach is boiling. And it's just like-I take it back to like lava. I can just feel it rumbling and bumbling and it's just working its way up, to the point where it's just so uncomfortable that boom, I just explode. And I already feel like my head's starting ","P1-N400831":"to shake a little bit, my hands are starting to shake a little bit, because I'm just getting extremely, extremely angry and extremely worked up about it. And it really pisses me off, to the point where I can't even look or think about my aunt and uncle because there's this garbage that goes on over ","P1-N400832":"and over and over, and it's not going to change. And no matter how much I avoid or try to avoid it, whenever I hear about them I lose it, I get very, very angry. Because there's no positives coming out of it. There's nothing that I have to gain or nothing I want to gain out of a relationship with them. ","P1-N400833":"I want to move on from a relationship with them, I want them completely out of my life. And it just angers me I think because I can't. As long as I still have my dad I know I can't just eliminate them from my life, because he gets extremely upset. He gets very defensive, and he's the one who gets really ","P1-N400834":"mad. My sister and my uncle told me the other day that my dad was crying about the fact that I don't want his sister or her family out of my life. Crying, and why I don't understand.
THERAPIST: What would you like them to do?
CLIENT: Talk it out.
THERAPIST: With your aunt and uncle?
CLIENT: Everybody, all of us. Explain to me why you're not doing this, instead of avoiding me. Give me answers. Give me answers. I mean, it's to the point where why do I have to hear third person that my dad's upset that I'm not inviting his sister or our family. Why can't he have a conversation with ","P1-N4008F1":"me? That's the frustrating part. Why can't he and I talk one on one? When I have an issue with my mother's family why can't we talk one on one? I do have a problem that my parents do avoid a lot, a lot of issues that I feel-and this is me personally, I can't speak for my siblings-if we're addressed ","P1-N4008F2":"I would feel better about it. I would feel better about myself. However, I don't feel that. I don't feel that way. And I think that's what makes me so much more angry, so much more uncomfortable with myself and being associated with these people. I do feel that I'm looking for answers and I have nothing. ","P1-N4008F3":"I've asked the questions thousands of times and I've been avoided. I've never really gotten the concrete answer, I've never even gotten a concrete response. Or any type of response. All the response is, "Here, what can this buy? What can this buy to keep your mouth quiet for a little longer? What can ","P1-N4008F4":"this buy to get you to see things my way? What can this buy to get you to help you see things my way?" I don't like it, I don't want that. [15:10]
THERAPIST: Do you feel like they were provoking you?
CLIENT: No. I just-
THERAPIST: They were just ignoring you.
CLIENT: Not ignoring me, it's just the way they are. They don't see the hurt that they're doing. They don't seePut it this way, I feel like they're doing things that they normally do but don't understand the meanings of it towards me. You know? I feel like they just go through-honestly, they have ","P1-N4009B1":"a good heart, their hearts in the right place, they just do things out of the ordinary and don't think they'reTo be honest, I feel 100% in my heart they feel they're not doing anything wrong. They're really not. "Oh, who cares, we're paying for it, he's not gonna mind." I honestly feel that. And then ","P1-N4009B2":"when I confront them on it they don't process it. They don't, you know, see the end that I'm coming from. And that really pisses me off, because when I want to have a conversation about it I can't, because that's when I feel ignored. That's when I feel truly that they're not listening. Because when ","P1-N4009B3":"they talk to me they go, "Okay, we're doing this and this is fine." And I say, "No, we're not. This is not how we're doing things. You need to cut it down to what I told you you need to do." Because as far as directions go they're not very good at following them. They're really not. And then, you know, ","P1-N4009B4":"that shows me that they're not truly listening to what I'm saying.
THERAPIST: They were deaf to your pain.
CLIENT: Mm hm. They were. I feel that 100%. And it's very difficult to express that to them. It's very difficult to accept that. Because you don't want to-you always want-you know, you always want your parents to support you in whatever you do. You always want your parents to be involved in a lot of ","P1-N400A31":"the things that you like, and hopefully they'll like. But unfortunately I didn't get it to the satisfaction that I was craving, to the satisfaction that I needed. And that was very, very hurtful. And it still is hurtful, because the mentality is still the same. Their mentality has not changed. [22:00]
THERAPIST: Mm hm. You look sad.
CLIENT: I feel it. I do, I feel sad. I feel like everything that I've done has not been good enough. You know, everything I've done I've been part of a competition to be someone who just gets bragged about. I mean, it was my education. You know, me and my sister and my brothers, "My kids graduated college. ","P1-N400A91":"Two of my kids have master's. My daughter's going for her Ph.D. My son's getting married." All these happy families [unclear 24:07]. My dad is gloating. To say, "Hey, see, this is how good my kids are, this is how happy my family is." And I just-I don't understand it. I don't understand it. Is my dad ","P1-N400A92":"proud of me? Maybe, probably, I don't know. Is he ecstatic that I'm getting in his business and my [noise] are all getting in the business? Absolutely. But who does that make happy? Who really approves? I mean, I'm happy [unclear] going into work and working with my brothers and my dad, but there's ","P1-N400A93":"that other part of me that I've already worked with family. I already see what can happen. [25:00]
THERAPIST: Your girlfriend?
CLIENT: Mm hm.
THERAPIST: Well, you have two, you have me too.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: You may have more than that, but you have at least two.
CLIENT: Thank you. Because that is comforting.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: It's comforting to know that I do have the support of [inaudible]. That I'm still searching for with the people that I've been so close to. And it's just-it's frustrating. It's just frustrating, because all my life I've felt like an outcast, I've felt beaten up and survived it, gotten back up. ","P1-N400BB1":"Beat down again, survived it, gotten back up. And I just don't know why I keep getting beat down. And the crazier question is why I keep getting back up and fighting. When most normal people would already have just given up and moved on. End of this fight. I mean, I don't know if it is a fight. I don't ","P1-N400BB2":"think it's a fight, but it's just hard to digest, it's hard to put into words. The feeling that I'm feeling when-to express myself through anger. But what I'm looking for is love. And it's not a monetary love, it's not an unconditional love, it's an empathetic love. It's a love that they can actually ","P1-N400BB3":"stand in my shoes and just a little bit feel what I'm feeling, just a little bit. And I don't feel that they even feel that love. I really don't. The love part is there, the unconditional love is there, but the empathetic, the putting yourself in my shoes for a little bit I feel that there's not. And... ","P1-N400BB4":"It's frustrating. Because after all this time that's the one thing that I've been looking for, is the empathy piece. Is the support, knowing that they can relate to the situation that I'm in, they can see my side of things, they can see where all this anger and all this abuse came from. And I don't-I ","P1-N400BB5":"guess that's why I'm there, I'm still searching for it. I guess that's why I keep fighting. I guess that's why I keep doing the best I can to have these conversations with them. To try to crack open the shell, to get in there, to make them feel that, you know, it is-this is how I feel, just listen to ","P1-N400BB6":"me. Just listen to me. And they don't get it. And they don't get it. [30:30]
THERAPIST: Which feeling was that?
CLIENT: Relaxation, calm. Clear in my head, the comfort of knowing that I was okay. The comfort of -basically it comes down to this. I was rejected again, and the best way I deal with rejection is turning to either food or drugs, because they will never reject me.
THERAPIST: You felt like your parents reject you in what they do? [32:00]
CLIENT: Mm hm, I do. They just reject my feelings. It's not that they reject me, they reject my feelings. Consistently reject my feelings. And this whole wedding process has solidified that, has made it more difficult, because everything that I'm doing and having them involved in, if I don't like it ","P1-N400C51":"they get upset and they don't understand way. And again, it goes to my feelings of being rejected, my wants, my needs being rejected. Everything that me and my fianc� want, it's heard but it's not, all that they hear are the words. They don't hear the feeling behind it, they don't hear the emotion ","P1-N400C52":"behind it, whether it be positive or anger. And that's what's frustrating to me. It's what's extremely frustrating to me, is because I do want them to empathize with me, to be in the shoes that I'm in. To walk in the feelings that I've walked through for all these years.
THERAPIST: How have you failed?
CLIENT: I guess I failed because I haven't gotten them to talk to me. That's how I feel I failed. I feel every conversation I had has not been effective. It hasn't. I failed, you know, multiple times trying to communicate with them. I've tried tons and tons of ways of crying out. Tons of ways of just ","P1-N400CF1":"trying to initiate it, initiate the conversation, and every way has been rejected. I feel like [unclear 41:27], you know, you have a project for your boss or whatever it is and he rejects. Or you have a school project and they say, "No, you've got to fix this, this, this and this." Well, I feel like ","P1-N400CF2":"I've tried to fix all this stuff, but it still comes back rejected because I didn't do a good enough job. I didn't do an effective job, I didn't do a more detailed job.
THERAPIST: But you're then attributing the job to how you communicate, not how they listen. [42:00]
CLIENT: That can be it too, I do have communication issues.
THERAPIST: But you're locating the fault in you.
CLIENT: Maybe it is me. I don't know. That's the one thing I'm trying to figure out, is if it is me or them. Am I the one who's being unreasonable? Am I the one who's being unrealistic? I don't know. I feel I'm not. I'm sure they feel I'm being unrealistic, they feel I'm being unreasonable. I kind of ","P1-N400D71":"feel like I am alone because right now I don't have anybody that supports me. Yourself and my fianc�. Those are the only two. But at times when people try to rationally talk to me that's when I get confused, that's when I get the guilt. That's when I get the uneasiness, like, yeah, you're right, ","P1-N400D72":"maybe I should just smile and let it me. But it's not the person I am. It's not the person I want to be. If I have an issue I want to confront it. I don't want to let it get out of control. I don't want to make excuses to not tackle it, to not address it now. I want to be that person that gets on it ","P1-N400D73":"now, that makes the stand, that tries to find a way to get it done. Because unfortunately I have been that person that put it on the backburner and waited and waited and waited. And when it finally came time to address it it's too late. It's too late, it's already ran its course, it's already infected ","P1-N400D74":"everybody. And there's no turning back, there's no taking back what happened in the past. It could have been nipped in the bud 25 years ago. Instead it was chose-it wasn't chose, it was decided to look past it, and to let it continue to infect and infect and infect and infect. And then when we're suddenly ","P1-N400D75":"trying to treat it and get rid of the virus, now the virus is pushing in [the heart? 44:40]. And it's frustrating.
THERAPIST: And you're not sure what to do.
CLIENT: And I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.
THERAPIST: Well, I'd like to help you figure it out. I think talking about it is a really good step.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: We do need to go for today, Jordan. So I'll see you-
CLIENT: Awesome, thank you very much.
THERAPIST: Okay, take care.
CLIENT: See you.
THERAPIST: Okay, good bye.
CLIENT: Bye.
