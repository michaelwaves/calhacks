DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her trips over the holiday season to visit her family and her girlfriend's family. Client discusses her anxiety over eating  and taking medicine, and how she's become a bit of a hypochondriac.
THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.
CLIENT: How are you?
THERAPIST: Good, I’m just going to grab some water.
CLIENT: Sure.
CLIENT: A lot of rearranging, huh?
THERAPIST: Yeah, I don’t know if you’ve been here since…
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: …I got some new furniture.
CLIENT: Yeah, it looks nice.
THERAPIST: Great, thank you.
CLIENT: I have a check for you that is late, so I’ll give it to you now.
THERAPIST: Oh, yeah, no worries.
CLIENT: Sorry about that.
THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:00:40)
CLIENT: Completely my fault.
THERAPIST: No worries, (crosstalk at 00:00:42).
CLIENT: I put both November on December on that one.
THERAPIST: All right, great. Thank you very much.
CLIENT: Yeah, sorry. Totally slipped my mind.
THERAPIST: Welcome back. [00:01:00]
CLIENT: Thank you. I don’t know when the last time we sat here, it was…
THERAPIST: Before you went away.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Probably a week or so before Christmas.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know. I don’t know what to…
THERAPIST: Where to start?
CLIENT: What to tell you about, yeah. Everything’s good. Yeah. I don’t have anything heavily weighing on my mind at the moment.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don’t know. [00:02:00]
CLIENT: I don’t know.
THERAPIST: Do you think the long break has something to do with it, not knowing where to start?
CLIENT: Yeah, maybe. I feel like in the last couple months, when something would happen, it would make me anxious or something like that. I file that away, talked to Dr. Feldman about that. [00:03:00] I don’t feel like I had many of those moments. I’m not not anxious, but there haven’t ","P1-N4004F1":"been any large events. I don’t feel like I’ve had any freak-outs. Yeah, I don’t know.
THERAPIST: Were you with your family over the holidays (crosstalk at 00:03:22)?
CLIENT: When we had the snowstorm, we were briefly with my family, just for a day or two, when we got back from Oregon. We were with Amelia’s family in Oregon for our vacation.
THERAPIST: They had to have known that you were bringing these particular foods for particular reasons.
CLIENT: I have no idea! I must have had—I think it actually concerned Amelia, a little bit, at how out of it her parents seemed to be and how not understanding of my diet they were. I even had a ten-minute conversation with her mom on the porch one morning about what I could and couldn’t eat and why.
THERAPIST: She didn’t—
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Her mom didn’t—
CLIENT: Exactly. No, I know, I was really—I was aggravated. Amelia was aggravated, as well.
THERAPIST: Is red meat supposed to exacerbate an ulcer?
CLIENT: Yeah. I’m not supposed to have red meat. If I could have red meat, it would not—I couldn’t get it from a fast food restaurant with all the sauces and stuff on it. According to my nutritionist, no red meat.
THERAPIST: Is the idea that you continue on this strict diet?
CLIENT: No. I have an appointment in two weeks, now. The idea is that – hopefully – in two weeks, when I go in, because I haven’t really had symptoms for a while, that they’ll tell me I can start going off the medicine. You can’t just go off it, I have to taper it.
THERAPIST: It seems so particular—you can eat ham, but not the skin of the ham.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know.
THERAPIST: You’re not going to eat the entire skin of an entire ham.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: That little piece of skin seems—
CLIENT: Who knows? I’m sure I ate a little bit of skin while I was eating. In that regard, eating things has been going kind of well for me, lately. I’ve been adding some things and eating more things that I definitely wouldn’t have even touched.
THERAPIST: That’s great.
CLIENT: Yeah. Now I feel like I’m finally in—I’ve been weighing myself at the gym, I’m in this range, give or take five pounds. I feel like it’s stable. I’m exercising and feeling good about it. I feel like I’m eating well.
THERAPIST: This ulcer exacerbated your preoccupation with food.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Which I don’t think was good for you, in the end.
CLIENT: No. No, I mean, it’s like—
THERAPIST: A phobic response, almost.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Well, the same thing happened to me when I was younger. Whatever I was having, it was different than this. Maybe it was gastritis, I don’t know if it was pre-ulcer or ulcerous or something, but I was vomiting every morning. [00:18:00]
THERAPIST: It’s a fine line, because it’s good to follow a doctor’s orders, but it can become obsessive.
CLIENT: Oh, I totally became—and that’s exactly what happened.
THERAPIST: It reminds me of when you were losing weight and people were saying, “Oh, you look great,” it’s sort of like the nutritionist saying, “Oh, you’re doing grand, you’re following it to the T.” That’s actually not always that good.
CLIENT: Yeah. I chatted with her a little bit, as well, before we went on vacation, because I was, at that point—because I think it was easy for me to be, “I’m going to do this even more than they’re saying I’m going to do this, because then I’m going to heal faster.” ","P1-N400C71":"[00:21:07] When that didn’t happen, I kind of was like, “I can’t. This is not sustainable. I can’t only eat these five things.”
CLIENT: It fuels my phobia about taking medicine, also, because now I really can’t take a lot of medicine because of my stomach. I was having sinus headaches over the weekend. We had to do 45 minutes of research to find a Sudafed that had acetaminophen in it instead of ibuprofen or instead of ","P1-N400D31":"naproxen. By that point, I don’t want to take anything, because who knows what’s in it? I didn’t take anything. [00:24:00] I took a nap and I felt better. I don’t know.
THERAPIST: You don’t actually know that.
CLIENT: Well, no, Sudafed I can take. That’s apparently what I can take, because it’s acetaminophen.
THERAPIST: Right, but you could take something else with ibuprofen and take one dosage and you could be just fine.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know, they told me not to take anything with ibuprofen.
THERAPIST: After certain procedures, they tell you not to take – is it Tylenol that thins your blood? It’s something that thins your blood – for I don’t know how long.
CLIENT: Ibuprofen. [00:25:00]
THERAPIST: That’s crazy. If you speak to other doctors, they say it’s absolutely crazy. These things are not going to kill you. One dose of things is not going to kill you.
CLIENT: Yeah. I’m convinced it will. [laughs]
THERAPIST: I know you are. (crosstalk at 00:25:20)
CLIENT: It’s like, what’s worse: the panic attack of taking the pill or just taking a nap for a couple hours while I wait for the headache to go away?
THERAPIST: Right, but the panic attack is not necessarily inevitable. I know it feels inevitable, but it’s inevitable because it’s triggered by a series of thoughts.
CLIENT: Yeah.
CLIENT: Where my anxiety kind of fluctuates between Amelia’s safety, my safety, my health, that’s kind of—I share the love with all sorts of things in my life. [00:26:09] My brother’s is just focused on health things. You think I’m bad? He doesn’t have the same issue with mediation—
THERAPIST: Did I say you were bad (inaudible at 00:26:18)?
CLIENT: Not bad, but I’m like, “I won’t take Tylenol,” or, “I won’t take one Advil because my stomach will bleed out.”
THERAPIST: There’s a certain feeling un-safety (ph) in your body.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Seems very unsettling.
CLIENT: Yeah. It makes me really frustrated, because I didn’t—I wasn’t always like this. [00:28:00]
THERAPIST: It’s not “The Atlantic Monthly,” it’s a separate—?
CLIENT: I’m not sure. I don’t read it.
THERAPIST: “The Atlantic Monthly” is more of a literary magazine.
CLIENT: Ah, yeah. I don’t think it’s literary—I don’t think, anyway. I’m not sure, because I just stumbled—I stumbled upon random articles from them through other people, most of the time. I have never actually looked through their website too much.
THERAPIST: You’re feeling something was lost in that?
CLIENT: I don’t know that something in our relationship is lost, necessarily. That just reminded me of the fact that this is a big issue that I need to deal with. That she can’t even remember what I was like before, knowing about all my anxiety.
THERAPIST: I do think medicine would help you.
CLIENT: I don’t know.
CLIENT: I just feel like that can’t be the only option. There has to be something I can do to control it myself.
THERAPIST: Medicine isn’t the only thing, but it’s certainly something that would help a lot. One can’t control anxiety. That doesn’t happen. That doesn’t work that way. People can develop techniques to calm themselves down in the moment, but the ongoing, underlying anxiety, ","P1-N4012D1":"it’s such a sort of wired state. You can’t really control that. It’s like trying to control your mind. That doesn’t happen.
CLIENT: I’m just worried about the side effects. I don’t want it—I hear all these stories that people who go on this medication and it changes their personality a little bit. No?
THERAPIST: No. Not really. Not in my experience. I work with a lot of people who go on medication. I’m not a pill pusher. I don’t even prescribe.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: It’s not something that I—
CLIENT: Right, yeah, no, I know.
THERAPIST: I do think—
CLIENT: It’s just making my stomach turn thinking about it.
THERAPIST: On a practical level, taking medication is never as big a deal as it might feel. First of all, because if it doesn’t help you—if it works, great. [00:34:01] If it doesn’t work, you just stop taking it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Your losses, in a very practical sense, are nil.
CLIENT: How soon do you know whether it’s working or not?
THERAPIST: Depends on what you’re prescribed. There are certain medications that help alleviate anxiety in the moment, those are pretty obvious pretty quick. There are the medications that take a couple weeks to build up into your bloodstream.
CLIENT: What do you mean?
THERAPIST: When I think about—one aspect of anxiety is just sort of an ongoing experience, and also how your mind works. Have you ever said, “Stop obsessing and don’t think about food anymore”? [00:35:00] How does that work? It’s the way your mind is processing—
CLIENT: I feel like when I’m doing well, I can channel it. Do you know what I mean? In a healthy way.
THERAPIST: Maybe, but you’re not always going to do well. Not everybody always does well.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:35:13) stressed you out. Not because of who you are, just because of life.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I brought it up because I think, at the very least, it’s important to sort of think about.
CLIENT: Yeah. I’ve never even given it thought. I feel like I channel my mother. When I was younger – I think it was in high school, maybe middle school – and they took me to—I don’t know if she was a psychiatrist. I think she might have been a psychiatrist, child psychiatrist ","P1-N4015D1":"or something, because I wasn’t doing well in school – as well as my mother thought that I could do. [00:36:04] Which I later proved her right, when I had suddenly started making the dean’s list in college, it was like, “I told you so.”
THERAPIST: Well, it’s interesting. The story that you told, your mom didn’t really want to consult with a professional. She wanted the professional to fulfill her idea of what was wrong. She wanted to stay in control. She wasn’t actually looking for expert advice.
CLIENT: Yeah.
CLIENT: I guess, in a way, that’s like—with my other therapist [I saw in Chicago] (ph), it’s like I come in the first day and I’m like, “Listen, I’m here because I want to deal with this issue, but I’m not taking medication.” I don’t know if it’s—if ","P1-N4016F1":"I should relinquish—I don’t know. I want to be able to hold onto that and figure out how to make my situation work without going there, but I don’t know.
THERAPIST: Jehovah’s Witnesses don’t take medication because it’s a religious principle.
CLIENT: I’m afraid of what it’ll do to me, aside from potentially make me feel better.
THERAPIST: It’s more a, in a sense, practical. It’s not like a moral issue, per se.
CLIENT: No, it’s not a moral issue for me at all. [00:39:01] I’ve done drugs and I drink. I’m not opposed to—I have this issue with putting things in my body that would alter my state of mind, at this point.
THERAPIST: It’s interesting, because, in a sense, that that’s what the medication would help with. It has (crosstalk at 00:39:20).
CLIENT: My old therapist laughed, because she made the suggestion when I came back from Red Cross. I went to see her before moving up here and process—well, because I was starting to have these anxiety issues, suddenly. When I got back from Egypt was when it really started.
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like part of it is feeling like you’ll lose control, like your personality will be altered, there’ll (ph) be that lack of control that makes you very anxious.
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: Which is a fear that really has no practical consequence, because if that actually happened – which it probably wouldn’t – you just stop taking it. [00:41:07] There’s nothing to be lost, in that sense, but that’s not the point.
CLIENT: Do you think I’m just doomed if I don’t try it?
THERAPIST: I don’t even know where to start with that! [laughs]
CLIENT: Not “doomed,” but is that—I just always wanted to think of my anxiety as something I deal with but something that I…I don’t know. [00:42:01] I also feel like—on the one hand, yeah, I’m just terrified of taking medication, terrified. I feel like I want ","P1-N4018F1":"to cry. On the other hand, I also don’t want to—I feel like that’s like admitting that my anxiety has complete control over me. I feel like there is a social stigma to it, as well.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Which is not—you know—
THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:42:24)
CLIENT: It’s not—now I might just be making up excuses. It’s mostly the fear of actually taking medication.
THERAPIST: Again, the issue of—the anxiety of relinquishing control is part of the problem.
CLIENT: Right. I know. It’s been (crosstalk at 00:42:39).
THERAPIST: It’s definitely a catch-22.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: We don’t have control over our affective states. We can think about them and there are things that we can do that can help them, but you can’t will away anxiety. I certainly don’t think you’re doomed. I think it will help. You certainly have a wiring for it. [00:43:01] ","P1-N401A11":"It’s in your family. That doesn’t mean you’re doomed and it doesn’t mean other things won’t help. From my perspective, I’m a pragmatist at heart. Why not do everything you can to make it better?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Or at least try.
CLIENT: Yeah. It’s a conversation that I’m willing to have, but I can’t assure you that I’m not just saying that to make you happy right now. [laughs] I’ll talk about it, but I’m pretty stubborn. I don’t know that I’ll be convinced, ever. I think I should ","P1-N401A71":"talk to my brother, because I think that he’s on medication. I know he’s on medication, I’m pretty sure it’s for anxiety. I think I should talk to him.
THERAPIST: Well, far be it for me to take your anxiety to take your anxiety away from you. I don’t want to…
CLIENT: [laughs] How dare you? [laughs]
THERAPIST: I don’t want to break up…
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: …the attachment. [00:44:02]
CLIENT: I guess I just don’t know anyone that’s like, “Oh, I’ve had such a great time with my anti-anxiety pills.” Maybe Jaime will tell me, like, “Yeah, Kelsey. They help a lot. You need to see a psychiatrist.”
THERAPIST: For some people, they really do. I’ve seen really a very—I don’t think they’re like the cure-all for some people, they just don’t feel like they do much. Certain anxiety medication, the biggest complaint I’ve heard is that it’s – and this is ","P1-N401B51":"not all anxiety medication – but kind of flattens you a bit, and people don’t like that and they’ll go off because of that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That’s not everybody’s experience. That’s only one kind of medication. To me, that’s the biggest complaint I’ve heard. Not anything else – no one complains, “God, my personality is completely transformed. I don’t even recognize myself anymore.” ","P1-N401B91":"I don’t hear that very much.
CLIENT: I guess what I mean, “My personality would change,” that flat feeling, that’s what I’ve heard.
THERAPIST: That’s not really personality. [00:45:00]
CLIENT: I feel like it’s dulled (ph). Because I [am that] (ph), I think that my anxiety contributes to my high-energy personality, which I like about myself.
THERAPIST: Again, that’s only one type of medication, one classification.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: It’s certainly not the only option.
CLIENT: I will talk to my brother…
THERAPIST: Good (ph).
CLIENT: …and to Amelia.
THERAPIST: I think, practically, that’s good. Also, just the meaning of it and this issue around control and how your anxiety—your wish to control your anxiety feeds your anxiety. That’s sort of the catch-22. I think that’s an important piece.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay, so I will see you next week!
CLIENT: Yeah. I start classes on Monday, so my schedule changes a little bit. I get out of class at 1:00 on Thursdays…
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: …so let’s try it next week, and then if it seems like it’s going to be too—I don’t know of anything else about my academic schedule [without looking at it] (ph)…
THERAPIST: Okay. [00:46:01]
CLIENT: …so I don’t know what else I would necessarily have going on. Next week should be fine…
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: …but we might need to have a conversation next week about (inaudible at 00:46:08).
THERAPIST: Okay. The very first week of February, I’m away the week.
CLIENT: Okay, no problem.
THERAPIST: Okay? Okay.
CLIENT: All right.
THERAPIST: See you next week, take care.
CLIENT: Thanks so much.
THERAPIST: Okay, bye-bye.
