TITLE: Client "J", Session April 16, 2014: Client discusses ongoing divorce, and progress with clients at work.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses ongoing divorce, and progress with clients at work.
CLIENT: The order doesn’t enter for 30 days and I don’t know the date for the absolute judgment. Just been going nonstop. I was nauseous for three days straight. Did nothing. I was just dead over the weekend. Friday – Saturday I was able to do work. I was literally in bed all day Sunday. ","P1-N4000B1":"I was behind to begin with and, you know, I didn’t have the kids all weekend. I canceled Passover with Tracy. And to tell you the truth, I kind of needed a break. So I mean granted, I felt like crap, but, you know. And then I had to work like nuts on Monday, and so cancelled the kids. And I don’t ","P1-N4000B2":"know whether it’s physical exhaustion or I’m getting mental exhaustion. But I’m just trying to do so many things and going so fast. I wanted to, after here, go and make some copies at FedEx Kinkos. [1:07] The reality is that I don’t have time. Got a meeting at the farm at 5:00 ","P1-N4000B3":"which I found out about this morning, ‘cause God forbid, they tell me.
THERAPIST: The landlord kind of stuff.
CLIENT: Yeah. Demand letters. There’s responding to demand letters. I’ve got this motion. Plus, all the other crap. Who knows? And I’ve got phone calls coming in every day. It’s almost to the point that I’m putting new client meetings ahead of getting work done. [3:03] ","P1-N400111":"And today’s a good day. I got that thing at the farm, but I was supposed to move the client. Moved that. I’m going to go down to Marcia’s at – I don’t know why but when I’m down there and she’s not there, I’m very productive. I think that maybe I don’t ","P1-N400112":"have a comfortable workspace in my apartment. I’ve got a very small desk.
THERAPIST: Maybe it’s nice to be in her space. And easier to be productive when she’s not in it, too.
CLIENT: Yeah. But I’ve worked when she’s been there. It’s just the type of work. And that’s the thing is like, these letters and motions are – and that’s what’s going on is, I’m mentally exhausted. That’s the only way I can describe it. Just forgetting ","P1-N400151":"which way I’m going, what’s up, what’s down. [4:02] But I’m doing okay with it. Like, being late here. I was like, fuck it, I’m stopping and getting a coffee. I found out where all the parking spots are this time of day. I went over back towards the street. I’m always ","P1-N400152":"looking over here. You know, it’s like, if I don’t have these packages ready to go out, and bah, wah, wah. You know, it’s like, I think I have time to do everything, but I don’t have time to do anything. And normally, this stuff would freak me out. You know, maybe it’s ","P1-N400153":"‘cause I know, well, if I piss off this client, se la vie. They’re just another client. I don’t want to say my service is suffering, but I’m becoming better at organizing. Like, I had to be someplace at 6:30. You know, to me that was a pain in the ass to reschedule that. 5:04] ","P1-N400154":"Now, it’s like, boom. Hey, can we do next Wednesday. I’m constantly juggling – screwing things up, because I don’t put it in my phone right. People showing up and, you know. But I don’t know. But, I’m glad the divorce thing’s fucking done. She’s just a ","P1-N400155":"pain in the ass.
THERAPIST: Are you on same rates you’ve been? Like, the same dosage and stuff?
CLIENT: Why, ‘cause I’m talking fast?
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: We changed it around a couple times.
THERAPIST: Here’s why I’m asking, is because I mean, you sound pretty harried, although I also get that you’re doing pretty well with it. It’s just a lot of stuff. And I’m wondering, you know, if being anxious is contributing or if maybe just kind of keeping organized, ","P1-N4001F1":"part with your stuff and part in your head, has been more of a thing than we made it out to be. It’s just been we probably missed it is you haven’t been as busy for a while. And so I mean, the (inaudible at 6:30) helped mostly with things like focus. Then it should help I think, a little ","P1-N4001F2":"bit with organization, so that’s why I asked.
CLIENT: You know, and that’s the thing that, you know. It’s not unlike – it’s not just going to be a switch. I’ve got to learn procedures that I didn’t have to deal with before. You know, to send a wire. I’m giving myself ten, fifteen minutes. It took the guy ","P1-N400211":"that much time to get up from his chair. So it’s that kind of thing where that had always kind of been there in the past, where I had my day schedule and it blew up. [7:11] And I think I’m managing it pretty well. I could be managing it better.
THERAPIST: Well, I’m glad you’re managing it and it’s not really overwhelming you.
CLIENT: I have rough moments, you know, but I’m getting upset. But I think on a whole – like Monday, I recognized what was going on. I shut the computer down, ‘cause I was sick and still was kind of sick. I hadn’t seen Marcia. And then, last night was the divorce, and she’s ","P1-N400251":"like, oh, are you sure you want to come down and do some work? I just said, fuck it. I sent what I had to the client, and I said, fuck it. You know, and I went down there. [8:05] You know, I can’t work constant. And that’s the thing.
THERAPIST: Right. Certain stuff is staring to make it through the pipeline.
CLIENT: And talking to people, you know, and then okay, I’ll do a demand letter. You know, I’m charging just an hour, you know. Whatever. Got more title exams coming in. The guy that Phil rents space from. You know, they would use me as a backup. Well, their guy’s getting old and doesn’t ","P1-N4002D1":"want to do southern Massachusetts and doesn’t want to do Huntington. And they used to use for like, Barnstable and when this guy went on vacation. [11:22] And they’re sending me a fucking Massachusetts title, every other day now. I’m like, just – But I’ve got to use a night ","P1-N4002D2":"like tonight and fucking crank some fucking work out. And I’ve got to get caught up. I lost this weekend. You know, I mean, I had stuff planned, but still in there was – And I even worked on Saturday, but I wasn’t feeling well, so I couldn’t work on the motion which is what I ","P1-N4002D3":"should have been working on.
THERAPIST: You mean, that your calls go through your Gmail as well.
CLIENT: Everything goes through Gmail. So, Gmail is my voice-mail. Everything forwards to my cell phone, and then Gmail is my voice-mail. I haven’t integrated the phone to Gmail, because I don’t need that. But I have two numbers on the Internet. [16:26] I’ve got a Plymouth number that’s ","P1-N400371":"a Gmail number. The number in Pembroke. The fax number in Pembroke which I’m questioning whether I need those two. ‘Cause I think you can port numbers to Google Voice. And if I can port my fax line to the fax like eFax or whatever, I’ll do it, ‘cause I’m paying 60 bucks ","P1-N400372":"for a fax line.
THERAPIST: Yeah? That’s good.
CLIENT: Hands down.
THERAPIST: That’s great. [21:26]
CLIENT: I have started two closings – three closings. One’s a seller. And I’ve got another closing on the 25th. I’ve got a seller rep that’s actually being pushed back to May now, but the buyer wants me to do the title insurance, and it’s like a $400,000 deal. So ","P1-N400451":"it’s like, just gravy, you know. Triples what I’m going to make on it. That actually just got pushed back into May. But money’s coming in now from, you know, like that case I did with Feld. you know. They’re sending the money I think Friday. ‘Cause I was like, hey. I’m ","P1-N400452":"learning to send statements and bill people and keep on top of that stuff. [22:17] It’s a lot to handle.
THERAPIST: Sounds like I must have been very informative.
CLIENT: Informative?
THERAPIST: I’m sort of teasing you. You know, I’ve learned how to bill people. And then I thought well, it’s funny. I just sent you a bill for the first time in a long time.
CLIENT: Well, I was like, the same way. (pause) I’ve got to start digging out of the hole and get out of the mess. I didn’t even think. I’m like, eh, you know, health insurance is not a debt. If I’m waiting to pay. I mean, if they’re sending me cancellation notices, you ","P1-N4004D1":"know, it’s crossing with my check in the mail. Maybe I should be – that’s a debt. Maybe I shouldn’t be putting myself in that position. [23:40] I don’t know. (pause) I don’t know what else is going on. My mind doesn’t want to function. It’s like, right ","P1-N4004D2":"now, I don’t even know if I’m going into court tomorrow morning. Well, I know I am – well, most likely am.
THERAPIST: I think historically, responsibility has tended to stress you out. And it seems like in a lot of ways you’re getting more of it, but are handling it better than you have. [25:06]
CLIENT: Well, I don’t have to (inaudible at 25:11) I just don’t want to have to do shit. This call. This call. 542… I got 32 notifications on Facebook, and I haven’t even checked them. I don’t see a message. But I got to contact a client for tomorrow and see if they want ","P1-N400511":"me to come in and e-mail another guy, and say sorry, I can’t go in – or I can’t meet with you. (pause) There’s this one client, you know, my life insurance guy referred to me like, two weeks ago and I still – First, he was going to wait for the client to call me. And then ","P1-N400512":"just, right now, it’s like, I’m thinking about it, but I’ll forget about it. You know, those little microcassettes. Siri’s not built for quick – I can’t do Siri with (inaudible at 27:46)
CLIENT: I’ve got to remember to look at my notes. I try to do that sometimes, you know, play out all the things I need to do, especially when I’ve got an hour, I’m going to be on the computer for an hour. [28:24] I get so distracted so easily.
THERAPIST: Maybe you could just add to that list add how long it’s going to take and by when it needs to be done?
CLIENT: I’ve got to get this spreadsheet going and really just start tracking everything. A guy was a moron and an asshole, but an old boss gave some good advice, that you really should touch every file every day. And that spreadsheet would allow me to do that. I think I just farted, sorry. [29:22] ","P1-N400591":"I like the song, but I don’t want to answer the phone. (pause) See on the farm, I feel like I’m used in a decent capacity for my legal. And I donate money and I find money. But they keep putting me on these fucking committees and nothing gets done.
THERAPIST: Why don’t we stop for now?
CLIENT: ‘Cause I don’t want to stop.
THERAPIST: Let’s stop.
CLIENT: We’re stopping for now. So I won’t see you next week, ‘cause you’ve got some secret something going on.
THERAPIST: Right. I’ll see you a week from Tuesday?
CLIENT: If I’m still around, yeah.
