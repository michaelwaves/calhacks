TITLE: Client "Ju", Session March 25, 2014: Client talks about work situations and professionalism.
DESCRIPTION: Client talks about work situations and professionalism.
CLIENT: I�m really tired. So this last week or two I�ve yet again been feeling like � so there was an e-mail sent out by the Heroes program where you could nominate someone to get a little prize from Heroes. And for whatever reason, we�ve been sent that reminder � ","P1-N4000B1":"the library�s been sent that reminder two or three times. Like, a lot. And one of the things you could nominate someone for was for increasing diversity in their area or helping out with diversity in their area. [1:16] And so every time the library forwards that I just sort of look at it and ","P1-N4000B2":"I�m just like, I really hate all of you. And then these sort of � I don�t know. There are a few other things. Like, there�s a � doing job talks for the head of home library and a bunch of other. They�re doing a bunch of hiring. And all the final candidates are ","P1-N4000B3":"white as, you know, they do. And I don�t know. I just really very intensely wanted to e-mail. Because the head of the huge Cambridge Library concept was saying how she was going away and that someone named Susan Post (ph) was going to be in charge of the hiring stuff until she got back. [2:22]
THERAPIST: Sorry, you�re no longer what?
CLIENT: Angry when I look at his desk. But he�s coming back on Monday, so I�m not getting anywhere. [5:22] I was just thinking about how unimportant he is to my daily life for anything to really � His absence is only meaningful in terms of time reporting. Because normally he approves ","P1-N400131":"my time and now he�s not. And also, there�s no one to back me up on multimedia stuff. There�s not many people. So it�s just like, you�re � I�ve certainly be discussing how useless he is for quite a while. But I don�t know, there�s something ","P1-N400132":"about him having been gone for such a big stretch of time. And I�m like wow, you really are just so irrelevant to what I � Not irrelevant. It�s like it�s more kind of like it�s kind of irrelevant. So you have abandoned me as an employee. You�re not involved ","P1-N400133":"with anything I do or ask about it or give me help when I ask for it. [6:45] And since he�s my manager kind of by accident\/default and in the department I am in, because the new department is a catch-all of, I don�t know, lots of one or two person groups. They just kind of pushed them ","P1-N400134":"into one department. So there�s not a lot of real cohesion. And I feel like no � I don�t know, I don�t feel I�m part of the department, really. So there�s that. And Karl (sp) big idea for right now is we have to rename our department, because that will be really ","P1-N400135":"important. The last couple of staff meetings he�s been talking about that. Great. It�s not relevant. [8:10] And so part of � the other part of why I�ve been feeling like Chet sort of abandoned me as an employee is So at one point we had � it was a fight.
THERAPIST: You and Chet.
CLIENT: Yeah. It was a more of I guess, an intense professional disagreement, because no one was yelling. But he what it came down to was that his stance was like, I�m not happy unless when I give someone advice on technology they do what I say.
THERAPIST: All right. His stance was when you say, I am not happy meaning Karen?
CLIENT: He�s like, Karen, you ae only � you just want everyone to do whatever you think is the way to do it. Because I was expressing frustration about people just buying lumps of technology that don�t work and I could have told them that it don�t work or did tell them it ","P1-N4001B1":"wouldn�t work. [9:29]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 9:33)
CLIENT: Yeah. And that�s the other thing. And, I mean part of what I felt � do feel is like, if someone says, we are making a political decision for whatever reason, this is just happening, it�s not � I can be like, okay, I guess it�s just happening. But with all of ","P1-N4001F1":"these technology lumps, it was very intense. Like, no, this is not a weird decision from on high. This is like � I guess it�s not that exactly. I guess sort of no one at a higher level is willing to say or able to say you bought this as window dressing. Or, it�s important that we ","P1-N4001F2":"had some shiny technology. Or just, you know. Something. Because that would make me � It would be less frustrating sort of, if I thought that Karl understood why these things aren�t working, but I don�t think he does. [11:11] And he seems to think they�re amazing.
THERAPIST: I think you mentioned something that you gave one of them that they really liked.
CLIENT: Yeah. I gave them some more stuff. But yesterday there was this like, all library � And I�ll e-mail them something and like, it�s so amazing. This is a library run Tumblr blog. Isn�t that �?
THERAPIST: Awesome.
CLIENT: Yes. And innovative. And I was so frustrated. It makes me so � What I feel is like � It feels like my whatever � Like, if I say something, no one can hear it. [14:48] And I also feel like part of that is I am not a librarian. And I guess more to the point, most people don�t ","P1-N400291":"think of me as becoming a librarian even though I talk about library school a lot. So there is the blog that happened. Another librarian came to me to ask about Internet security, because she was being invited to prepare a talk. And I was like yeah, that�s something that I want to do and you�re ","P1-N400292":"doing and you�re not qualified to do this. But okay, sure. [15:38] There�s one other thing that I can�t remember right now. And so it feels like � It feels like I raised my hand at a meeting and said something and got shot down. And then, a guy raises his hand, it�s ","P1-N400293":"like oh, did you think of this? Everyone�s like, that�s amazing, sort of. But I know that�s not actually what happened. I don�t think anyone was told to get videos. It�s just that when they came up with them �
THERAPIST: They talked to people that were perceptive, unlike Chet.
CLIENT: Yes. Oh, the other thing is that one of the things that�s repeated a lot is like, well, you know, this is a librarian run talk or this is a librarian run blog, which is frustrating. Like, it feels like not having the degree, the MLS is like, useless. Like, I don�t exist until I ","P1-N4002D1":"have that. Even though one of the librarians that they hired, she doesn�t have an MLS, she has a Ph.D. It�s considered equivalent. I think it�s weird, but okay. [17:19] Yeah, like that has nothing to do with anything.
THERAPIST: Yeah. That would mean that I know more about libraries than you.
CLIENT: �Cause, you know, you�ve got a Ph.D. You�ve got all the smarts. All that researching. Really, the idea is actually half well, you spent a lot of time in the library to get your Ph.D. and half like, Ph.Ds. are fancy.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: I know. I�m like, all right, I guess. It just never �
THERAPIST: By the sounds of it, it�s ludicrous, though.
CLIENT: What?
THERAPIST: By the sounds of it, it�s ludicrous.
CLIENT: Yeah. Just like, it doesn�t make any sense. Like, you can get a Ph.D. in library science.
THERAPIST: Yeah. That would be different.
CLIENT: This is just like, oh, you have an English Ph.D. which doesn�t make me feel like, your Ph.D. I don�t think makes you more qualified than my bachelors.
THERAPIST: That�s what I�m saying, yeah.
CLIENT: And also, I went to school. I got a bachelors. Come on.
THERAPIST: And you�re like two credits shy, a class shy or something in getting your library degree? I�m pretty sure you�ve worked in the library for a while.
CLIENT: Over six years, which is kind of terrifying. But I feel like I can�t really � It�s super frustrating and it�s something that I�m trying really hard to kind of, I guess talk to co-workers or talk to my like, library mentor person about. [19:32] �Cause ","P1-N400491":"like, my co-workers I can understand feel kind of awkward, because � Like the new librarians are kind of like, eh, sorry. Because part of my complaint is that � not with the person we hired, but � My library mentor basically is friendly and of the belief that if you just, you know, ","P1-N400492":"send your message up the hierarchical chain then, of course, it will be responded to in an intelligent manner. [20:16] I don�t know if it�s something that I can convince her of otherwise, and I�m not like, whatever (inaudible 20:32) In addition to it being frustrating, it also makes ","P1-N400493":"me feel like very both isolated and also on the outside looking in.
THERAPIST: So her point was kind of like, you know, don�t be really gossipy and complaining about stuff, you know, if you aren�t happy with the way things are done, you know, don�t put it on the patrons or in a way like, customers, and also take it up with the development people, ","P1-N400511":"not just sort of in a gossipy way that spreads it around or something. Except that the actual upshot of that is some (inaudible at 28:15) for sort of power or transparency that are actually very problematic. [28:23]
CLIENT: I wasn�t getting at that, but yes. I couldn�t get � but yeah, like, I don�t know.
THERAPIST: It means that the I suppose a real problem for the people in the groups that have less power maybe?
CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like the �
THERAPIST: Because if the people in the group somehow don�t want to hear about it, they don�t know where to go?
CLIENT: Yeah. Like, I feel like this upholds the status quo and upholds structural and institutional, oppressive policies or thoughts. And it also makes � I mean, I also feel like it�s silencing dissent which � there�s something at the edge of it where I�m like, yeah, ","P1-N4005B1":"you shouldn�t be the angry person yelling at this guy all the time.
THERAPIST: Or, like, going and complaining to everyone else around that you don�t like some policy within your group, but not bring it up within your group.
CLIENT: But also how you do you convey disagreement. And also, if you or someone who�s like, okay, I am agreeing with this policy in public and someone comes to you and says, I don�t know about that policy, are you supposed to just say well, you know, it�s like, you�re in ","P1-N4005F1":"public so you can�t disagree. [30:24] And that is I don�t know. I mean, one of the things I�ve been sort of I guess feeling kind of strongly is, as I�m finishing this MLS and have been spending more time working in the library, I feel like the division of professional (inaudible ","P1-N4005F2":"at 31:10) employee is � and I don�t like it for like, hierarchical reasons, but I also feel like it�s bad for the library. It�s bad for the institution. [31:30] Because you�re not willing to accept or are interested in information from people who are I guess on the ","P1-N4005F3":"ground doing things. And it also reinforces that there is the librarians who know the answer and have the final answer and are competent, knowledgeable, professional people and then, there�s everyone else.
THERAPIST: Is that what she�s actually saying?
CLIENT: No. I don�t think so. I think � so there�s this part of it that � She definitely is saying, don�t be gossipy, don�t dump it on patrons who can�t say anything. But she never � she doesn�t really explain what she means by public and ","P1-N400651":"private. Like, it is unclear to me if she considers talking to me something in public that she can�t disagree with is private, librarians only and is public everyone else. [34:55] So I kind of want to ask her about it and I kind of don�t. Flailing on it. But I guess she leaves a lot in ","P1-N400652":"sort of � we all know that it�s kind of like this background well, of course, everyone knows what is meant. What I mean by public and private. And of course, we all know that this is a really important organizational philosophy that we all know about. And I�m just kind of well � ","P1-N400653":"A big part of me was well, what if we don�t all know that. And also, even if you think we all know it, we may not all be thinking the same thing. [35:51] And I get that it�s not a (inaudible 36:04] It�s not a life-changing whatever. I guess the other part of the frustration is I�m ","P1-N400654":"not sure if I asked her directly if she would answer � if she would answer obviously.
THERAPIST: If she would answer?
CLIENT: If I � I don�t know. If I asked like, so are you saying � what are you saying by public and private. You know, do you not disagree outside of your reference staff meeting. [36:51] I don�t know that � I don�t know if I can trust her answer, because I ","P1-N400691":"mean, because if I am part of the public you�re not supposed to be disagreeing with, then she would say so. So I�m just sort of like, eh?
THERAPIST: It sounds like the way it strikes you is similar to the things you were (inaudible at 37:30 as though you have no voice. And at times because it doesn�t matter. It is actually kind of in print and enshrined in the professional journal thing. So you get to talk to talk in these places ","P1-N4006B1":"and you don�t get to talk in those places is probably what people would say. I mean, it seems like it sort of officializes.
CLIENT: It also feels very � It feels to me kind of out of date. [38:19] I guess in a way when I asked my dad for job advice sometimes and the answers he gives me, I feel they�re kind of out of date. I�m just, uh, I understand that when you were working, you progressed up the corporate ","P1-N4006D1":"ladder and you stayed with the company for 20 years or whatever, 30 years. But people don�t do that a lot. And, you know, loyalty to the company only goes so far. And also, your secretary is allowed to talk now, or to say no, I�m not going to do your Christmas cards or whatever. [39:16]
THERAPIST: Well, and out of touch-ness.
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it�s like, do you � Cambridge is way crazier of a hierarchy than a lot of places, especially libraries. [41:06] Yeah. I guess part of it is like, yeah, the sense of � There�s a sense of professionalism which is about the importance of not talking to ","P1-N400731":"people if that makes sense. Which I don�t agree with. The other thing it makes me think of is � So Ashby�s hiring for a job in her workplace. She just fired someone. And someone applied who is not competent enough for the job. But this person who�s � she�s like ","P1-N400732":"in her 50s, early 60s. It�s pretty clear that her feeling is that well, I have the most seniority, so you should give me this job. And Ashby told her, yes, but you�re not good at these things. You wrote an incoherent cover letter that made no sense. The thing that you�re supervising ","P1-N400733":"is something that you were the worst at doing last year. [42:14] Etcetera, etcetera. And her response basically seemed to be, but did I mention that I have more seniority than you do. And that�s what it feels like. Seniority is � or not even seniority really. Just kind of like the status ","P1-N400734":"quo must be maintained at all costs.
THERAPIST: Creepy.
CLIENT: It makes me feel very � I don�t want to say paranoid. But I�m just, you know, are people � are you silently judging me for complaining about something?
THERAPIST: Instead of saying 1985, I thought you were going to say 1984.
CLIENT: Actually, I started to say 1984, but then I was like, I don�t mean that, 1984,
CLIENT: It�s not like that, but there is that. I kind of feel, are we being � are you closely monitoring whether or not � whatever. [43:40] Yeah. I was thinking another thing is that, depending on how she means public and private, it�s sort of say, that like everyone outside ","P1-N4007F1":"of the group,, whatever the private group is, can�t be trusted to act appropriately. So if you were too transparent and gave them too much information, they would, I don�t know, riot in the streets or something. Which again, is very weird. [44:32]
THERAPIST: Is there a bibliography? Are these just like, an essay with her thoughts?
CLIENT: Yes. It�s an essay with her personal thoughts.
THERAPIST: I mean, nothing about organizational structure or core communication of organization?
CLIENT: No management theories. The title of the column is hilariously, not dead yet. The librarian who writes it is an older librarian. And she used to write a lot about �
THERAPIST: Oh, it�s a column?
CLIENT: Yeah. It�s a column. She started out reviewing databases that were on CDs and things like that. Not dead. Not forcibly retired.
THERAPIST: Why don�t we stop for now?
CLIENT: Okay.
