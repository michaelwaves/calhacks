TITLE: Client "SM", Session May 31, 2013: Client discusses the importance of taking stock of one's own life.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the importance of taking stock of one's own life.
CLIENT: (joined in progress) (inaudible).
THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: He was (inaudible).
THERAPIST: Yeah, there are a lot of move outs.
CLIENT: So here is...
THERAPIST: Okay, thank you. (pause) All right!
CLIENT: So... (pause) What I’m about to say, I always feel like, “Oh God! Your job, to listen to this!” (laughs) You just listen to people complain!
THERAPIST: Really? [00:58:00]
CLIENT: Anyway...
THERAPIST: Huh!
CLIENT: I don’t know! I just, you know... I don’t know. Sometimes you just sort of take stock and like, I don’t know. When I’m taking a class, it’s like I really focus on that, and I’m able to somehow block out other stuff, perhaps? And now, it’s like... God! ","P1-N4001F1":"I don’t know; it’s... I don’t know, mid-life crisis, which I don’t know that, quite what that is. I don’t really, I resist the term, but just I look and think... I know there are very different meanings of it, but, it’s like 44, no job, no kids, not married, broke... [00:01:40]
THERAPIST: Yeah, what are you thinking?
CLIENT: I don’t know. Like, I don’t know. It’s just, it’s like, like right now, I’m not feeling... I’m not really feeling, but I’m just sort of aware, then I’m by myself, I’m like... God! [00:02:39]
THERAPIST: What do you get hit with, yeah?
CLIENT: Well, it’s like, you know, I’m home and... I don’t know. Like, I’m in this house and, you know, like what’s been going on recently? You know, it’s spackling, it’s sanding, yesterday priming and... You know like... but you’re sort of like, sometimes ","P1-N400291":"I’m hit with like just, sort of the... (inaudible) nature of things. I’m thinking, I’m looking at all this wallpaper that she put up, right? And then, now she died in the house. And I’m thinking, “Well, is this where I’m going to die? And I, you know, somebody else ","P1-N400292":"is going to come along and paint over what I’ve painted.” I mean, that’s really it, you know? So you’re just sort of painting and you’re taking great care, thinking, “She took great care to hang this wallpaper, and it’s nice and... and now she’s gone.” [00:03:41]
THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. And you’re putting up your own and (inaudible). (client affirms) And tearing down what she had, and putting up what you blocked\/(inaudible).
CLIENT: Yeah, that’s it! It’s so... I don’t know. Is this what it is? I mean... I’m thinking, I don’t know. I’m just saying, and thinking, like... Well, I don’t know. I mean, like I watched... There is a show called Vice, where the host... I don’t know ","P1-N4002D1":"if you know the show. Close (ph) to the host, there is this documentor, I don’t know, documentorist? Documentary filmmaker? And journalist. (therapist responds) And he gets these just amazing stories, so it’s on Showtime, and he goes in-depth, it’s a half hour, and he’s always ","P1-N4002D2":"on location with some strange coupled stories that just aren’t covered by big media, right? [00:04:45]
THERAPIST: Yeah, based on fiscal policy, austerity measures, and all that.
CLIENT: Yes, yes, yes. And so... And I look and think... Yeah. So you have people who aren’t working, but they come up with my issue, right? I’m not 23 anymore; I’m 44 and not working, and thinking, and this... I don’t know, I’m looking and thinking, “What the hell ","P1-N400351":"is my problem? What is my problem? Where did things, way long time ago, get off the rails, where I somehow wasn’t (ph) following the normal trajectory? Which is a good trajectory, I mean...
THERAPIST: And you like it.
CLIENT: But I like it! (therapist affirms) So I think, “Okay, I like to teach that.” I like driving places, I like meeting new people, I like being on stage, I like the positive feedback... (pause) But in terms of... (pause) like somehow having some adventure, or being on the edge, or some ","P1-N4004B1":"energy, I don’t have it. Like, I feel like there is this... feeling of being in a big house, and all of a sudden, like looking toward the future and my parents getting older and I’m far away, and I don’t have kids and like, all these things. It’s like... What’s going on? [00:15:06]
THERAPIST: Like a little ritualistic?
CLIENT: Yeah, you know the feeling of it. I’m thinking, for years now, I felt like I’ve just sort of taken a shower in a shower! So I’m stuck (ph), you know? It’s not like I’ve... I’m... out really trying to get sand off myself or saltwater off of myself.
THERAPIST: I see what you’re saying.
CLIENT: And thinking, wow... (pause) Hmm. (pause) I don’t know. It feels... very... domestic. So like, one of the things (ph), it was like, going out to dinner doesn’t excite me. (pause) You know, so like, what’s going on? Like what’s going on? Like what things (inaudible) equal ","P1-N400571":"out (ph)? You know. So I think, “Well.” Does all of this lead up (ph) to like Bruins versus Penguins? Like, well, yeah, because that’s good, that’s great, psychological. You know, there is enough sports (inaudible), you sort of figure out... But then there is the game itself, ","P1-N400572":"right? So there is all this... as usual like, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk nonstop. It doesn’t affect me personally, really... [00:18:40]
THERAPIST: Yeah. They’re not that same...
CLIENT: Yeah! It’s like David Cross is just... you know, rounder. And the mom, she’s like... she’s starting to look elderly. (pause) So anyway... (therapist affirms) So it’s like, Wow! Yikes! This is... Michael Cera looks the same, but... (pause) So anyway, I’m watching ","P1-N400651":"that, whatever it is, seeing people get older, trying to into the story line, also aware of the fact that these people (ph) are still stuck and it’s ten years later. [00:23:56]
THERAPIST: (inaudible), yeah.
CLIENT: And then I go upstairs and like, as soon as I get into bed, this is the thing, this has been going on for a long time. Like, whatever else is going on, as soon as I get into bed, all of a sudden it hits me, it’s like getting into a coffin, right? There is a sense of... Like, okay. Now ","P1-N400691":"you have to go to sleep, Barbara is there, what do I have? (therapist responds) It’s like... And there is a sense, I’m not sure if I literally think it, but maybe I’m feeling it, the sense of like, the number of nights one gets into bed is finite. There will be a last time you get into bed.
THERAPIST: But yeah, you’re confronted with some sort of like, this isn’t going to last forever. Also it sounds like it’s a very introspective kind of moment there, where you’re kind of going, “What does all this meaning to me?” (pause) “Somebody’s going ","P1-N4006D1":"to be here later, sleeping in this spot and I’m going to be gone.”
CLIENT: Yeah, that’s it! I mean, and... well, so here, too, now, now, now, yeah, you’re talking, and listening to talking (inaudible), you know. This is not my house! This isn’t (inaudible) life (ph)!
THERAPIST: Yeah, what?
CLIENT: So I was thinking, you know, when I was in high school it wasn’t that (inaudible). (pause) I thought... well, you see it through the view of, you know, T. D. Jakes (ph) and energy. You look towards adults and think, “Oh, that’s what adults sometimes say. They have this stuff, ","P1-N400731":"but now they’re...,” right? And now I look (chuckles) and I think, “Hmm! I might be actually, you know, older than they (inaudible). (therapist responds) [00:26:34]
THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. There is nothing like, pressing on you to make that kind of move, some sort of... Because I think what you find is that there is an anxiety that comes with kind of looking and kind of wondering about, you know, things like what do I want to do? You know, what is it that I want ","P1-N4007D1":"to do, and the wondering and the imagining of, “Can I do it?” It brings up a lot.
CLIENT: Thinking about this film... so it’s... it’s called A Taste of Cherry, it’s Abbas Kiarostami. So this guy... So it takes place in Tehran, right? On the outskirts of Tehran. Normal life. Somehow he wants to end it, right? So he disappears, everyone is looking for him. And this ","P1-N400831":"old guy finds him, right? He does kill himself (ph) and, I don’t know if you’ve seen the film (therapist replies in the negative), but... So Abbas Kiarostami is just a phenomenal filmmaker.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) I have to stop, but... I know, before you started, I was just thinking about one thing, the... I was thinking about your comment about, you know like you can, sometimes life can feel a bit like, these days can feel like, that comfortable showering experience, but there is nothing ","P1-N400931":"kind of to wash off. That in some way, I mean, I do think that... It seems to me like, one thing that you’re describing is like... and I think that’s kind of representative in like your interest in math, is some sort of meaning, you know? Some sort of, a way that your life... I was thinking ","P1-N400932":"about it, maybe because of your discussion about the wallpaper, but as like, your life having like an artistic quality, a creative artistic quality to it, the aesthetic of your life, in a way. What is your life going to mean, and what are you going to leave, what are you going to leave behind? Wanting ","P1-N400933":"to have something that feels like that, but there is an anxiety, I think, that confronts you when you go... I think it does anybody, you know? But it confronts you when you think about what you want to create from your life. [00:42:15]
CLIENT: Somehow, I have this idea of like, if you... There is something decrepit about matter. I don’t mean to sound eastern when I say this, because I’m not being eastern when I say it, but this notion of it being transitory can be very upsetting to just sort of think of, “Well, what ","P1-N4009B1":"do you leave behind? Is that all you did, was that? Is that the point, you leave stuff behind?” (therapist responds) Instead, thinking like, there are always these access points of energy, right? There are some, but what really is going on is energy (therapist affirms), and you have various access ","P1-N4009B2":"points to it and... so that allows for sort of regeneration and that allows for the idea of hope in some way, because someone’s doing something big or small or off-track or something, there is always this energy. It’s there, you can glimpse it. (therapist affirms) Somehow that lasts, and ","P1-N4009B3":"that’s what one is always connected to, and it’s a matter of being in touch with it or not. [00:45:25]
THERAPIST: Oh, listen, let me just give you a heads up that I’m going to be, I’m taking my vacation plans are going to be that I’m going to be taking July 4, which falls on a Thursday through July 14, back the 15th of July.
CLIENT: All right, Monday July 15th.
THERAPIST: I’ll remind you, but I just wanted to let you know.
CLIENT: That might coincide, because I think I’m going to be heading home (inaudible), I’ll probably be in that area of (inaudible).
THERAPIST: Oh, is that right? Back to New Mexico?
CLIENT: Yeah. It’s a dirty heap! (ph) (therapist laughs) Take care!
