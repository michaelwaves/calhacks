TITLE: Client "Ma", Session February 20, 2014: Client discusses vulnerability when communicating with therapist.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses vulnerability when communicating with therapist.
CLIENT: Thanks for (inaudible at 0:00:04) this meeting this morning.
THERAPIST: Sure. Sure. Glad this could work out.
CLIENT: Yeah, me too.
THERAPIST: Oh that’s just (delayed) (ph). (pause)
CLIENT: Oh it’s a pretty good thing that, you know, (inaudible at 0:00:31). I don’t know. (sigh) (pause) When I get like that, it just feels like (pause) it feels like my mind is like splitting apart. And it gets very scary.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:01:14]
CLIENT: (pause) (inaudible at 0:02:26) (pause) The part of my mind is kind of like – think through things and to get me to calm down. It’s still sort of like racing, but it doesn’t give me direction. (pause) A bit chilled like.
THERAPIST: Do you want me to turn it down?
CLIENT: Okay, down.
THERAPIST: Good?
CLIENT: (chuckle) (pause) I’ll have to find another cardigan, like this winter.
THERAPIST: Right. I can also have the heat on when it’s 12 degrees outside; when I can (laughter) feel that cold air that comes in through the window.
CLIENT: Oh yeah, and it’s like – it’s probably 40 today. (pause) Yeah. (pause) Yeah, it’s rather tired. (pause) [0:03:44)]-[0:05:00]
THERAPIST: What are you referring to that you do to make yourself less vulnerable?
CLIENT: You know, some things that are maladaptive and some things that are better. (laughter) I try to get enough sleep, and I had to like (inaudible at 0:07:04) all the good people, and type their work and all of these – I feel like my whole life is oriented toward not having this happen. (chuckle) (pause)
THERAPIST: I feel like, with almost everything else that you do is there’s a task of trying to take care of yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And days like yesterday or today, that doesn’t happen?
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [0:08:15]-[0:10:15] I have [mood spray’s] (ph) shaken up. I don’t know what to do about that. I pretty (skeptic) (ph). (pause) (inaudible at 0:11:03) (sigh)
THERAPIST: I imagine you feel kind of mixed or of two minds about whether I can like take care of you in some useful way.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (chuckle) You know, my first thought was, “Yeah I’m pretty sure that you can’t.” And my second thought was, “Well why am I here?” And so, yeah. (laughter) I think you’re probably right. (pause) [0:12:03]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:12:52)
CLIENT: I don’t know what to do.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) [0:13:52]
CLIENT: I think talking to you did help last night though.
THERAPIST: Sure. (pause) Do you have one without (inaudible at 0:14:37]? (pause)
CLIENT: In some ways I think that, you know, (inaudible at 0:15:03], like am I breaking it? (pause) Yeah, I’m sure like, I guess talking about him probably helps some. I don’t really know. (pause) [0:16:03] (pause)
THERAPIST: Oh, of course it is. (pause) Are you sort of having a reaction and feeling horrified of having it that?
CLIENT: I don’t know. (crying) (pause) [0:17:09]-[0:18:09] I don’t understand (crying).
THERAPIST: That sounds like a battle, you know it’s like, when you’re feeling really horrible and miserable; probably like you really want to die. (pause) I think you’re actually, you know, among other things, quite terrified that I’m going to have an explanation for this, because ","P1-N4004D1":"in some way, that would put some of it back on you, you think.
CLIENT: Mm. (inaudible at 0:19:26] I mean I’m definitely terrified that you will expect me to have an explanation. (pause)
THERAPIST: I imagine also that I’ll just expect you to do different or be different. (pause) [0:20:26]-[0:21:26] (pause) My sense is that when you said to me a minute ago, that it was – let me note that one down.
CLIENT: Okay. (laughter)
THERAPIST: That it was probably helpful to make it partly my problem too; that there was some relief in saying that, and I think also some horror probably?
CLIENT: Yeah, it feels like a pretty shitty thing to do, you know.
THERAPIST: It seems to me, pretty close to what we were talking about yesterday? [0:22:27]
CLIENT: Can you remind me?
THERAPIST: Sure. Absolutely. You had come in really anxious about telling me you had been really upset by what we had talked about on Tuesday, especially my saying I thought I was wrong. You were I think really sort of worried that was going to make me feel horrible, and like I had been wrong, in a ","P1-N4005D1":"way that I would sort of have some reaction to – a reaction that would like cause a sort of a breakdown between you and me, and our being able to kind of talk together about you. You remember that? [0:23:34]
CLIENT: Yeah, I remember that.
THERAPIST: Yeah; true. (pause) And this doesn’t seem that different to me, where you’re (pause) I guess I am as in that way when you say something like, “You know, it’s probably helpful to make this partly your problem.” That there’s a part of me that goes, “Oh ","P1-N400611":"my f****ing God.” (chuckle) You know like, that was a really shitty thing to say; I am horrible. And probably (imperiled) (ph) that that must have been a really shitty thing to hear. You know, talked you must be feeling completely horrible. (pause)
CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:24:57) (pause) (inaudible at 0:25:04) (pause) Anyway, I feel really bad about asking other people to carry this for me. I feel bad about asking you to (inaudible at 0:25:21). But, you know, I do it, but I don’t like it. I don’t know, I just feel like (pause) I necessarily ","P1-N400631":"mind to carry him. I don’t like having to say that I can’t do it.
THERAPIST: Yeah. You know I think you were saying yesterday that you think like guilt and shame kind of go together?
CLIENT: (laughter)
THERAPIST: I think this is sort of ground zero.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [0:26:00]-[0:28:00] (pause) I think (renovating) (ph) it’s not like work. It’s like – yeah. (pause)
THERAPIST: Yeah it’s really terrible, because it’s frustrating.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I’m just trying to – yeah, trying to pull myself out of it, but I can’t. (pause) [0:29:22] It sort of feels like sleeping on a bad mattress, and I keep turning and trying to find a place that will be more comfortable. And like, there’s not place that is comfortable.
THERAPIST: Right. (pause) This seems a like old start of it, but I think you’re talking about (inaudible at 0:30:19)
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Trying to find a place that’s slightly more comfortable. (pause) [0:31:19]-[0:34:19] (pause)
THERAPIST: Well, I guess I feel a little bit (pause) what’s the word I thought, because actually it does seem some (inaudible at 0:35:14) does I think, seem sort of clearer to me, or I feel like I do have more of an explanation for it. But I’m concerned, because I think (pause) sort of ","P1-N400751":"explaining to you what I think, will feel or may feel to you kind of both a bit retaliatory, and also alienating.
CLIENT: It helps maybe. Can we talk about it tomorrow?
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: Because I always want to know the answer. (voice change) And I know that that’s not what you’re saying. But sort of the (laughter)
THERAPIST: Well, you know, the truth is, that is a chunk of an answer in my mind; it’s like -
CLIENT: Fix my problems; be better at (inaudible at 0:38:11)
THERAPIST: (chuckle) (pause) I think part of where you’re stuck is that on one side, being terrified, guilty and ashamed of putting any of this on anyone else – I don’t know (inaudible at 0:38:50). (pause) At the same time, I think, you’re really quite desperate for he and I ","P1-N400831":"to carry some of it for you, which means, I think in part, to know a little something about what it’s like. Not just as you could explain it, but as you could for example, show me (pause) in showing me that causes don’t matter; explanations don’t matter; that it wasn’t happening ","P1-N400832":"yesterday doesn’t matter; that nothing I say in the moment will make it better. [0:40:09]
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [0:41:00] (pause) I don’t know whether that helped. (pause) [0:42:00][0:43:00] I don’t know what to say. (pause)
THERAPIST: I have this small thing, that I’m sorry it’s a logistical thing that occurred to me. I don’t know if this matters or not, but as a one-time thing, I’m scheduled to go see Michele Lee tomorrow at 5:15. Is it going to bother you to see him?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Sure. (pause) Yeah, I mean, I could have him come a few minutes later, but it doesn’t matter. [0:44:05]
CLIENT: No, it’s fine.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Thank you. (pause) Thanks for the heads up.
THERAPIST: Sure. We need to stop for now.
CLIENT: Okay.
