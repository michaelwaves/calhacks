TITLE: Client "Ma", Session March 05, 2014: Client discusses the difficulty of sharing mental and emotional health information with family and friends.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the difficulty of sharing mental and emotional health information with family and friends.
CLIENT: Hi.
THERAPIST: Hi. (pause)
CLIENT: (sigh) So James, (pause) while I was in the hospital, as other than the (inaudible at 00:00:24), sending out like a daily update to family. And so he sent me (pause) he like copied me on sort of the last one yesterday. And (pause) (sigh) it seemed to me that was a lot more detailed than ones ","P1-N4000F1":"in the past. So like stuff about my psychiatrist -
THERAPIST: [You certainly liked that] (ph).
CLIENT: Why? (chuckle)
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)
CLIENT: Saying that like (inaudible at 00:01:06), and like (sigh) basically said that I would not have chosen to tell my mom for example, or James’ mom, or you know, my little brother. Like I love them, but it’s not necessarily even that I don’t want them to know, but I didn’t ","P1-N400171":"know that they – like I didn’t know that when I was having these conversations with James, that anything in the conversations was fair game, which is pretty much how it’s panned out. (pause) (sigh)
THERAPIST: Last night. [00:02:48]
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Then I checked e-mail today, and James posted like, you know, clearly upset, and he then before I went to bed, he was like, “I’m very upset at the like agitation that I did something inappropriate by sending these updates.”
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:07:00] (pause)
CLIENT: And so when I take James’ mom out, she’ll have very much and hold very much; our dyer relationship over ten years has been like her sort of wanting to like be a mother to me, and me sort of like (pause) tiptoeing into being able to share things with her, and trusting her. And a part ","P1-N400301":"of that is like, she really doesn’t understand the all of this. It’s not that she – she’s really sympathetic, but she doesn’t – it doesn’t resonate with her; it doesn’t make sense. [00:08:19]
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)
CLIENT: And – (pause) [00:09:00] (pause) You know, and my mom, I know will sort of use this to further like blur the lines between me and her. And say, “Oh, I did this thing too. I mean we’re exactly the same.” And I just don’t want to have that conversation with her, and ","P1-N400361":"tell her why I was in the hospital in the first place.
THERAPIST: You know, I imagine you sort of like you was afraid what this was going to seem like to her. (pause)
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know whether like the last time I was in Frederick I just – it feels like sharing like the externals of the situation, or versus the internal. Like when I was Frederick last time, I think I was not sharing the internal parts with James either. So he doesn’t necessarily ","P1-N4003C1":"see a difference. You know, I was doing UCT, so like nobody had access (chuckle) to my (interior) (ph) like that, including me. [00:10:19] (laughter)
THERAPIST: There wasn’t a whole lot apparently. (laughter)
CLIENT: Yes, exactly. (laughter)
THERAPIST: At least that we can know about it. (laughter) (pause)
CLIENT: (sigh) (pause) Like (pause) I started to feel like James was upset with me because I wasn’t successful in my effort not to react in any way until I could assess what the best way of approaching the situation was. I literally had an involuntary exclamation when I read the e-mail. (overlapping ","P1-N400441":"voices) And that, and he was like, “What is it? What is it? What’s wrong?” And I couldn’t not answer then. [00:11:27]
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: Because he knew I was reading that e-mail.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I feel like that’s what he’s upset about.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Or (pause) (sigh) you know I didn’t say I was angry with him; I didn’t say I was angry with what he’d done. I said I was upset about what had happened. (coughing)
THERAPIST: And even that.
CLIENT: And that was – yeah. Actually, I didn’t say I was upset about what had happened, I said that like I wouldn’t have chosen to share that much, which is not the same thing at all. (pause) I feel like my problem is really bottling up emotions; this isn’t going to help very ","P1-N400541":"much. [00:12:34] (laughter)
THERAPIST: I felt the same. You must feel like this means you’ve been right.
CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah. (laughter) (pause) (coughing)
THERAPIST: I think it’s even more particular than that. (pause) [00:13:00] That the point of keeping people out, or away from what’s going on, especially like bad things you feel, I think has been because you anticipated that like that would give them a kind of – that would give other ","P1-N4005A1":"people a kind of access to you that would be very dangerous. (pause) That would sort of – that they would react to in their own way, or from their own frame of reference without taking yours into account, in a way that would be very hurtful to you.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean I don’t think this is like what you’re describing with James’ mom, your mom and James are all sort of different types of examples of that I think (pause) [00:14:00] (pause) that it might seem clear like that.
CLIENT: Mm-mm.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Like your mom makes it about her. (pause) (coughing)
CLIENT: I have like a tickle. (coughing) (pause)
THERAPIST: That’s okay. Well they each have sort of (pause) (coughing) agendas that feel very destructive or hurtful to you.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [00:15:00] (pause) (sigh) Could you (pause) see why James is upset? I mean I sort of see it clearly enough that I can’t push past it to get to how I’m upset. (pause) But I don’t know what to do about that. (pause)
THERAPIST: Well it kind of struck me is that there’s really no room for both of you to be upset, somehow. In other words, I mean I think (pause) this is a very sort of in part a construction on yours, or maybe both of yours; I don’t know. [00:16:13] (pause)
CLIENT: Yeah, absolutely.
THERAPIST: And where at least in your sense of it, he can’t be upset that, you know, you’re mad at him, and (pause)
CLIENT: Yeah I imagine that -
THERAPIST: he was trying to do something he thought was helpful at least consciously, (pause) and that you’re angry, and disappointed anyway, (pause) and, you know, where he can feel that way, but also kind of see where you’re coming from. It sounds like it’s way too kind of jammed ","P1-N400741":"together. (pause)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Does that -
CLIENT: It’s like I’m trying very hard to have both of those in my head at once, but like I can’t one, because that they both make sense. But like the one pushes out the other; I feel like I can’t sort of (pause) [00:17:54] you know, if I think too hard about like the ways ","P1-N4007A1":"in which it’s reasonable for James to be upset, and like well it’s just reasonable for him to sort of feel hurt about how (pause) (sigh) that (pause) I’m giving him a hard time trying to like both take care of me and take care of our family in this way.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah you have sort of a split. (pause)
CLIENT: Which is a strange feeling, because it’s very different from not being able to conceptualize it.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Like (pause) yeah. (pause) Thank you for not explaining to me how both of those can be true. (laughter) Sorry. I’ve had a lot of people explain stuff to me last week. [00:19:08]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Like, “Yeah; no, no, I got it.” (pause)
THERAPIST: In a way, the irony is, as far as I can tell, like that’s why we all have jobs, is because of the difference. (pause) [00:20:00]
CLIENT: So today is Ash Wednesday.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Which I don’t know how much you know about this, but I’m going to go to church this evening, and they’re going to take some ashes, and put them our forehead across, and say, “Remember that you are dust, and unto dust you shall return.”
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And it’s virtually impossible for me to do that in a healthy way. Like I just – I get swallowed.
THERAPIST: Yeah, like you’re just talking about in a way.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (pause) [00:21:00] So you know, (pause) a lot of times, people give up chocolate, or something like not eating it on Fridays. So I decided I was going to stop self-injuring myself, or stop injuring during Lent, and that’s going to be my discipline.
THERAPIST: And Lent goes ‘til Easter?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Which is -
CLIENT: 40 days. (pause) It’s not really one I can talk about with people. People are like, “What are you giving up for Lent?” Like that’s something people actually ask, which I don’t know, I feel like I’m only now realizing like how glaringly inappropriate that question ","P1-N400A41":"is. [00:22:02] (laughter) (pause)
THERAPIST: Then you make your point.
CLIENT: (laughter) (pause) Camilla, one of the priests at my church visited.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I like her a lot. (sigh) (pause) I think she didn’t quite get like (pause) she sort of like gets really excited, like talks about theology, and gets really excited about it. And I do the same thing; it’s like that’s very fun. But so like she visited the first time, and she ","P1-N400AE1":"visited twice briefly. [00:23:28]
THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean it seems like you’re sort of sandwiching between talking about it and conveying it.
CLIENT: Yes. [00:27:03] (pause) (sigh) You know in some ways like, I talking about it, because I feel like (pause) (sigh) I feel like that helps me sort of get my head around it or have some power over it. (pause) But it also seems to maybe leave out everything essential. (chuckle) Or (inaudible at ","P1-N400BE1":"00:27:33). (pause) [00:28:33] (pause) (sigh)
THERAPIST: Well I think you have two worries about conveying it. One is sort of the word that’s just come up. I mean in a way, it seems to me like that’s actually what James did more than you wanted. You know the level of detail which he was describing; it felt more like he was conveying ","P1-N400C01":"it in some way. [00:29:13] (pause)
CLIENT: I don’t think so; I think really more of what something is there like he was conveying a lot of like sort of theories about it, and I feel like (pause) I mean, one of the problems that I run into with James, is that like I’ll tell him about something that like I’ve talked about ","P1-N400C21":"with you, or that I’ve talked about with somebody else; he’s like, “Maybe this is what’s going on.” And he’ll just get stuck on that.
THERAPIST: Clearly, I (inaudible at 00:30:17) only because it (pause) it lines up for me in sort of the way that it’s unending kind of parallel to like, you know, the humanities versus the heart scientists. Like, “You know, today it’s one thing, and tomorrow it might be something ","P1-N400C81":"else. I’m going to revise and update.” Whereas like, “This is how it works.”
CLIENT: (laughter)
THERAPIST: I know that’s not – (pause)
CLIENT: It’s close anyway. (chuckle) (pause) I don’t know, but I think – I think actually what I’m sort of objecting to, I’m not getting mad at I don’t know.
THERAPIST: Sounds to me like what you’re describing is the sort of provisional aspect of what you are saying gets lost.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: And so it’s kind of like you’re held to whatever you said? [00:31:23]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Or whatever the idea was?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: In some way that (pause) I guess leads to (pause) like it’s both misunderstanding and a kind of shaming. (pause)
CLIENT: Yeah. But I think that like I’m sort of trying to revise, because I think that that’s like what I’m upset about, but it’s clearly not why I’m upset, if that makes sense. Like I – (pause) I think you’re right that it’s some sort of (sigh) (pause) ","P1-N400DE1":"some like (pause) I don’t know, it’s like some part of me that I (pause) would not necessarily have chosen to give to people. [00:32:31] (pause)
THERAPIST: That’s all right. If my – what I was going to say that, I think for you there are two dangers in that; one which is what happened, which is that (pause) people that will use that according to their own agendas in ways that are very hurtful.
CLIENT: Yeah. So if this awful, why would I want to share that with anybody? But I think [00:33:40] (pause)
THERAPIST: I mean it doesn’t seem like (pause) you seem to sort of feel a bit more anxious, and upset, and a little pressure even when you came in, knowing that you (pause) were going to tell me about what just happened. And, I think in a way relieved that (pause) or less fear than you often ","P1-N400E81":"are, that what you were saying was going to either, you know, hurt me or that I was going to respond in a way that was kind of using it in some way to hurt you. (pause) I mean you’re still probably pretty worried about those things.
CLIENT: I don’t know. I don’t feel like it.
THERAPIST: Oh good. (pause) [You think you’ll ask your mom about that] (ph)? (pause) [00:35:00]-[00:36:00] (pause)
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I don’t – (pause) I don’t think that (pause) that I’m worried going forward, because (pause) I cannot tell James things. Like (pause) I can’t like (pause) (figure) (ph) him out, and so I just don’t (pause) [00:37:00] (pause) you know, but ","P1-N400EE1":"I – that vulnerability is just there. I’m like yeah, it was always there, but now I have to like pay attention to it. (chuckle) (pause) I don’t know what I’m going to do. (pause) Probably just try not to think about it or anything. (pause) [00:38:00] (pause)
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) [00:40:00] (pause)
CLIENT: I think James was really angry; not like about this, but about my being in the hospital. (pause)
THERAPIST: Which means I think that (inaudible at 00:40:45) that either he maybe was right. I mean because (pause) I too also wonder if you (pause) I don’t entirely – well, I wonder about the extent to which you feel like you’ve done something terribly wrong, or you deserve sort ","P1-N400F61":"of maybe like really angry or punishing, because you will allow yourself to really be taken care of. And to kind of (pause) like (pause) I don’t know.
CLIENT: Yeah. No, I mean I think for me saying is that’s probably true. I (pause) I’m not sure whether it would have come up if I hadn’t sort of seen James now, like after I came out, James dealing with the stress of it for him. (pause)
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) I guess when you say that, I think of what more of my concern is like (pause) when he conveys that he’s angry, and it seems like part of the problem is you feel (pause) a part of you that – of course even though you should be.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) No, yeah, that seems so obvious to me that it only just occurred to me that you were questioning that. (chuckle)
THERAPIST: Right. (pause) [00:43:00] (pause) We should stop now.
CLIENT: Sure.
