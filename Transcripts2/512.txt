TITLE: Client "A", Session March 18, 2014: Client discusses their difficulty expressing emotion.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses their difficulty expressing emotion.
CLIENT: Do you have – if the tape is running, is the iPad able to have another window functioning simultaneously? It’s not important. OK. So, we were going to talk a little bit about process. And I was laughing about this after I left on Thursday last week, because that is what I imagined ","P1-N4000B1":"we would do when I first showed up and have been – I mean, maybe – I’m not sure how explicit it was, and I’m not sure how calculated your aversion to doing this may or may not have been, but – and it was funny. [00:01:15] It was funny, all of a sudden, three years in, to ","P1-N4000B2":"have what I – what was my referent when you were talking about, you know, instrumental interventions. Suddenly, we were at ten (ph).
THERAPIST: Right, and the other day, it felt like I was saying, “Oh yeah, and by the way...”
CLIENT: “And by the way,” yeah, “We might as well...”
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:02:38) talked about it.
CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So, yeah...
THERAPIST: Yeah, being (inaudible at 00:02:45).
CLIENT: Yeah, I’m sure it’s easier. I mean, you know, I guess that’s part of the joke too, is that, you know, is – but when I was feeling frustrated, I can say that, you know, when I was kind of, I don’t know, feeling a little bit of cross-purposes, what I imagined would ","P1-N4001F1":"be the alternative was something like this. [00:03:13] Whatever, it’s fine. Other things. (pause) There is a – the departmental secretary. So, you know, there are so many hierarchies at Harvard, it’s hard to keep track of all of them. But one of the hierarchies is, you know, kind of ","P1-N4001F2":"bureaucratic, you know, on the bureaucratic side of the hierarchy and on academic or the scholastic side of the faculty of the enterprise. [00:04:04]
THERAPIST: [She and Harvard] (ph) being partners?
CLIENT: ... partners at the time. So, she was the, I think she was the secretary, executive assistant or something, of the old chair. Not Arthur Kleinman, but...
THERAPIST: Happened in med school?
CLIENT: ... but Byron Good. Right. So, at the end of the Department of Social Medicine, there were a bunch of anthropologists, just one of the interesting features of this particular department. [00:05:06] And I think she was their secretary, and then she became the department’s kind of bureaucratic ","P1-N400291":"person. And then, at some point, for reasons that I don’t know about but must’ve been significant, she was kind of replaced. So she remained in a relatively inferior position underneath Jennifer (ph), who seemed to have taken over around some time in 2005.
THERAPIST: (long pause) What do you mean when you said that this is being fogged off on you?
CLIENT: The disappointment. I think that sounds less descriptive than I would’ve want it to be, but... [00:11:01]
THERAPIST: You may have to...
CLIENT: ...they – you know, it – I was offered a position. I talked to Jennifer, the Senior Administrator about it. She said – all systems seemed go, and then they got back to me and said, you know, “We’re very happy to make you this other appointment.” And it turns ","P1-N4003B1":"out not to be useful to me, you know, at all academically, you know, when the premise was that I would get X (ph). So, and then I talked to the, you know, Chair of the Department, and she’s, like, “Oh, you know, it doesn’t matter. It’s no big deal.” And it turns out to ","P1-N4003B2":"matter a great deal.
THERAPIST: Right. OK. So this was the instructor versus the lecturer kind of thing?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, electorship was not useful and I knew it. I mean, you know, I – we’ve probably talked about it the day that it came in. You know, it was apparent to me that something was up, and that something could only be annoying. And indeed, it turned out to be very annoying, ","P1-N4003F1":"indeed. So that’s what I meant. [00:12:00]
THERAPIST: (pause) So, even though this has in a way nothing to do with Nikki, it’s a pretty sore spot?
CLIENT: Except that, you know, I’m having an identical response to the thank-you notes, which are not in a sore spot in the slightest, indeed. You know, I mean, I’m having the same reaction to the thank-you notes and I’m having the same reaction to the job – I mean, you know, ","P1-N400431":"it’s like there’s something going on here that, you know, significantly transcends this particular, rather sore spot or not transcends a spot, it might be a mixed metaphor, but you know what I’m saying. I mean, it’s not – it really – on the one hand, yes. It’s ","P1-N400432":"a sore spot. [00:13:04] I can understand, you know, theoretically why I would be reluctant to, you know, enter into this complexity and not really sure at some level how to respond, given that it’s certainly not Nikki’s fault in any way.
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: You know? I mean, it’s not her fault. It’s not, you know, Esther, the Department Chair’s fault. You know, it’s not Frederick Paulson’s fault. It’s not Phil’s fault. It’s nobody’s fault, you know. It’s, like, “Well, you know, you ","P1-N400491":"got screwed, but it’s nobody’s fault.” And so, I’m aware at some level, I guess, of how inappropriate it would be for all of this, you know, no-faultness to somehow come to rest on Nikki, who I suspect has kind of gotten screwed by, you know, a system that doesn’t respond ","P1-N400492":"very well to, you know, meek, very nice, non-aggressive people. [00:14:13]
THERAPIST: I’m not sure...
CLIENT: ... be on totally different plains. I guess that’s what I’m puzzled...
THERAPIST: OK (ph), so you’re saying...
CLIENT: One of the things I’m puzzled about.
THERAPIST: ... your feeling about the thank-you notes is really quite different?
CLIENT: No. I mean...
CLIENT: My reaction to the thank-you notes...
THERAPIST: And doing the writing is the same...
CLIENT: ... is almost identical, but I don’t know. Yeah. These are people that I feel – there’s one – I don’t know. [00:15:02] I mean, I guess if I were pressed on it, I could come up with a scenario in which there’s kind of a slightly analogous situation, insofar, ","P1-N4005F1":"as the most pressing and urgent of the thank-you notes, which is the one that I began with today is to my parents’ old friend Deena (ph), who’s dying of cancer, actively and not willingly. You know, so she was diagnosed right before Grayson (ph) was born with Stage IV ovarian cancer, I can’t ","P1-N4005F2":"remember. And she was just talking and, you know, she’s a poet, widely published. It’s a little new age-y for my tastes, but, you know, very accomplished and well regarded. And she’s a psychotherapist, as well.
THERAPIST: Being (ph) so public?
CLIENT: Yeah. It’s, like, I don’t know why it seems so strange to me, but it’s – I have, I guess, a cultural aversion to those kind of things. At any rate, so we had an exchange about it. And she said, “Yeah, you know, I just want to get all of the work that I could possibly ","P1-N400651":"get done, done. And so, I’m going to have them do everything.” So she had chemo, and then she had surgery, and now she’s looking at another round of chemo. And she’s – my mother talked to her a couple days ago, I guess, and she’s just doing everything, and doing really ","P1-N400652":"badly, and feeling like complete shit. [00:17:01] And it’s hard for me to – I’m very surprised to find that it’s very difficult for me to figure out how to interact with her.
THERAPIST: A what?
CLIENT: ... and she never...
THERAPIST: I just didn’t hear you.
CLIENT: A bong.
THERAPIST: Oh, bong.
CLIENT: And she never acknowledged it. And I guess maybe that’s part of it. I thought it would be a cute thing and – because risks or anything like that, it’s risky, but she never acknowledged it. And I’m just not – I feel uncertain about it and I think that because that’s ","P1-N400731":"the most urgent for, you know, kind of life cycle reasons at this point, of all the thank-you notes. It’s always at the front of the row as possible, I guess, with my uncertainty or unease about this communication. [00:18:04] And I just postponed all of them, because as I recall, as I think about ","P1-N400732":"it, I didn’t really have any problem with any of the other ones.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, I guess I’m not – it’d make more sense to me, in terms of what we talked about, that you’d have trouble writing Nikki back. Having the – your frustration, your feeling of being fucked over, the sort of way that you’re also, you know, kind ","P1-N400771":"of being silenced about that, because nobody’s taking responsibility and because Nikki generally doesn’t have any, and she’s nice. [00:20:07] You know, that all feels (ph) familiar. I’m not clear about kind of where the struggle of anxiety is with. Deena? Was that her name? In ","P1-N400772":"that, I get that you’re sort of on uncertain footing with her, I guess is how it sounds. She never...
CLIENT: And she was very – I mean, she sent this – we had this very sweet communication. And I don’t know.
THERAPIST: You seem to have a clearer sense than I do of what might be making it difficult to write to her. Is it...
CLIENT: Well, I mean, I’m trying, just for the sake of argument, to create a taxonomy that might include it. And what – you’re a little dissatisfied, I guess, with the generality, you know, the degree of generalization that is required. [00:21:11] But I guess I’m seeing something ","P1-N4007D1":"that I identify as unease, and you’re responding, well – it’s the specific kind of unease that we’ve been talking about, you know, that involves anger, I guess. You know, and anger...
THERAPIST: Anger, injustice and...
CLIENT: Well, OK. Fine.
THERAPIST: ... feeling silenced.
CLIENT: Fine. Sure. I mean, you know, the anger has all these things associated with it. Outrage, maybe outrage is better, and, you know, your response to how – I mean, I suppose you could really stretch it and say, “Well, you know, getting terminal cancer is very unjust,” and, you ","P1-N400851":"know, you’re not quite sure how to relate and I’m – I [that makes up] (ph) the excess failure. [00:22:05] You know, and I am not quite sure how to relate to that injustice and how to compose myself in response to it. And the default reaction to that uncertainty or trouble or anxiety ","P1-N400852":"or, you know, kind of difficulty composing myself is to have difficulty composing in an expository sense as well, but I don’t know.
THERAPIST: You mean in that case, you’re sort of reacting about the injustice done to her.
CLIENT: Done to her, yeah. I mean, the injustice of the universe. I don’t know. That seems a little bit farfetched.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I don’t have the sense from things you said that – I mean, like, you’re upset, but not disturbed by what’s happened to her. I mean, it’s when you said so far that indicates, right (ph), it gives me a sense that...
CLIENT: I don’t know too much. [00:23:02]
THERAPIST: ... you’re sort of disturbed by it. I’m sort of agreeing with you that...
CLIENT: I...
THERAPIST: ... you know, that seems like...
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, a bit of a stretch. Seems like it is a stretch. It’s hard for me to imagine. And, you know, whenever you write something, you must imagine the other person, and what they look like, and who they are. And it’s – you know, like, what comes to mind, I guess, is thinking ","P1-N400951":"about my dad in the last phase, when, you know, he had no air and was swollen by the chemotherapy and all these things. So and – Deena is kind of a lipstick lesbian. She’s very, you know, well put together. She’s my mother’s age, she’s only 60. She’s very chic, and ","P1-N400952":"it gets pretty hard, like, to think of her hanging on by her fingernails like that. There’s some of that. There’s something there, but it feels like a very different thing. [00:24:03]
THERAPIST: Yeah, immediately.
CLIENT: Yeah, maybe this is not job applications per se, but these are all – all of these things must be done before the end of the week. You know, there’s no [cutting around] (ph). (00:25:00) (long pause) What’s – can I...
THERAPIST: Yeah, sure. Of course.
CLIENT: ...break in? What’s the complexity that you’re “Hmm-ing,” about?
THERAPIST: Well, at the moment, I’m sort of (pause) – I guess I am skeptical of the premise that there is some kind of general or, like, super-ordinate reason that you’re having trouble moving forward on these three projects involving writing, with, like... (00:26:39)
CLIENT: This is reminding me of a Rorschach test that I took, where it was just, like, this incredibly complex inkblot. And I think the expectation is that somebody would go through it, and they would say, “Oh, OK. Well, this reminds of that, and this reminds me of that, and this reminds me of ","P1-N400A31":"the other thing.” And...
THERAPIST: How big was the inkblot?
CLIENT: I don’t – I mean, it was, you know, it had a number of different facets to it. It’s like that – I don’t know. [00:27:01]
CLIENT: I remember them showing me, like, this is my recollection of it.
THERAPIST: I mean, the standard administration is, like, you know, they’re about that big.
CLIENT: Something, the blot itself...
THERAPIST: ... because the paper in there are usually – you do ten of them. And so you say, like, you know, say what...
CLIENT: OK.
THERAPIST: ... you know, what you think it reminds you of.
CLIENT: At any rate, well, this is my recollection, so it really doesn’t matter what it actually was, because I’m – but in my recollection at least, they showed it to me, and I said, “Well, you know, this looks like something.” And there were, I don’t know, 15 details ","P1-N400B91":"that were somehow integrated into the same split (ph).
THERAPIST: I mean, part of the reason I’m asking about the administration is because, I mean, it doesn’t matter a little bit in that, like – I mean, I know enough about how those things work. I don’t do that kind of testing, but I – you know, you sort of get trained in ","P1-N400BB1":"there and you see one of those boards (ph) when you’re starting out. And anyway, so, like, if it was the usual one, it helps – gives me context for your response.
CLIENT: Oh. [00:28:00] Well, I was having – I mean...
THERAPIST: What were you going to say?
CLIENT: I went to the counsel, and I was kind of having trouble working, [you know], shortly after my father died. And the guy I was seeing is a very nice guy, asked me if I would be willing to have an inkblot test administered by one of his students or interns or something. And so the guy administered ","P1-N400C11":"the test, and then – what was his last name? Donald something, I don’t know. He said, “Yeah, your response was very unusual, because of instead of saying...” apparently, you know, there was one very detailed card. And instead of identifying the individual parts, I integrated ","P1-N400C12":"all of them into one story. So, that just reminded me of this effort to find some grand, unified theory of, you know, all physical phenomenon related by the Big Bang. [00:29:03]
THERAPIST: Well, there may be a (inaudible at 00:29:10) theory, but, like, I guess I think of things tend to arrive kind of from the bottom up, you know, like...
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, I guess it’s just...
THERAPIST: And so when I’m thinking of what I’m trying to do and sort of – at this point, when I’m, sort of, you know, (inaudible at 00:29:32), but also going through my sense of your, like – the feeling you have or have expressed about Deena, and what’s going on ","P1-N400C91":"with her, and who she is, to see if I can get a sense of, like – I mean, I guess the clearest thing is that she sounds like sort of a vivacious...
CLIENT: Deena...
THERAPIST: ... lively person. [00:30:00]
CLIENT: My favorite story about Deena took place at a party in Northwestern in, like, 1968. And she had broken up with somebody and was very depressed. And so, like, for my parents, this party was to – you know, like, what they were doing the whole party was kind of trying to cheer her up. And ","P1-N400CF1":"so at some point, my father fell asleep on the couch, as he often did. And Deena kind of woke him up in the middle of the night and said, “Oh God, you know, I made these brownies and nobody wanted to eat them, and I’m so sad, and I’m so depressed, and nobody loves me.” And she ","P1-N400CF2":"was fucking with him.
THERAPIST: (laughing)
CLIENT: She put a lot of hash in these brownies. And he wakes up in the middle of the night, you know, like, 45 minutes later, and he’s completely (inaudible at 00:30:46) and he has no idea what’s going on. He just thinks it’s [fucking sick] (ph). (laughing) He didn’t speak to ","P1-N400D31":"her for, like, a year after that.
THERAPIST: Oh my God.
CLIENT: (laughing). Yeah. I mean, and whatever. She’s now [better of] (ph) a woman of 68, and that’s all of these other ways of expressing herself, since she was, like, in her 20’s. [00:31:13] And anyway, so, yeah, she was a very vivacious person. She’s always been a bit of trip, ","P1-N400D71":"you know. She has all of this stuff about goddesses and I mean, you know, she’s new age-y. She’s new age-y. So not – some of what she writes is not quite tralatitious (ph). She’s a wonderful translator, and she’s translated some very – she did Paul Celan. I mean, ","P1-N400D72":"she did some, you know, very well-known people to do a translation. You need to get the copy-write so they don’t, you know, give it to just anybody.
THERAPIST: Yeah, it does seem like a sort of injustice. I mean, she’s not that old, and it’s – you know, sounds like she got diagnosed...
CLIENT: Very late.
THERAPIST: ... at a Stage IV.
CLIENT: Very late, yeah. Yeah.
THERAPIST: She’s got to fight it, but...
CLIENT: Yeah, it’s kind of hopeless. It’s hopeless, fighting it. My mother, I talked to my mother last night or this morning or something, and she’s, like, you know, she’s a little traumatized too, I’m sure, helping (ph) my dad through it. Anyway, so... [00:33:02]
THERAPIST: And you said you had a very nice interaction with her, though?
CLIENT: Yeah. Very – you know, she didn’t write back after the bong, but that’s her prerogative. I mean, whatever. It was kind of a far out gift, and maybe she just didn’t want to get into all that. I didn’t feel dissed. We haven’t had communication since then, but ","P1-N400E91":"I didn’t feel particularly dissed.
THERAPIST: And the interaction with her was, like – did she – I don’t know where she is now, like, did she come...
CLIENT: Idaho.
THERAPIST: Oh, OK. So she didn’t come...
CLIENT: No, no. No, I mean, she’s can’t. She can’t travel.
THERAPIST: Yeah. No, absolutely, I just...
CLIENT: She can’t travel.
THERAPIST: ... I wasn’t clear, like...
CLIENT: No, no, no. But she sends – she wrote some poems for him. She wrote some, like, you know, very brief, four line children’s poems for him, very sweet ones, very, very sweet ones. And I asked Isaac (ph), my nephew, to illustrate a few of them, and he did two or three. So, I mean, I ","P1-N400F91":"don’t know Marshall (ph). [00:34:03] I mean, it’s...
THERAPIST: Yeah, there’s nothing...
CLIENT: It doesn’t have to be the same category of thing, and I don’t – I guess it’s interesting, in some sense, that I’m looking for, as I often do, for, you know, some really...
THERAPIST: No, it doesn’t have to be the same category. I mean, it’s...
CLIENT: ... grand, encompassing thing. It’s just these are the three things that feel most urgent to me, right now. That all three of them, I feel some remorse over not having superseded whatever it is that’s interfering. And, you know, when talking about the – I mean, I guess, you ","P1-N401011":"know, in a more kind of nitty-gritty sense, I really haven’t been successful at all at sitting down to do the job applications or at least I’ve made, you know, the college try at the thank-you notes. So if I’m going to talk about any kind (laughing) of processes, this is what I have ","P1-N401012":"in hand, you know.
THERAPIST: All right. Also, [this is how I feel it] (ph), is this – could this be the last thing you write to her? [00:35:02]
CLIENT: Yeah, easily.
THERAPIST: Or the last communication...
CLIENT: Easily.
THERAPIST: ... you have with her?
CLIENT: It could. It could. I’m writing a letter to her, I’m not sending her a card.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: Just about what’s going on. I just didn’t want to be limited by the card, the format of a card. But it’s hard. And if I had written it three months ago, we would’ve had a dialog, and I wouldn’t have – feel so much responsibility, I guess.
THERAPIST: Three months ago was before was diagnosed?
CLIENT: No, no, no. Three months ago was three months ago, shortly after she sent this package.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:35:47).
CLIENT: Yeah, so we took a picture of Grayson, and things that she (inaudible 00:35:53). And what we’re doing for everybody, but this is – this one is harder.
THERAPIST: [Hadn’t start then] (ph). [00:36:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, genuinely, well, you know what I – yeah. So how does it feel (inaudible 00:36:13). I’m having a little trouble getting in touch with it, which may be interesting and it may just be not interesting. I don’t know, like, there’s a distinct feeling ","P1-N4011D1":"of sadness, and I’m not quite feeling it, as I talk to you about it. I feel more distanced from that sensation than, for example, the sensation of being outraged about the bait and switch with the – which, some of it feels very awful to me, like, why should I have any difficulty with a real ","P1-N4011D2":"emotion, when some bullshit, you know, stupid, institutional hoo-ha. [00:37:07] But maybe I’ve answered my own question.
THERAPIST: (pause) Yeah, but that’s sort of the first thing that sounded plausible to me, like, about Deena, as something you’re having trouble expressing. Does that matter?
CLIENT: I wouldn’t quite say that. [00:38:02] I don’t think I’ve had, in the last half hour, trouble expressing the sadness, but I have had trouble actually feeling it. In other words, I’m aware that I feel it. I’m aware of why I feel it. Intellectually, I have no difficulty, ","P1-N401211":"and I have no difficulty saying that I’m sad, but I don’t feel it right here now, and...
THERAPIST: Yeah, that’s sort of...
CLIENT: ... that’s a little weird.
THERAPIST: ... what I mean.
CLIENT: Yeah, OK.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I agree with all those things you said. I mean, it doesn’t seem to me like you’re not being clear about it or that you’re unaware of it, but there’s some contact with it that’s...
CLIENT: Missing, yeah. Yeah.
THERAPIST: And then, I guess I think of – in a way, as a kind of very direct expression of it, you know, like if somebody cries, that’s expressing sadness. [00:39:04] Do you know what I mean, like – or if you...
CLIENT: But you’ve noticed, it’s often when I feel a strong emotion or at least sometimes when I feel a strong emotion, I will cry, but I still won’t feel it.
THERAPIST: Yeah. You know, anyway, my point was to link that with the difficulty of writing to her. I mean, this is the first thing that seems like it has the kind of emotional heft and the sense of blockage.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But we should stop.
CLIENT: Yeah, OK. OK. So I’ll see you on Thursday.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: OK. I was going to show you the latest picture, but that’s OK. It’s not a very urgent thing. We’ll...
THERAPIST: OK.
CLIENT: ... do it on Thursday. I didn’t walk in with a – I walked in with a book, but not with a jacket.
THERAPIST: I just [don’t know] (ph).
CLIENT: OK. See you later.
THERAPIST: Yeah, take care.
CLIENT: All right. Bye.
