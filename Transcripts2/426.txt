TITLE: Client "K", Session January 31, 2014: Client discusses issues at work and trying to deal with the feeling of helplessness.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses issues at work and trying to deal with the feeling of helplessness.
THERAPIST: [00:00:23] Just to say [ph], for after today, we’re next on for Wednesday?
CLIENT: Right, yeah.
CLIENT: [Mumbles] [inaudible at 00:01:07]
CLIENT: I guess I feel a little bit [pauses] better than yesterday, but I don’t really know why. And [pauses]… [00:02:00]
CLIENT: Um, [pauses for 12 seconds] I just – yesterday, my American [ph] – I don’t know – all the people, like all that different stuff and – I don’t know – maybe I just got kind of distracted from… [00:03:00]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And then he is like, “Oh.” He doesn’t, like, blame me but he is like, “Oh, well, do everything you can to convince the company to process them quickly.”
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: I don’t know. [00:04:00]
CLIENT: Um, [pauses]…
THERAPIST: Well, I think [clears throat]… [00:05:00]
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: I think that, [pauses for five seconds] uh, [pauses for five seconds] there are [clears throat] reasons to think that [clears throat] some of that may be a kind of susceptibility on your part, to feeling like things are your fault. [Pauses for five seconds] I guess what I have in mind is ","P1-N400351":"that, as you said, you describe it to me, it doesn’t sound as though he is particularly blaming you. Clearly, he is frustrated – no question about that...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [00:07:00]
THERAPIST: …And he wants things to be different, but I’m not hearing him say anything specifically directed at you, or explicit about finding fault with you. And you say he does kind of do this to everybody, which I guess makes me think a little bit that he is not sort of singling you out ","P1-N400391":"in some way or necessarily imagining this is a pattern of yours. So [pauses] I get that you very much feel like he is saying it is your fault, that you’re kind of screwing up, and then, in light of how unfair that is, you get really mad. [00:08:06]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. I don’t know. I feel like I just kind of [pauses] – this happens all the time, where – in the last couple of months, he has had all these big projects that we’re doing for companies…
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: …And – yeah, so it is like, “We have a meeting next week. We have to do this,” and that makes me [inaudible at 00:08:50], “Well, I had no idea.”
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And – so I feel like it is literally common [ph] and the thing is – I don’t know – there is no him [ph] [pauses] – working with me or trying to make my life easier to get the data back on time, and so just – it is always kind of like me pushing more.
THERAPIST: The ticking of the clock [ph] [inaudible at 00:09:35]…?
CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:09:38] [Loud taps]
THERAPIST: Very soft [ph]. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: [Chuckles] [Pauses] And [pauses] I don’t know. I guess… [00:10:00]
THERAPIST: I guess the hard part is, in a way, [pauses for seven seconds] – I see the way he is taking no consideration of you and how he is just kind of complaining about the problem and not accounting for how you’re sort of doing your best, then, in effect, he is kind of blaming you for it.
CLIENT: Right. [Pauses] [00:11:00]
THERAPIST: And he is doing it over and over.
CLIENT: [Faintly] Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you got sick of being blamed like that a while ago.
CLIENT: Right. [Pauses] [Sneezes a few times]
THERAPIST: Whoa. I thought we were all [ph] completely over this thing.
CLIENT: [Sneezes again]
CLIENT: I guess I’m just like – in the moment, I’m very mad, kind of.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: I don’t know. [Pauses] I’m feeling just guilty or like I’ve done something wrong, but…
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: There is not much I feel like I can do about it. I just… [00:13:02]
THERAPIST: But, yeah, you feel sort of [pauses for 20 seconds] – I guess it is almost like his apparent thought that you’re to blame or it is your fault, [pauses] in a way, makes it true. And then there is – to one part of you; although, another part of you feels that is really unfair. [00:14:04]
CLIENT: [Faintly] Right.
CLIENT: I don’t know. If – I just kind of want to do things to cause the least amount of problems. Then I feel like – but then I’m always pushed to one side [ph], like to get them out quicker and – but then I worry about doing them so quickly and – and then I realize ","P1-N4007D1":"how [ph] that I’m not doing them fast enough. But the deal [ph] is not going to be there on time, so… [Pauses] [00:15:00]
THERAPIST: [Clears throat]
CLIENT: I don’t know. So I’m always just [therapist blows nose] [inaudible at 00:15:06]…
THERAPIST: I’m sorry. Could you say that one more time? I was blowing my nose. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: I’m sorry.
CLIENT: I’m just kind of like pushing me [ph] to either side, like I have to do it in a way that I’m not – where I worry about how quickly I’m doing it or – or that I’m kind of blamed for not doing it fast enough.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: So [pauses]…
THERAPIST: It is like speed versus quality control?
CLIENT: Right. [Pauses]
THERAPIST: [Clears throat] [Pauses] Well, and, [pauses] again, I think there is this dynamic there where [pauses]… [00:17:00]
CLIENT: I don’t know. [Pauses]
CLIENT: I don’t know. I just – I just kind of feel like [pauses for 11 seconds]…
THERAPIST: And what are the battles [ph]? But go ahead.
CLIENT: Oh, it is just hard for me to…
THERAPIST: Uh-huh?
CLIENT: …I don’t know. The way it is at work – it is just hard for me to kind of, “All right, I’m just going to look at samples,” and then [therapist clears throat] [inaudible at 00:21:05] and one guy is [inaudible at 00:21:06] process them in a while. [00:21:07]
CLIENT: And I – I want to do it well, and I – it is hard to [pauses] do everything and kind of have enough energy or motivation to [pauses]…
THERAPIST: I see. So this sort of contributes to your just feeling pretty overwhelmed.
CLIENT: Right. And how I’m not [pauses] – I don’t know [pauses] – I don’t know. [Pauses for eight seconds] Like, I’m not very good at managing anything. It is like the samples – like people just give me – I get sort of I don’t know what they are, ","P1-N400BD1":"and they have to enter information into the database, and I have to push them to do it; otherwise, I’m cross [ph] and then delete everything.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So it is just like me having to push other people or get what I need, and I feel like it is just kind of [sighs] – I don’t know. A lot of things that I have to remember and think about… [00:24:00]
THERAPIST: Kind of like the things you don’t like to do?
CLIENT: Right. I mean, I’m [inaudible at 00:24:17] to do this. I am saying to the person, “Well, give me a bunch of samples.” I’ll process them all, and then our bosses will be like, “Oh, I sent them five [ph].”
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: And I was like, “Well, I just spent a couple of days…”
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But it is always like – I don’t know – so I get mad at people for not dealing with it, and then they’re always like pushing me because they want their data so they can…
THERAPIST: Uh-huh?
CLIENT: …So they can do their project. But then each – they both [ph] have something to do, so I can’t get to all of them. [00:25:02]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And even – even when my – the two bosses I have are like – just like, “So you [ph] sent them all [ph]?” and I’m like, “No.” [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: So…
THERAPIST: Well, it is pretty difficult to send them all and only half of them at the same time. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Right, and they don’t – they don’t like to talk to each other [inaudible at 00:25:40]…
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: …So it just gets – where it cuts [ph] in the middle and…
THERAPIST: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah, and the other thing that – I hear what you were saying before, which is [pauses] how… [00:26:06]
CLIENT: Right.
CLIENT: I guess I just kind of feel like I need to [pauses] keep my energy or [pauses] like awareness or something that… [00:27:13]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Yeah, that would be a lot easier, if you just – if it is – I know it doesn’t, but if, somehow, it did feel more like, “OK, these people are kind of [chuckles] impossible.”
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Or, “These people in the situation are kind of impossible. They want stuff that is contradictory or that I could never predict their demands, or” – and stuff like that. [00:28:04]
CLIENT: Right. [Pauses for five seconds] I guess I just kind of – when things kind of are done, I just feel guilty because I know I – I could have processed them quicker or, “Oh, I should have gone and talked to that person about pushing them to get the sample to me instead of tomorrow ","P1-N400FF1":"[ph],” or whatever.
THERAPIST: I do wonder if there is a prevalence here where you tend to feel like I am pressuring you or have an expectation for you figuring things out or taking in things I say in a certain way, or understanding exactly what I mean and what to do about it. [00:29:02]
CLIENT: [Faintly] Yeah.
CLIENT: I don’t know. I guess I just get confused and then try to think of a [pauses] – a solution.
THERAPIST: Like, there are times what I say, kind of on the surface, might make sense but it is kind of unclear what to do with it or…
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: …It kind of fits [ph] or something.
CLIENT: Oh.
THERAPIST: And a part of that, I guess, involves a feeling that [pauses] – I guess almost like Bryan, who seems to have this idea that you’re supposed to somehow know when he needs stuff or get it done quicker or something. [00:31:06]
CLIENT: Right. I don’t know. [Pauses] I guess I kind of go to a place where I think if I – [pauses] I don’t know if I can think about this clearly and have energy, and whatever…
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Then if they don’t understand or kind of if there are [ph] words for it.
THERAPIST: I see. I don’t know if this helps but, for my part, I guess I imagine there will be things that I say that are clear and make more sense or feel like they fit better, other things that might make sense but then it is unclear what to do with them, and other things that God only knows ","P1-N401251":"what the hell I’m talking about. [Chuckles] [Pauses] And what I mean, if I don’t feel that [chuckles] way to you – I – and that [pauses] what makes sense and what doesn’t, what seems applicable and what doesn’t [pauses] help me to understand better where you’re ","P1-N401252":"coming from. Obviously, I don’t mean that I’m trying to say anything that doesn’t make sense or isn’t going to help, because that is not true; I am. [00:33:05]
THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean?
CLIENT: Yeah. [Pauses] [Faintly] I guess. I don’t know [ph]. [00:33:56]
THERAPIST: Like, if I say something that I anticipate will make sense or be useful and it doesn’t or isn’t, that makes me think that there must be something about what we’re talking about or where you’re coming from on something that I have sort of not appreciated or not really ","P1-N4012F1":"got so well.
CLIENT: Right. Yeah, I guess it is just like I want to kind of restate it in a way that – kind of – well, that shows it is a kind of – I don’t know – the helplessness of feeling so that – I don’t know – that even – it is kind of like another way ","P1-N401311":"of you addressed that problem directly and not – it is not because… [00:35:03]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [Pauses]
THERAPIST: So there is a way in which you’re kind of getting back to what is troubling you, in what we’re talking about, and expressing your sense of helplessness about how to handle it.
CLIENT: Right.
CLIENT: I don’t know. I guess it is sort of a thing like me being [pauses] – me being negative or kind of [pauses] feelings of being stuck. Like, yeah, like it pricks [ph] [inaudible at 00:38:25] being productive, like kind of being motivated to do things that I know in a rational line [ph] ","P1-N401471":"would make me feel better. And I guess I kind of just want something to [pauses] prevent that from happening or [pauses] a way to kind of [pauses] not.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: I don’t know. It is hard. And there are so many different factors that tend to crack [ph] down, but [pauses] I just – I think I just want like, “Oh, just remember this mantra.” [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: I feel like, yeah, something you can hold onto, that will help you not get so frustrated or feel so overwhelmed, [pauses] kind of like to keep your head above water while you’re trying to deal with all that kind of crap from Bryan or whomever, that you’re talking about at work.
CLIENT: Right.
CLIENT: I guess – yeah, it is just, to me, like I just don’t – I’m trying to find something that I can – that I can do or not do that would make me feel better or [pauses]…
THERAPIST: So I’m not sure there is something as simple as a mantra [pauses] that will help. [00:44:02]
