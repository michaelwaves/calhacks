TITLE: Client "A", Session May 17, 2013: Client discusses the lack of sleep he got before the session and how his anxiety leads to a heightened state of psychological arousal.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the lack of sleep he got before the session and how his anxiety leads to a heightened state of psychological arousal.
THERAPIST: Good morning.
CLIENT: Good Morning. (pause) Um. (clears throat) (pause) (clears throat) Um. (sighs) [00:02:27]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: in murky situations is in the throes of a big speech in Holland. And he basically said, "Listen, we can't talk this through until " And he just kind of gave an update of what's going on, "until this is out the door." Which is okay, but it makes me feel, I mean sort of classically, anxious ","P1-N400171":"about our relationship, anxious about whether there's something going on on that end.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know, and I've just been having to manage it.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Wednesday was very difficult. I ended up just sending a very quick note and, you know, getting this response. [00:05:06]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Thursday So Wednesday was really hard. I was really kind of captured (ph) by it, a kind of new set of skills, I guess, I hope. You know, I managed it within the day. And Thursday I was kind of more or less functioning but not especially well. But you know, I got some stuff done and then Jennie ","P1-N400231":"and I went out to a function where she's a [fellow] this year.
THERAPIST: Who is [Jesse Jackson] (ph)?
CLIENT: [Jesse Jackson] (ph) is a lawyer.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: And he's sort of in Internet culture he's very important.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: But he's a professor at Brown Law School. [00:06:17]
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: And he founded this center on institutional corruption. And we went to this [clearing center] and it was a very embarrassing, sort of through the narrative, it was a very embarrassing event really because, you know, we basically sat down and had this very badly catered dinner. And there were ","P1-N400351":"all of these, you know, kind of typical Brown (inaudible at 00:06:49) around.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Anyway, just sort of a caricature of the way that academics get ahead, I guess. And, you know, I don't know. On the theme of This is as different theme. I will divert ourself. But it's like everything that makes me feel uncomfortable about this environment. You know? It's kind hierarchical, ","P1-N4003B1":"it's, you know, back scratching.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: It's, you know, bourgeois. I mean, you know, like all of the things that make me uncomfortable, to my detriment, about many institutional environments. You know, it sort of expressed, or allows me to express this discomfort. [00:07:49]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: Anyway, so, you know, it was fine and I was fine. (inaudible 00:07:58) (coughs) Even through the evening I was kind of struggling (ph) with it. And (sigh) so Jennie and I were going to talk about the fight and we resolved it fine. I felt okay about it. And our intimacy has really been, not intimacy ","P1-N400431":"in a kind of interactive sense but our sexual intimacy -
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: has really been impaired in the last few months.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And I just feel like kind of disturbed by it. And, you know, she said what I knew already, which is that when I'm very anxious it's hard. Which makes sense but isn't great to hear.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: (pause) (sigh) But it was nice. I mean we had a good moment, a sweet moment. Went to bed and I woke up revved. It's the best way of explaining it I guess. [00:09:04]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: I mean just sort of aroused in a psychological sense, I guess.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: And, you know, like I immediately made the connection to the way that I feel aroused in kind of, you know, a heightened state of focus when I'm feeling anxious. And also, you know, a connection to the way that I'm feeling aroused when I'm working very well. You know? Just this heightened state ","P1-N400571":"of something. This somewhat altered state.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: But the state of arousal felt very similar to me. And, I mean, I guess the point of departure that I imagine for our conversation today -
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: was that. I mean it's all very good. It's potentially, you know, fine and productive. I just can't, I don't have any control over it. (pause) (clears throat) And maybe because I don't have any control over it, it fucks of my sleep, and it fucks up my relationships, and it fucks up my work ","P1-N400611":"process. And yet I'm kind of dependent on it. (pause) [00:11:28]
THERAPIST: Right. (pause)
CLIENT: You know, this is a faculty that I have, you know, for better or worse, for good and for ill, and that facilitates, you know, all of these other different processes and impedes other ones. And I have this sense that, you know, it could be very productive and fulfilling and satisfying. You know? ","P1-N400671":"If only I could kind of control it, but I can't. [00:12:36]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And I guess the thought that I had was, you know, these are such basic functions that when I can't control it it's impeding the The agenda that presents itself most forcefully to me is, you know, "Well, why can't I control it?" And, I guess, I mean in some sense when I say that, you know, ","P1-N4006B1":"I felt very anxious but was able to control it after a relatively short time, that's kind of what I'm talking about.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: Like active fear. You can say that, but it kind of doesn't matter whether you call it anxiety or arousal, at some level. You know, I got it clearly. And over time I've developed strategies for managing it. It seems to be the case that this is the way that I'm This is a kind of tendency that ","P1-N400771":"I'll probably always have.
THERAPIST: (laughs)
CLIENT: I'm not putting words in your mouth. But I think one of the questions we talked about is whether whatever it is that, you know, that I'm feeling that is troubling me or, you know, causing difficulty for me in my life, is something that can be erased or whether it's something that I have to come ","P1-N4007F1":"to terms with and develop strategies for managing. That seems to me to be Assume that for the moment, you can respond. [00:17:28]
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: But if that's true then, you know, we call it Bob, we could call it Jeffrey. I mean we could it arousal. We could call it, you know, something that has a negative association or something that has a positive association.
THERAPIST: And the meaning I'm understanding you to be saying is that we tend to focus on the narrative that embeds the arousal. You know? Why would this situation have gotten you revved up? Or why would that situation have made you anxious? Or, you know, what was the meaning of what was going on that ","P1-N4008B1":"made it really matter to you? But this sort of narrative part.
CLIENT: Nice. I think that's on the nose.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I feel like I I've been saying this periodically.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But particularly on Wednesday. I feel very suspicious right now of these narratives. It just feels like the, you know, the indeterminacy of all hypotheses presents itself to me very forcefully in trying to, you know, come up with a narrative, the narrative that best explains these things. Whether ","P1-N400991":"it's control or hierarchy or God knows. [00:21:35]
THERAPIST: I have some narratives about that. But I'll stop (cross talking at 00:21:50)
CLIENT: I know you do. I know. No, no no.
THERAPIST: I'll spare you at the moment.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But I hear what you're saying.
CLIENT: You hear what I'm saying. I mean, this feels very concrete. And concrete, specific and important. Like this is really important. You know, this is key at some level. You know, whether, however you approach it, whatever the strategy is. And I'm happy to entertain others.
THERAPIST: Well I think -
CLIENT: But I just feel like I want (sigh) I feel an urgency at this moment, on two hours sleep, to address the thing itself or what feels obviously, whatever.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But, you know, what feels (laughs) at this particular moment (inaudible at 00:22:36) itself. And I feel like we often don't. That somehow maybe just the intrinsic aspect of the psychotherapeutic process just leads us always to narrative and so we almost, we ignore this important common thread.
THERAPIST: I think the experience that you're having right now kind of has a "trying to reach me" about the way you get worked up and what it's like. And being worried, I think, that I'm going to, eh, not actually explain it away, but -
CLIENT: I don't care whether you're I mean at some level I don't care whether you explain it away. What I'm saying is that (sigh) (pause) I'm saying it's important and I want attention paid to it. You know, you're welcome to say whatever you want. (laughs) My position will be the same. I don't feel ","P1-N400B31":"worried about it. I just feel rigid (ph) about it. [00:23:44]
THERAPIST: I guess what I mean by explain it away is that it won't reach me. I won't actually pay attention to it. I mean, you know, I said, "Well, and really the thing that matters here is looking is how this comes up, and when it comes, and what the stories are around it. And the experience itself ","P1-N400B51":"is just, oh, that's your temperament or whatever. But let's look at "
CLIENT: But also that it's come to all of the circumstances that we've created narratives about.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: The other ones, I'm not sure. But the presence or absence of this, you know, feeling or whatever, state of mind I guess, it feels like part of the continuum of sleep in some sense. You know? Just this arousal, it feels like it's almost part of, to my detriment -
THERAPIST: You mean, like it's on the other end of the continuum of sleep but it's (cross talking at 00:25:17)
CLIENT: I have no other end of the continuum. It' like similar It's like, you know, you have various states of mind as a human being, some of them conscious some of them not conscious, and it's like a hyperconsciousness.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)
CLIENT: Anyway, so, yeah, I don't know if I feel worried about, I just feel urgent about it. Maybe we're describing the same -
THERAPIST: Aroused, one might say.
CLIENT: Aroused, one might say that. Something. It feels important to me. It feels like a term of reference or a frame of reference that we haven't explored very much and I would like to discuss it. (laughs) I don't feel worried about not discussing it. I feel, again, I mean as I said many times, even ","P1-N400CB1":"when I felt, you know, conflict or frustration -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I feel like we've established good rapport. And that is very, you know, important to me and important to the process. I don't feel worried that you'll be dismissive in some way. But it feels urgent. It feels like an important way of talking about things that we often don't. So, I think that's ","P1-N400CF1":"where I'm at. [00:26:36]
THERAPIST: Is what feels important establishing, sort of, elaborating the description of the state?
CLIENT: Well, I guess, responding to this other frame of reference in some way. You know, like thinking about what it would mean to respond to the state rather than to the narrative about the state, or the narratives that arise in relation to the -
THERAPIST: maintained.
CLIENT: maintained. And so on and so forth. And I often feel, a little bit, I guess And, again, maybe this is well trodden territory but maybe it's not with this level of specificity. I often feel as if, you know, the frame of reference which is proximal to, you know, roads being maintained is something ","P1-N400DF1":"that we avoid. And I wonder what it would mean to, you know, go (inaudible at 00:29:15).
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: But if we wanted to pay attention -
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: to, you know, the structure of roads and the collection of taxes.
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: If we wanted to pay attention to the state of arousal itself rather than the narratives that grow up around it or that contribute to it, what would it mean in this setting? I'm not demanding, you know, a medicine or some other instrumental intervention that would, you know, afford greater control ","P1-N400ED1":"over it. Or a, I don't know, meditation technique or what have you. [00:30:23]
THERAPIST: It seems to me that this is (pause) inherently a combination of talking bureaucracy and talking literature in that, you know, somebody comes into some governmental office and complains because the roads aren't being maintained. And first they talk about what's not happening.
CLIENT: But I guess what I'm saying is that there's a phenomenon here and the phenomenon unites the moments when the bureaucracy is not working and the moments when the bureaucracy is working. It's like, you know, a kind of structural feature of the bureaucracy. You know, I'm noticing something that ","P1-N400F71":"feels important, that's completely non-narrative. It has nothing to do with narrative. But what I'm saying is -
THERAPIST: [Well these thing have] a lot to do with narrative. I'm just saying that there are inherently two different ways we talk about these things. One is, and that's sort of where I was going, is to say that, you know, so then you see what's going on with a bureaucracy. Or fine, you say like, "You ","P1-N400F91":"know, like this town is great at schools and lousy at roads." Or whatever.
CLIENT: I want to be able to adjust it. I want to be able to adjust the "what." And my ability to adjust the what is lacking.
THERAPIST: I think you want to kind of escape the narrative somewhat, to tell you the truth.
CLIENT: I do. I do.
THERAPIST: Yeah. It can't be done.
CLIENT: That's true. That's true. That's true.
THERAPIST: And I understand. I think what you said before about the way you're experience of having these various disjointed ad hoc feeling narratives, I think, spun or thrown at you, you know, in a way where they don't seem to really touch or connect well with, you know, the "what."
CLIENT: Okay. Good. So, no, that helps. Yeah, it feels like it hasn't felt, significantly.
THERAPIST: Right. Yeah. That we come back to this very often.
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess that's it. It's just as simple as that. And yet, you know, I guess, there's some -
THERAPIST: And yet, and yet.
CLIENT: And yet, the other part of my narrative of the last couple of days is that I felt like I managed this one a little bit better.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: (sigh)
THERAPIST: I think both in here and in life that ongoing narrative I'm acknowledging admitting, whatever you do distrust narrative often. Do you know the expression, like the gift is close to the wound? [00:35:39]
CLIENT: No, but I understand it.
THERAPIST: Yeah. It seems like that with you and narrative, in a way. That, like, you're sort of gifted at it in one way but also it feels disconnected and you feel distrustful of it.
CLIENT: I feel betrayed by it and I feel defeated by its inability to get me what I Like, bounded by time.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: In the real world I feel defeated by this ability to get what I want.
THERAPIST: And I think that's more so about your relation to narrative than about the specific -
CLIENT: Well that's very abstract. It's about my relation to, you know, my professional training in understanding and producing narratives that -
THERAPIST: Oh no, I don't think so. I think it started well before that. I mean developmentally you had to notice really early on that we talked about you really feeling very much betrayed by, about [00:36:52]
CLIENT: True.
THERAPIST: I guess I imagine it starts there or is close to starting there. And is (pause) also very much bound up with what happens in a person. If when Jack (ph) says, "Hey, you know, I'm working on this speech and I'm just swamped with it and we're going to have to talk about this." And you're, you ","P1-N4012D1":"know, after I'm done with, after you're outside the door, and I think the next thing you said earlier today was something like, "I don't think there's anything else going on there."
CLIENT: There's certainly another narrative that I have.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: That interposes itself in the -
THERAPIST: Yeah, and you -
CLIENT: The most obvious narrative, which is that -
THERAPIST: Just what he said.
CLIENT: Just what he said. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Yeah. So I completely agree that the way I framed it in terms of narrative is kind of abstract, but I think it has sort of very evident roots or is evidently embedded in what happens interpersonally in the present. And long in your history (inaudible at 00:38:49) cross up here, in how it ","P1-N4013F1":"strikes you and I differently.
CLIENT: Well that's I think what you just said is important and true and has come up in other contexts before. But (pause) I think what's implicit in it is that while I'm very good at narrative, I'm not good at sustaining them.
THERAPIST: Hm.
CLIENT: There's a kind of ephemeral nature -
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: of these narratives in my consciousness. And I find it very easy to lose the thread.
THERAPIST: Mm hm. Yeah.
CLIENT: And that's very important.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: That, you know, memory is not Memory, I guess is one way of describing it and you can use that framework. But, you know, it has, it's some -
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Another way of putting it, I guess, is kind of the persistence or durability of, you know, of the story. [00:41:04]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I find it very easy to lose it.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And the story, you know, conceived in terms of a relationship, conceived in terms of a, you know, work project, conceived in terms of all of these things.
THERAPIST: Yeah. And I think that's probably why you, including today in a way, like you really have a desire for something concrete or instrumental, because it would -
CLIENT: That's true.
THERAPIST: circumvent -
CLIENT: What feels unreliable.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)
CLIENT: You, me and the clock.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) [You've said that a couple of times.] (ph) [00:42:05]
CLIENT: Mm hm. (pause) I mean and, again, I guess -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: The way I understand that, you know, ephemeral quality to, you know, the narratives that I'm able to produce that describe the world around me is as like a structural feature. Which is a little, I mean it's almost contradictory or paradoxical. [00:43:12]
THERAPIST: Mm hm.
CLIENT: But as, you know, like some kind of physical -
THERAPIST: Hm.
CLIENT: neuro-physiological inability to preserve them, to remember them, to call them to mind consistently in moments of need. And, I mean, this sort of running on -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: skit that we have in which you'll say something along the lines of what you just did.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: That, you know, they're all overlapping and converging around reality. And me having a strong sense that they're just du jour.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I guess is, in some ways, a debate about whether this is a structural phenomenon or just a question of orientation. (pause)
THERAPIST: I would say it sort of relates to the trail. [00:44:18]
CLIENT: Relates to the trail. Okay.
THERAPIST: Like a deep distrust -
CLIENT: I see.
THERAPIST: from first (ph).
CLIENT: I see. (sigh) (pause)
THERAPIST: We should stop for now.
CLIENT: Huh. See you next week. (sigh)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
