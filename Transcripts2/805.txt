TITLE: Client "R", Session August 01, 2013: Client discusses her relationship with her therapist and her need for attention and love from all her relationships.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her relationship with her therapist and her need for attention and love from all her relationships.
CLIENT: How's it going?
THERAPIST: Going all right.
THERAPIST: What's on your mind?
CLIENT: So many things. I wonder if you moved that there for me, or if that's where it lives, now?
THERAPIST: I put it there.
CLIENT: Cool. I haven't sat there in a while.
THERAPIST: You're not that predictable, either, (inaudible at 00:00:54).
CLIENT: That's great news. [00:01:00] It's really nice that you put it there; thanks.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: I guess part of me really wants to know which of my positions you prefer...but I guess I believe you said it didn't-no one was better than the other.
THERAPIST: Or I guess worst (ph) get it right than answer.
CLIENT: That's fine. [Laughs]
THERAPIST: I'm trying to use it to motivate me to get cut flowers.
CLIENT: Whoa. Really?
THERAPIST: (Crosstalk at 00:02:38), yeah!
CLIENT: Does anybody comment on the sunflowers?
THERAPIST: Yeah, a couple of [those have] (ph) (inaudible at 00:02:49).
CLIENT: Well, it seems like we're on the same wavelength. [00:03:00]
THERAPIST: I used to have plants in here. I had a bonsai tree that lived over there for a while and I had some orchids before I got the (inaudible at 00:03:10).
CLIENT: I know. I asked you about that.
THERAPIST: You did? [Laughs]
CLIENT: Uh huh. I told you you didn't have any plants in here and you said that you used to; and you used to have a bonsai. Maybe you didn't talk about the orchids and then I suggested that you try an easier plant. Also, orchids are so weird, because when they don't have flowers, they're sort of bad-looking. ","P1-N4003D1":"They're very heady plants. [00:04:00] You're a heady guy, I think.
CLIENT: I also think you're a total mush.
THERAPIST: [Laughs] How do you mean?
CLIENT: I think it's not that hard to...make you turn into a puddle of love. [00:05:08] Your daughters have the best access to that, but I see it here, with me. And I see it here without meeting (ph). So those aren't mutually exclusive, at all.
THERAPIST: Well, I certainly hope you're right.
CLIENT: That's an annoying response.
THERAPIST: Really?
CLIENT: Yeah!
THERAPIST: [Laughs] (Crosstalk at 00:05:43) annoyed.
CLIENT: "I certainly hope you're right"?
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, like I aspire to that.
CLIENT: Oh! Cool.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I misunderstood.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:06:00]
CLIENT: I find myself counting down the hours to coming here to coming here, period.
CLIENT: I guess I don't really have much else to say about that, but it feels important.
CLIENT: I think I count down the hours to other things, too, but not so much, these days. It reminds me of the groups of five checkmarks that I made-it was like 100. [00:08:00] Ninety were left when I started seeing my cousins in Virginia again-I mean, in Kentucky again.
CLIENT: It occurs to me how alone I was-that day, in those moments. I have such a vivid memory of it. I don't know, I was eight, or something-or nine. We had just come back from a week at the beach.
CLIENT: Jeremy thinks that I loved my parents and my family life so much that I didn't notice the bad things-not that they were there and they were not welcome at home. But, obviously, this pain-there's no space for it. I guess I didn't notice that that was something that could have been there at that-when ","P1-N4007D1":"I was young. [00:12:00] Does that make sense?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't think so, either. I do think that's a rude awakening. [00:13:00]
THERAPIST: I mean, you couldn't say something like that unless it's true.
CLIENT: Hmm. Yeah, you couldn't. Well, it's sort of typical of him. He's pretty self...self-critical.
THERAPIST: [Isn't he] (ph) self-deprecating?
CLIENT: Self-deprecating, which is paired with a very strong...perfectionism and-I mean, all of it, I think, comes from a very strong fear of fear. [00:14:02] Fear of-who knows? A lot of fear, but sometimes it comes out in a self-deprecating. And often, it comes out in a..."I'm right, you're wrong."
CLIENT: Or the way you don't-the way you should remember not to put a certain peeler on the end-grain walnut cutting board because it leaves a black-it reacts and leaves a black, chemical residue. These are things that I do often.
CLIENT: Three kinds of towels, by the way: kitchen towels; bathroom, hand towel; and bathing towel. The towels are a central character.
THERAPIST: I guess so.
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Causes him a lot of stress.
CLIENT: I don't think we should have an affair, but I really want to.
CLIENT: I'm ready to move on from that thought.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Do you have anything to say? My mom has this theory about her sister, who got married at 18 and whose husband is a VP. She didn't really have a career. She didn't have a career.
THERAPIST: She (ph) husband is a VP at-
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: -she's not.
CLIENT: She's not the VP. My uncle is the VP. My mom's sister is-was a chemical engineer, everybody's (ph) an engineer. But then she didn't-
THERAPIST: [Is that wiped out] (ph)?
CLIENT: You're clearly not Tiger (ph) dad. There's a [Tiger hustle] (ph) that we do, but not the one that...is so common (inaudible at 00:22:29), where the only good jobs are quantitative. If you have to, you could be a lawyer; [if you're] (ph) the last rung on my acceptable ladder.
THERAPIST: I have heard that. I didn't know if you were referring to that or (inaudible at 00:22:54).
CLIENT: Sorry, I was so...me. [Chuckles] [00:23:04]
THERAPIST: Sorry, it just occurs to me because partly the shifting of time and partly the length of our meeting I should take one minute-there's a small chance that I got an emergency message.
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: And I'd have to do very little, but I should just make sure that I do not. And I can arrange for not having to do that in the future, but...
THERAPIST: Okay. All set; I'm sorry.
CLIENT: Did you?
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: Do you sometimes get emergency messages around now?
THERAPIST: Yeah. I...yeah.
CLIENT: That sounds stressful.
THERAPIST: I usually check between...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: You can't focus on anything else. [00:27:00]
CLIENT: Maybe my breathing.
THERAPIST: I think you're worried about my, what is it? Stress level or being distracted?
CLIENT: I don't care about your being distracted; I worry about the people involved and what it's like to have, to send an emergency and what it's like to have to receive one on a regular basis. [00:28:04] And how that affects you.
CLIENT: I guess there's a part of it that has to do with feeling excluded again.
CLIENT: I guess I have sea of questions, like, "Is it kids?" "Is it parents?" "Is it a patient?"
CLIENT: How stressful is your life? [00:31:00]
CLIENT: That ocean light (inaudible at 00:31:58) machine is (inaudible at 00:31:59).
CLIENT: Well, I guess I worry about things interjecting, but...
CLIENT: ...not super much. [00:33:00]
CLIENT: Maybe it's such an important thing that I've taken up that it feels irresponsible or disrespectful or something for him not to also be taking it up. [00:34:11]
CLIENT: I guess I feel like maybe I'm wasting your time, if you have really serious things to deal with. [00:35:09]
CLIENT: And that's very sad.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess, in a way, that...makes you feel...how bad you described the feeling in your relation to your parents, that you (inaudible at 00:38:04). This isn't exactly what you said, but I think that it's, in one way, similar.
CLIENT: Hmm.
THERAPIST: -you felt in relation to your family. [00:39:00]
CLIENT: I laugh a lot more when I'm with them and I'm lighter; I'm sort of giddy. And I'm that way at home; not that angry (ph) (inaudible at 00:40:15), not every day. I was like that after our session last week. I was so giddy; I couldn't float down to the ground for hours. It was a lovely feeling. [00:41:00]
CLIENT: My parents didn't approve of having boyfriends and girlfriends. [00:45:00] Because I think about the biggest cause of...badness or something, or the biggest, obvious source of badness, that feels really big.
CLIENT: I had his picture. I got his picture, somehow. And I put it on my bulletin board. I would...say goodnight to him and cry, sometimes, because I missed him so much. [00:49:00] He was the most popular kid in the class and...four years later, I was-did date the most popular kid in the class, and ","P1-N401611":"it was so much of a realization of what I had wanted in fourth grade.
CLIENT: They weren't really scary strict about it; they were never scary strict about anything. But it was highly discouraged. It was sort of like, "Why don't you focus on something better?" Or like, "Why don't you do this in moderation? Hang out with this guy in moderation."
CLIENT: Do you know if there's something about this that does feel illicit?
THERAPIST: You know what it is?
CLIENT: Yeah contact. And the way I feel about it. And how little I share, would share with anybody else. [00:54:02] Guess I feel like some of that applies to you, but I don't know if it's for the same reasons.
CLIENT: On one hand, it's lovely if you share me with your wife. It's very lovely. I think it would be a very hard life to not be able to share...moving things about your work. [0:55:12] So...yeah, but then on the other hand, it would be lovely if you didn't, too. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: I feel like saying, "Your turn!"
THERAPIST: [Laughs]
CLIENT: [Laughs]
THERAPIST: I guess I feel that particular "Your turn!" may be partly about sort of taking the spotlight off-
CLIENT: Hmm.
THERAPIST: -of you. [00:58:05]
CLIENT: I think it feels like I've said a lot and it's hard and it's...I feel like I would need a break or I want a break; and some of that, I think, comes from the heat of it.
CLIENT: Or maybe if I were to talk more, I think I would move to something that felt much less charged or intense, and I think I sensed that and I didn't want that to happen. [00:59:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah, it feels like...mentioning what you do to me was charged.
CLIENT: Uh huh. Yeah. It's kind of embarrassing, though; and in a way that some of the other stuff isn't, because I don't know what I do to you. And you do...so I do not have a lot of room to explore, there. [01:00:00] I think that's not true.
THERAPIST: [Do we] (ph)?
CLIENT: There's plenty of room to explore, there.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: [Chuckles] I guess, I mean I'd rather have you just tell me.
CLIENT: Well, I think this is hard for you and I think you like the attention. [01:01:00] I can't imagine that you get much...I can't imagine that you get much attention at home. I mean, I can't imagine that any father gets much attention, but maybe also because of the way you are. I don't know what ","P1-N401B11":"it will be like if we had kids, but there are tons of days...where I'm pissed because Jeremy isn't giving me enough attention. And I'm asking for it. And he never does that. Even if he wants attention, it's so subdued and slinky and ends up not being over very fast to...ends up being a very slow process ","P1-N401B12":"of getting attention. [01:02:14] So anyway, I imagine that you're probably on that part of the spectrum, as opposed to my part of the spectrum.
THERAPIST: [I have] (ph) that quality with him-I mean, not you, but I'm not sure quite what you mean about.
CLIENT: He doesn't...
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 01:02:38) want it, or if he does, it's (crosstalk at 01:02:40).
CLIENT: When he wants it, it...
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 01:02:42) and low-key and (crosstalk at 01:02:43).
CLIENT: Yeah. When he wants it, it's not...a strong request with conviction. It's not-
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: -obnoxious.
THERAPIST: [Laughs]
CLIENT: [Laughs] So. [01:03:01] One nice thing about being obnoxious is that you get attention, because the person wants you to stop being obnoxious. I try not to be obnoxious, though, because it's much better if the person-Jeremy comes to me because I'm so irresistibly lovable and fun which happens.
CLIENT: So we have challenge and attention. [01:04:00] And love, I think.
CLIENT: I know there's love here.
CLIENT: But that feels like the farthest from the list and that feels exactly right. But it's hard to bear; it's hard to locate or it's hard to talk about elsewhere. [01:05:00] A lot of the times, I feel by myself with it.
CLIENT: Dinner.
THERAPIST: I think...
THERAPIST: I think, in some ways, you are like the you that you are describing being like; and in some ways, you're more like how you're describing Jeremy.
CLIENT: Hmm.
THERAPIST: Around attention. I think you're more like Jeremy when it comes to things like being sad or confused or...lost. [01:10:01] And...you know, whether it's being up in your room as a kid, by yourself, not even having the thought of going and talking to somebody your parents about it.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: Or feeling so intensely for these people that you fell in love with, growing up.
CLIENT: What would have been the way to shine a light on that or bring attention to myself? Like talking to my parents, you mean? [01:11:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah, it's one possibility. I mean...
THERAPIST: God, I guess, clearly, it sort of doesn't occur to you even now how you could have sought-
CLIENT: It doesn't.
THERAPIST: -attention for that. I imagine there were other things, in relation to which you could tell me 15 different ways you could have got attention from them.
CLIENT: I see. That's interesting. No, I can't really think of anything that would have felt right; that would have felt okay or comfortable.
THERAPIST: I don't know. [01:12:00]
CLIENT: Friends, but I didn't-that part wasn't there quite yet. I was just that young.
CLIENT: I actually remember in seventh grade, I had a similar lust over Derek Jeter, (inaudible at 01:12:47). And that was kind of a communal lust; it was so obvious that a few other girls in that grade had it, too; so it didn't feel quite so lonely and bad. [01:13:00]
THERAPIST: Sorry. Your 13-year-old comes to you and, "Hey, by the way? What do you when you're really obsessed with something?" [Chuckles]
CLIENT: [Laughs]
THERAPIST: [Laughs] You say, "Oh, well, I think this is what you do." "Okay, there you go."
CLIENT: [Laughs]
THERAPIST: [Laughs] Come on. You say, "Yes?" and either, "What is it?" or, "Who is it?"
CLIENT: Oh. No.
THERAPIST: [Laughs]
CLIENT: [Laughs] Thank you very much; don't ask, don't tell.
THERAPIST: Apparently.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it was years and years of, "Don't ask, don't tell," so why were you to say who was it or what was it, then?
THERAPIST: It's one thing to discourage your 16-year-old from dating, or your 17-year-old. It's another thing to wonder who your 10-year-old or your 13-year-old has some huge crush on. I mean, it's not like you guys-maybe I'm wrong and at 10 or at 13, we're having heavy dating-
CLIENT: Yeah, I think they were so na�ve-
THERAPIST: I don't mean that's not emotionally-I don't mean that's not emotionally intense. Of course it is. But as parents, discouraging dating is not the same as wanting to know what's going on with your-
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: -kid. Again, it's one thing, sort of discouraging your 16-year-old or 17-year-old who's got a date; or even your 15-year-old. [01:16:06] But your middle schooler or your elementary schooler-
CLIENT: Hmm. I think-
THERAPIST: -it's not like-
CLIENT: -your cut-off should be 13.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Blowjobs came on the scene, then.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Sex came on the scene, then.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: But, sure: ten and then-I think they were na�ve. I don't think they knew me; I don't think they knew that side of me. They didn't know how I was calibrated and what exactly I was doing or what I wanted to do. And I think they were also really uncomfortable, themselves. So they didn't ","P1-N402451":"want to talk about it.
THERAPIST: So you think they knew when you asked about being obsessed, that it was with someone?
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. I think-
THERAPIST: As opposed to frogs.
CLIENT: Yeah. I think they knew me better than that.
THERAPIST: (Crosstalk at 01:18:35)
CLIENT: Yeah. Jeremy may be frogs or black flies (ph) comes to mind.
THERAPIST: (Crosstalk at 01:18:46)
CLIENT: No, I think they knew me pretty well pretty early on.
THERAPIST: Okay. So they knew you well enough to know it was-but you...
THERAPIST: ...you did just say they didn't really know this side of you. [01:19:05] And (crosstalk at 01:19:06).
CLIENT: I don't think they knew how...how it manifested in my mind, moment to moment. Kind of like when I told my mom-actually, when I called you in December, it was right after talking to her.
THERAPIST: It doesn't really hang together very well for me about how they were with you around this (ph). I mean...
CLIENT: Can you explain more? What doesn't fit with what? [01:22:00]
CLIENT: Right, so I had about 28 pictures of Derek Jeter in my room. Somehow, no one's door is closed or you-we-this wasn't a house where anyone closed doors; so my parents were in my room a lot. And David Novak's (sp?) fourth-grade picture was on my bulletin board, too. So in some sense, there was ","P1-N4027D1":"a quiet acknowledgment but never...never really anything deeper. [01:24:04]
THERAPIST: I think it's probably in the moment here, between you and me, important to you to feel like you and I are on the same page about this; and see how they were in a similar way or that, yeah, that we see (inaudible at 01:25:47). And I think...
THERAPIST: ...the prospect that I see how they were with you quite differently than you do; that you and I have pretty different views of it, perhaps. It's frustrating and kind of upsetting.
CLIENT: You're choosing to focus on that?
THERAPIST: You mean, as opposed to the stuff between you and them?
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Okay. I think you're totally right and I think I want to know what you think as clearly as possible so that I can incorporate it into my world view. [01:27:10] It's an easier way to do it. And so that I can have it as part of...
CLIENT: ...you know, part of what's hard about...spending a lot of time on my parents is that they're alive and I talk to them all the time. And it's pretty hard for me to not spill my beans all day, every day. [01:28:03] In one sense; clearly, we're talking about a sense in which I manage to do that ","P1-N402991":"for my whole life.
THERAPIST: I think you want to-you want to be on the same page with me. And you want to be on the same page with them.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You want to hear, clearly, what I think so that you can evaluate it and take the parts of that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You can be clear about it with them so they can be on the same page with them (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah, I think the important thing here is that I'm not really making room or allowing for a discovery discussion with them...in this. [01:30:06]
THERAPIST: I think that's up with me (ph) around some of that-this stuff that we're talking about, too.
CLIENT: Allowing a discovery discussion?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I think it has to do with-okay. I don't know which one comes first, but I think it has to do with wanting to be clear about it with them. So I need to be clear about it here, even though it means not actually allowing for what really is to come up.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I think the-more about managing anxiety than about...per se wanting to really know what you think about it. [01:31:03]
CLIENT: I think it's managing anxiety around doing something with it, real quick.
THERAPIST: Which I think is also about managing anxiety about feeling like there's not a disconnect or a gash-
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: -for (ph) this agreement.
CLIENT: Yeah. It's very hard to hold on to it. It's hard to hold on to unresolved...stuff about that (ph).
THERAPIST: I'll see you Monday and Tuesday next week. [01:32:01]
CLIENT: Yeah (ph).
THERAPIST: [You mean just] (ph) now?
CLIENT: No, I'm fine (ph). On Tuesday.
THERAPIST: Oh. Okay.
CLIENT: Bye. [Chuckles]
