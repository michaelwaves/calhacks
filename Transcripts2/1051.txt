DESCRIPTION: Client has extreme memory loss, probably associated with her ECT treatments. Therapist tries to learn the extent of her memory loss by asking questions about her most recent activities as well as going back a decade.
CLIENT: Hi.
THERAPIST: Is that okay?
CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) Is that okay?
THERAPIST: Yeah. In what sense?
CLIENT: I don't know.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess it was helpful for me too because it sounds like James is seeing similar things to what I'm seeing and also to how it seems to you that he's not seeing additional things isn't good I think. [00:01:13]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And to know that (inaudible at 00:01:25) certainly makes sense to me as well is that this seems related to the increase in frequency and dose intensity from last week.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And also to know that you guys are seeing Dr. Vaughn tomorrow so I'll leave her a message today.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And that the ECT after (inaudible at 00:02:01) Friday could she keep in contact with me. [00:02:06]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:02:10).
CLIENT: Yeah. Okay.
THERAPIST: I have a scheduling question for Friday. So I'm good tomorrow at our usual time if that works for you.
CLIENT: I'm thinking. I think that works for me.
THERAPIST: Okay. Let me know later today if it doesn't.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And then Friday I had scheduled something else because one you were in the hospital last week I had assumed we wouldn't be talking on Friday. I have, as it turns out, two other times I could talk on Friday either at 11:10 in the morning or at 4:30 in the afternoon. Would either one of those work? [00:03:15]
CLIENT: I think one of them will work, but I don't know.
THERAPIST: Okay. Do you remember when your ECT appointment is?
CLIENT: Um, No. I have ECT at 7:45.
THERAPIST: In the morning?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So...
THERAPIST: So either one of those would work? [00:04:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. You'd be back on time. Do you want to do 11:10?
CLIENT: Okay. (Pause)
THERAPIST: I guess just let me know if the time tomorrow isn't good.
CLIENT: Okay. (Pause) Sorry. Which time tomorrow? [00:05:15]
THERAPIST: 12:55.
CLIENT: 12:55. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Not much that's on your mind? [00:07:19]
CLIENT: Not really, no. (Pause)
THERAPIST: How was last night?
CLIENT: Last night? What happened last night? It's gone. [00:08:08]
THERAPIST: (Pause) Did you read? Did you and James have a conversation?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: It's just gone.
CLIENT: It's just gone. Yeah. (Pause) I mean presumably we did something. Right? Yeah. [00:09:23]
THERAPIST: How are you feeling?
CLIENT: Good. Yeah. (Pause)
THERAPIST: How so like in good mood, relaxed, sort of happy, peace and... [00:10:14]
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I kind of don't... (Pause) Yeah, I don't know. [00:11:05]
THERAPIST: Do you feel relaxed?
CLIENT: Not very. I don't know.
THERAPIST: Do you feel happy?
CLIENT: (Pause)
THERAPIST: It's hard to think? [00:12:37]
CLIENT: Yeah. Sorry.
THERAPIST: Do you feel like there are things you want to do today?
CLIENT: Things I want to do?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um (Pause)
THERAPIST: Not particularly? [00:13:34]
CLIENT: Not really.
THERAPIST: Going for a walk or... (inaudible at 00:13:48).
CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Do you remember (inaudible at 00:14:12)?
CLIENT: No. [00:14:13]
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: No, I didn't actually.
THERAPIST: Do you remember going to church over the weekend?
CLIENT: Vaguely. Yes.
THERAPIST: Did you go to the service you usually go to?
CLIENT: Yes. It was a different service than we usually go to so it was different.
THERAPIST: Like the time was different? Like you went to the evening one instead of the morning one or what do you mean?
CLIENT: We went to the same service that we usually go to but things were different. [00:15:05]
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: It's not very specific.
THERAPIST: Was it a different priest?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: What like some occasion?
CLIENT: It was some occasion. Yeah. There was more for the priest to do.
THERAPIST: Did you like it?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:16:05]
THERAPIST: (Pause) (inaudible at 00:16:10) what that means. I don't know if it was meaningful or familiar that helped it stick a little better that's helping you remember it and that made it clear that you liked it.
CLIENT: Sounds like a possibility. Yeah. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Has there been anything else like that in the last week or so?
CLIENT: (Pause) No, not really. (Pause)
THERAPIST: And how's your memory for less recent events like visiting with your family over Christmas or... [00:17:23]
CLIENT: Not great. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Do you remember being there at all if not the specific?
CLIENT: Not really. (Pause)
THERAPIST: What if it were longer ago like from high school? [00:18:22]
CLIENT: Huh?
THERAPIST: Do you remember any things from longer ago like high school? (inaudible at 00:18:34).
CLIENT: Not really, no.
THERAPIST: Graduating?
CLIENT: No. (Pause)
THERAPIST: How do you feel as we're talking? [00:19:02]
CLIENT: A little anxious.
THERAPIST: Do you know what's making you anxious? My hunch is sort of this feeling that something is different, something's wrong like processes of your memory. In other words it's kind of disconcerting not to be able to remember all these things.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And I'm asking you a lot about it otherwise you probably wouldn't be thinking about it so much. So sort of focusing on something you're having trouble with like this is disconcerting, and I can imagine it's making you anxious. Does that seem reasonable? [00:20:03]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah? (Pause) I imagine it may show up like being at home where things are a bit more familiar where you're doing stuff, there's stuff to do; reading, or putting meals together, or talking with James about things. That sort of structure is probably helpful now whereas coming in here what ","P1-N400D51":"you talk about is quite open ended and it's a lot about remembering things sort of foregrounds what you're having trouble with. I don't think it's a bad thing. It doesn't sound like it's usually disturbing from what I gather, but I imagine this was making you feel a little more anxious at the moment. [00:21:39]
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: Yes. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Do you have any questions?
CLIENT: No. (Pause) I probably ought to. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Do you have any feeling about coming here now like you want to, or don't, or sort of whatever like how most things are? [00:22:30]
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:22:34). Yeah. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Do you know if you've had any particular ups or downs over the last few days? My impression is probably not, but have you had periods where you felt really bad or really good? [00:23:19]
CLIENT: No, not in particular.
THERAPIST: It's been pretty even?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And like this?
CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause)
THERAPIST: And you still feel like you can read?
CLIENT: I'm sorry?
THERAPIST: You still feel like you can read?
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Good. I believe you can. I'm not saying that like (inaudible at 00:24:02). I mean more like sometimes when people when cognitive function is effected it can get difficult to read like to concentrate and sort of stay with what you're reading. But I'm very glad that that's not happening to you. [00:24:19]
CLIENT: Yeah. Me too.
THERAPIST: Good. (Pause) Do you know when the last time you saw Dr. Vaughn was? [00:25:21]
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Whether it was in the last week or two or longer?
CLIENT: It was longer.
THERAPIST: Longer.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Was it before this state of recent consultation?
CLIENT: I think so. Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. It's been a while.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That's actually good for me to know because when I leave her a message I'll... Does she know you were in the hospital?
CLIENT: Yeah. I think so.
THERAPIST: All right. Well I will put myself (inaudible at 00:26:06) about the ECT and what's happening to you now. [00:26:11]
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: (Pause) I'm not sure what to say. [00:27:21]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: (Pause) It's good you're feeling better.
CLIENT: Yeah. I'm feeling a lot better.
THERAPIST: Good. It's been a long time.
CLIENT: Yes. It really has.
THERAPIST: I imagine it's pretty nice not to be thinking about killing yourself all the time.
CLIENT: Yeah it is nice. I can see that. Yeah. [00:28:23]
THERAPIST: (Pause) I imagine it's like (pause) you just don't feel the same kind of pain you've been feeling.
CLIENT: No. It's good.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Good.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I imagine you now also don't feel like you have to be working so hard all the time.
CLIENT: Yeah. That's nice.
THERAPIST: It's nice to have a break or a big relief.
CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Are there other positive things that stand out? [00:29:35]
CLIENT: (Pause)
THERAPIST: Do you feel like at all optimistic? Your feeling has been like this could never possibly be any better. And I don't get the sense as you're talking that you feel like this is going to go away any second. [00:30:22]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Well we should stop, but I'm really glad that you are feeling better.
CLIENT: Thanks. Yeah.
THERAPIST: I'll see you tomorrow morning.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:30:44]
