TITLE: Client "Ma", Session March 04, 2014: Client discusses not appearing sick to other Clients and friends.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses not appearing sick to other Clients and friends.
CLIENT: But I feel like the best way to deal with it is just not to speculate about how long (inaudible at 00:00:12) (pause)
THERAPIST: Good morning.
CLIENT: Good morning. This (morning) (ph) it doesn’t actually seem like it’s been [that long to me] (ph). Yeah, yeah. I feel like April is when it starts to get old. (pause) [00:01:05] So I was thinking on the way over here, the nice thing about not being in the hospital, it’s not ","P1-N4000F1":"like I don’t just talk to so many people. (chuckle)
THERAPIST: You said that people kind of take care of you often feels (pause) (antantalizing) (ph). (pause)
CLIENT: I guess so. But like I still want them to take care of me. (pause) You know, I do feel younger, but then at the same time, there’s always a part of my brain that’s sort of standing back and evaluating. And that often feels much older. (pause) [00:05:51]
THERAPIST: Oh my gosh.
CLIENT: Yeah, and he was like, “Sometimes it’s like a couple of months.” And in the moment, I was like, “I’m a year ahead of you dude.” (laughter) “Trust me when I say nope.” And so I was like that was fine, then I went away. Then the next day, I was like, ","P1-N400271":"“You know when you said that? That was super patronizing. Don’t do that.” He apologized, and he said, “Oh I didn’t hear the part where you, you know, had tried the inaudible at 00:07:50), I just heard that you were trying them and had given up.
THERAPIST: I guess that in part was like (pause) (coughing) I mean there’re a few different ways, like the limits of your having to take care of him.
CLIENT: Yeah; yeah. It felt like he sort of (pause) you know, he was talking to me early on in like the first couple of days, and found out that I was in the PT program and married to a chemist. And it felt like he was like you’re the -
THERAPIST: Talking about what program?
CLIENT: That I was in the PT program.
THERAPIST: Oh yeah, okay.
CLIENT: That I have this like intellectual background.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I’m not – (sigh) this might be reading too much into it, but it sort of felt like he was like, “Okay, here’s the smartest patient here. I’m going to make her convinced that I’m smarter than she is.” Because they’ve sort of had a lot of – ","P1-N4003B1":"he’d be like, “My dad’s an astrophysicist.” And we’ll talk about physicists when we’re talking about scientists. He’d be like, “Oh, this is what research is like, you know, you sometimes work ‘til two and three in the morning.” [00:09:34]
THERAPIST: He also did a shitty job taking care of you.
CLIENT: Yeah; yeah. I never was like – he was never assigned to be like my one-on-one contact person, which is a good job – a good thing. He mentioned a couple of times about how he’d like to give homework during check-ins. (chuckle) And I’m like, “Yeah, that’s not ","P1-N400431":"happening.” [00:10:38] (laughter)
THERAPIST: All right. (pause) I expect you did it like heard what you’re saying is that they weren’t me.
CLIENT: Yeah, a little bit. (pause) [00:15:00] (pause)
THERAPIST: And (pause) among other things, you were kind of annoyed at them for that. (pause)
CLIENT: Basically. (laughter) (pause) Yeah. (pause) That makes me very uncomfortable, like (pause) it just doesn’t seem to be a safe position to be in. [00:16:31] (pause) I talked with James yesterday about (pause) needing him not to try to manage my care. (pause) And it was a very scary and intense ","P1-N400571":"conversation, but it sort of ended up in a good place.
THERAPIST: Oh. [00:17:41] (pause)
CLIENT: He is I think, taking my ending up in the hospital as a reason that I cannot be trusting, which we’re going to have to talk about. (pause) Yeah. (pause) But that’s not a conversation that I want – like that’s a conversation we’ll have to wait until (inaudible at 00:18:34).
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: (sigh) (pause) I was just thinking about (pause) in terms of trust, like there’s one time in the hospital that I did like self-injure, or I just like scratched my arm up. (pause) And, you know, I told somebody about it. Like in a sort of time that I was supposed to check-in with somebody. ","P1-N4005F1":"[00:19:27] (pause)
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)
CLIENT: It was nice when that actually paid off.
THERAPIST: Yep. (pause) As if it’s I gather both of you in the hospital and when I saw James yesterday?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Eventually.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)
THERAPIST: Yeah I can imagine it feels like some really kind of far out in a way. (pause) Like that’s how it feels. (pause)
CLIENT: It feels like – well it sort of depends, and with James it’s like always worth it to – it’s harder to be with James and not have something correct, like not have the correction be made, because I have to still be around him. And so then there’s just like this terror ","P1-N400771":"that I won’t be able to make him understand that like – or he’ll just be – or it’ll just like be fractured always. (pause) And also I just worry that he’ll be angry at me. [00:22:59]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I was also wondering that. (pause) It wasn’t clear me either. (pause) [00:27:06] (pause)
CLIENT: Apparently I’m super healthy physically, so there’s that. My pulse is like 51.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: Yeah I know. (laughter) Wish I could take any credit for it. (laughter) (pause)
THERAPIST: You know, because something is going on there with your (pause) anxiety about saying you missed me. (pause) You know, that doesn’t seem to (pause) like be followed by remembering I (inaudible at 00:28:27) with James yesterday, and then went back in the hospital, who sort of like stopped ","P1-N400851":"and reconsidered. (pause) Yeah, I’m not sure what it is, like (pause)
CLIENT: He more like – actually that sort of came up at the beginning of the conversation, and then we’re like, “You know, we’re going to let that one go, and then sort of move on to everything else.”
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And so – yeah. (pause)
THERAPIST: Do you have any idea, if this issue was like (pause) feeling a little more hopeful about putting yourself in other peoples’ hands?
CLIENT: Mm. (pause) Yeah. It made me feel like (pause) my life is like this act that I can feel like I can trust you now, if it’s not an act. It doesn’t just happen. (pause) Maybe – (pause) you know, I (pause) I was sitting there talking to some about like sort of wanting to like ","P1-N400911":"ask for support from like Patrick, but for some (inaudible at 00:30:52) not feeling like I could.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)
THERAPIST: Like you said, you were telling about how you didn’t really mind (inaudible at 00:33:49) asking you questions.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [00:34:02] (pause)
THERAPIST: Usually [characterizers are nosey] (ph), but then actually and like (pause) saying positive about her like that you didn’t like that or something like that. (pause)
CLIENT: Yeah, there’s something weird there, like (pause) every time people tell me that like they would not have known that I was going through such a hard time, I’m like – it’s like part of my brain reads that as a bad thing. But like it makes me feel good. [00:35:00] (pause) ","P1-N400A31":"I don’t know what do about that. (pause) [00:36:03]
THERAPIST: Seems like there’s something that also (pause) gets a little competitive or comparative about it.
CLIENT: Mm. (pause)
THERAPIST: Maybe something (background noise) maybe also there’s a kind of satisfaction you take in it that I can’t tell either to do with (pause) feeling like (pause) in control, like the other person is dead, or you (pause) likes makes you feel a little more kind of grown up and in ","P1-N400AB1":"charge, while they’re – maybe that’s it, while they’re kind of in the dark. Or -
CLIENT: Do you know the thing that I’m thinking of is like, probably like makeup that really works. (pause)
THERAPIST: I see. [00:38:07]
CLIENT: (chuckle) Or like it makes me feel the same way. (pause) I guess I feel like it is competitive, but not with the person who’s asking or with like other people who are sad.
THERAPIST: Who can’t -
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [00:39:00] (pause) Yeah like right now I can sort of see that that’s a dead end road. (pause) But like, (sigh) (pause) by trying to admit that that’s shutting myself off from what I actually want, or like the support that I want. But (pause) I don’t know that ","P1-N400B51":"I can see it well enough to actually like want to continue. (pause) [00:40:00] (pause)
THERAPIST: He’s convinced I’m critical about anything.
CLIENT: Yeah, he really don’t like it.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)
CLIENT: I really don’t like feeling like I’m (sigh) (pause) comparing myself to other people who are in pain, and putting myself (with them) (ph). That doesn’t feel good. (pause)
THERAPIST: It’s like you’re kicking them when they’re down kind of?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Also like not even – like I’m not actually superior in any way; it not – (chuckle) my strategy does not work better. (laughter)
THERAPIST: I see. (pause)
CLIENT: And I just like, I get stuck in it, and then (pause) yeah. (pause) I get mistaken for (inaudible at 00:41:50). (pause) I don’t want be that part. (pause) [00:42:50] (pause)
THERAPIST: I guess I’m wondering about like whether there’s an effort to this to do with you (pause) different from how you were today, like (pause) yet other times like keep from me positive things. [00:43:59] (pause)
CLIENT: How do you mean?
THERAPIST: Well, when you said you really missed me, and I – (pause) and that made you anxious, and I can imagine there might have been other times you -
CLIENT: Oh yeah, no, definitely. And that’s (chuckle) that’s what you meant by positive things. Okay. (laughter)
THERAPIST: I never thought of it like that. Right. (laughter) As opposed to catastrophic, horrible, awful things. (laughter) (overlapping voices)
CLIENT: Maybe a little bit. (laughter)
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: (laughter) I really didn’t know what you were talking about. (laughter)
THERAPIST: Right, okay. (pause)
CLIENT: (laughter) (pause) I don’t know what to say about that.
THERAPIST: Okay, we should stop anyway.
CLIENT: Yeah.
