DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the anger and abandonment she feels after a recent breakup. Client is angry that she keeps dating men that aren't good for her and it blows up in her face.
CLIENT: So I went back to work today for the first day since whatever, the twentieth. So, but I was feeling pretty ready to go back to work because I just got kind of bored and like cabin fever with this snow, storms, and stuff. And I have a really, really busy month because between Martin Luther King ","P1-N4000C1":"day and then going away at the end of the month for my birthday, I’m only in the office seventeen days, which is really not a lot. And I have a lot to do in terms of like (inaudible at 00:00:48) is leaving on the thirty-first of this month, and I’m gone starting on the thirtieth, so I won’t ","P1-N4000C2":"even be here on her last day. But I just, I had a lot to do so I was kind of feeling like this is good, like maybe the month will fly by, and you know, whatever. [00:01:02]
THERAPIST: What were you doing (inaudible at 00:08:40) what he’s saying about feeling at fault.
CLIENT: Right. He, all he’s doing is making me feel more and more insignificant, or as if like the only reason he wants me to think, or I don’t know, my only significance is because he wants to somehow reconcile his feelings of guilt about the whole thing. But it doesn’t feel like ","P1-N400241":"that has anything to do with me at all. [00:09:10]
THERAPIST: It seems to me the, what’s happening with, you know, the year 2014 and you, is those things, kind of those things are similar. The issue with Lucas, I think, where you’ve been really upset about what’s been happening with him, I guess especially over the last month, and ","P1-N4002E1":"have felt any number of terrible things based on what’s happened and what’s true with you. [00:14:09]
CLIENT: Well yeah, I don’t know why I felt that, I would change my own, like I thought that by thinking that way like I could change my attitude about it.
THERAPIST: So what I’m saying is, I think you’ve been so upset about it and felt so awful about it so many times for so long, like you can’t stay on that page, and you have to imagine it’s going to be a new page.
CLIENT: Right. [00:16:01]
THERAPIST: The problem is, it is actually the same job, and so like with Lucas, when you go in and the same shit happens, it’s usually disappointing.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And I think with me, it’s a little more subtle, but I think there’s a similar process that happens where you come in kind of hoping I’ll say something and, you know, in a way, if you step back and it’s not the craziest thing in the world, that will make you feel better. ","P1-N4003E1":"But the things you’re talking about aren’t the sort of things where if you look at it a little different, or you try to approach it a little different, it’s a different situation. [00:17:05]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Like you hate a lot about your job for a long time, you know? And things with Lucas have been shitty for a long time, not a long time, but you know. That’s been really hard, the stuff with him, clearly. And you know, so I think you, you know, of course you’re sad and feeling kind ","P1-N400421":"of confused and unsure what to do, and are hoping I’ll say something that will help you feel better, but what I’m saying is, it’s the same thing. We kind of know. [00:17:05]
CLIENT: Yeah, I know, I know. Well I even had the thought, like as I was waiting to come in here, like I don’t even know where to start, like there’s no point in me, you know, talking today, because like there’s nothing that I’m feeling bad about is anything, like you said, you ","P1-N400441":"could just, you know, like if you change, you know, think about it this way, or you know, approach it this way, and that will help. You know, it’s just—
THERAPIST: So why don’t we think about it? It’s like you, it’s like you have a, you sort of put your hope in the other person or some other thing like you are, because I think, I think because you can’t quite maintain it in yourself, and then when you were about to come in, you, ","P1-N400461":"it’s like that way of approaching this is where it’s been. [00:19:07]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: That’s where I’m going, I think.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And there’s also something going on. [00:20:04]
CLIENT: To hear what?
THERAPIST: What I’m saying.
CLIENT: No. More like no, I don’t think so, I don’t know. [00:20:56]
THERAPIST: Well, I guess also part of this is that I think, I actually do think that this is (inaudible at 00:24:17), but I think you do often feel like other people don’t want to hear about it. [00:24:25]
CLIENT: Aiden did it too. [00:24:56]
THERAPIST: And (inaudible at 00:25:06) with me, but I think there’s probably some of that there as well. I don’t know if it’s because you, oh I can’t actually (inaudible at 00:25:26). Yeah, I don’t think it’s easy to talk about how like you talk about bad things that ","P1-N400681":"happen, and as you were talking about earlier with Lucas over the weekend. [00:26:05]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I sort of have the feeling, actually, when I think about it, you don’t necessarily imagine I will want to hear about how bad some of that stuff is. [00:27:14]
CLIENT: No. I sometimes feel like, I don’t know, like I don’t know how you can help me, like I don’t know. Like I don’t know what’s going to help, like I, like figuring out why I choose the wrong men, like I’m not, I don’t know what I’m supposed to be ","P1-N400701":"focusing on. [00:27:52]
THERAPIST: Okay, so now I think we’re talking about sort of two different dynamics, the one with the men you get involved with, you’re describing that as selfish. I think you’d say that they really let you down. [00:29:05]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But (long pause) [00:31:07]
CLIENT: What do you mean, counts for a lot?
THERAPIST: Well, accounts for a lot of how, why you’re drawn to them.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And yet somehow, our clarifying that, or am I saying that? [00:34:04]
CLIENT: Well I think because it’s like, I will hear you say things or we’ll say things and I’ll be like, “Whoa, that’s a good point.” But okay, so how do I change it then is I think what I always end up feeling. Like so how do I make sure that doesn’t happen ","P1-N4008E1":"anymore? Not be attracted to charming guys? Only date guys that are really unattractive physically because maybe that means they’re a better person or something?
THERAPIST: That’s absolutely what I’d recommend.
CLIENT: Right, you know what I mean? Like I-
THERAPIST: I actually think it is clear, from what I’m saying. [00:35:01]
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Which is ways that you’re feeling shitty about yourself or things in your life that you want so much to look away from, that you, you know, pin your hopes on things that won’t work. The problem with these guys isn’t that they’re charming, nothing wrong with charming. ","P1-N4009A1":"But the problem is, they let you down, and you like, again and again and again, and you let yourself get caught up in that. [00:36:04]
CLIENT: But then, it’s like so then how am I ever going to find somebody who will stay?
THERAPIST: So I mean, even as you’re talking, I think you’re doing kind of the same thing. Maybe I’m misunderstanding, but you’re saying like, “Look, what strategy do I use then?” It’s sort of like what you want from me are like ways to look at it or steps you ","P1-N400A01":"can take to prevent this from happening again. [00:37:11]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Although, in a repeat of what we’re talking about, you know I, you know A, that I’m not going to give you that, and B, it’s because I don’t believe it exists.
CLIENT: Right. Well, there, I don’t either.
THERAPIST: Yeah, and yes, (inaudible at 00:37:38). [00:38:00]
CLIENT: I don’t know. [00:39:57]
THERAPIST: Well, what’s on your mind?
CLIENT: I’m just sick of feeling like shit, and lonely and used or thrown away or unimportant. Like I want people to call me, like I want friends to call me (inaudible at 00:40:37), or I want a guy to be initiating things with me, like I don’t want to be like fucking e-mailing people from ","P1-N400B21":"the Internet or having like stupid back and forths or anything. I don’t want to have to think about it anymore. [00:40:55]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:44:05) things to yourself, and also like reasonably like if it, like he’s going to kind of use you. We’re going to stop for today.
CLIENT: Okay, so I’ll see you on Friday morning? Oh, I got your e-mail on the bill.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: On Friday, I’m going to bring you (inaudible at 00:44:43).
THERAPIST: Okay, thanks.
