TITLE: Client "S", Session November 16, 2012: Client has officially broken up with her boyfriend; she is relieved, excited, and happy to live her life without him holding her back any longer.
DESCRIPTION: Client has officially broken up with her boyfriend; she is relieved, excited, and happy to live her life without him holding her back any longer.
THERAPIST: Yeah, it's my fault (inaudible at 00:03)
CLIENT: Yeah. So, long time no see. I broke up with Franklin (sp?).
THERAPIST: Oh my goodness.
CLIENT: Yeah, which is sorry, I feel like this pen is (inaudible at 00:19). Yeah, because I did it. I was really scared. And here's what happened.
THERAPIST: Yeah, that's a huge deal.
CLIENT: Yeah, like, yeah, indeed (ph). So we went again to see her together last Tuesday or last week Tuesday.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:42)
CLIENT: Exactly (ph). And I went with, like and I told [Steph what I was talking about] (ph). I was like, "I'd really like to talk about some things that I didn't get a chance to mention last week." So he was already like, "Well, I don't like the way that you're putting that and I don't know what ","P1-N400191":"that means and blah blah." Whatever. Like, you'll see.
THERAPIST: You've been struggling with this for a really long time. It was very hard and you did it.
CLIENT: Yeah, and you know what and I was like, "You know, we have still, like, money and clothes and the cats. The cats are yours now." You know, just very, like which I know it's painful for him or whatever. So, OK. So that happened. It was election night. I went over to my friend Jillian's house ","P1-N4002F1":"afterwards and, like, drank a bunch of wine and watched the election results and talked about my (inaudible at 06:47). And everybody was literally like, "Oh my god, you actually did it? Because I really never thought you were going to do it." I was like, "Me either." I left to go visit my best friend ","P1-N4002F2":"on Friday. It's, like, so [perfectly timed a good trip] (ph). And he had sent me a message that he was going to pick up his stuff no Saturday and leave the keys and to please leave the parking pass, so now I can no longer park in (inaudible at 07:13), which sucks, but, [you know] (ph).
THERAPIST: Two days ago?
CLIENT: No no, last week. Yeah, like, the day...
THERAPIST: ...before he packed his stuff?
CLIENT: Yeah, so before I packed. That was like, you know, "First, one thing, I'm proud of you for making the decision that you did. I know that it must have been really difficult for you." So I'm glad that he acknowledged that. That was very impressive. And it was just like, you know, "I wanted to ","P1-N4003D1":"thank you for all the things you did for me. I wouldn't be the person I am without you. Like, I know that you'll get what you deserve," and blah blah blah blah blah. Very nice, like, goodbye, like, best of luck.
THERAPIST: Does she know?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: So I'm slowly telling she's known about this whole situation. [I've always] (ph) made it known and now I've, like, slowly started to tell people at work and then whoever I didn't tell will find out at the holiday party because they'll be like (inaudible at 12:21), which is early December. ","P1-N4004D1":"So, like, it's fine. I don't mind telling people. I don't want a lot of, like, questions and stuff but, like, I think it's important for people to know at work. So I'm telling people but the people that I work, like, most directly with that might have seen me, like, noticed (inaudible at 12:41) or whatever, ","P1-N4004D2":"I've told.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I know OK.
CLIENT: So I felt like it would be helpful for me to get some closure on that situation by going to meet with her again, so I did that and it was really helpful.
THERAPIST: She mentioned something about meeting with you individually and she was sort of starting to talk about it and that's where I [told her to stop] (ph). It must have been just after she met with you.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Makes sense. And that was really helpful and she actually gave me some insight into basically she said, "I think something that might be really important for you moving forward and (inaudible at 13:57) with Ethan (ph) is to kind of explore why if, you know, a fundamental feeling ","P1-N400571":"of trust and security wasn't there from the very beginning of your relationship, why did you pursue, why did you stay, why did you continue?" And I was like, "Honestly, thank you for pointing that out because I really hadn't thought about that. This whole time that's not I mean, like, I've questioned, ","P1-N400572":"you know, why have I, like, bothered and why have I dealt with this stuff for so long. But, like, I hadn't really thought about, like, why from the very beginning, like, very beginning like first month there wasn't trust, that I let it go and wanted to do it anyway. And I realize that that's probably ","P1-N400573":"really important also moving forward in relationships because I don't want to do that. [00:14:48]
THERAPIST: You have a break-up buddy.
CLIENT: Yeah, a break-up buddy. It's good. And, like, newly single buddy too. She was like like, one of the first things she said, she's like, "I know that you really don't care about finding a nice Jewish boy, but I do. So please come to the Ball with me," which is, like, this, like, stupid Jewish ","P1-N4005F1":"singles, which I've gone to before. And I've always been like, "Blah. Like, I hate all of you." But I'm going to go and it's because [there's eating] (ph). So I was like, "All right, well just, like, we'll go to Christmas dinner at my mom's and then go the Ball later, whatever." At least it's fun, like, ","P1-N4005F2":"we'll look cute, like, whatever. She can try to find a nice Jewish lawyer. I don't care. If I meet somebody, then I meet somebody. If not, I'm not being (ph) whatever. [00:17:06]
THERAPIST: You did it.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think that's the biggest thing. Like, I did it and this is something that I was struggling with and not sure of. And I, like, feel so sure now. I mean, like, there's still a little bit of conflicted feelings of like, "Should I have worked that out longer? You know, could there have been ","P1-N400651":"better times [about that] (ph)?" But then as soon as that thought pops in all of the, like, other bullshit pops in. I'm like, "No. like, the answer is no. It wasn't working. It wasn't going to work. It's not going to work. Done." And then, you know, all those other things, those, like, unchangeable ","P1-N400652":"things like the family and the personality traits that I wouldn't ask him to change and all those other little things, it's now, like, I don't have to worry about that anymore. Like, I can somebody that has a better family now. Like, I can actually make that part of my life requirements. I don't have ","P1-N400653":"to settle. [00:18:31]
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're holding up. I mean, it's been a rocky week but, I mean, it's been sad and sometimes it's [going to want to be] (ph) on your mind. But you aren't depressed and capacitated or...
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: ...hopeless or anything like that.
CLIENT: I worry that he is, but I talked to one of his friends the other day and she said that they were out and that they're going to the beach in December. And so he's clearly he's fine. Like, I'm not (inaudible at 19:30) he's depressed, he's sad. I broke up with him. Like, justified (ph). Like, ","P1-N4006F1":"of course he's going to (inaudible at 19:34) and I mean, he's liking pages...
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 19:36)
CLIENT: ...with girls now so clearly he's good about that, on the female front (ph), which I never had any doubt about and wouldn't even be surprised if he reached back out to Betty like, "Hey, by the way." And, like, the greatest thing about all that is, like, not my problem. Not my problem. And I ","P1-N400731":"can flirt with boys and it's not a problem either. It's great. I'm happy. Like, sure I want to find somebody but, like, I'm not in a rush right now. I'm like, really it's nice to just live, like, super, just for myself. Like, all of my plans. I don't have to tell people plans. I don't have to make time. ","P1-N400732":"Like, I know not that I know, but to me this, like, sounds a little bad but, like, not bad like I don't know. It sounds like I guess that I can be selfish but, like, not having to make time for other people, like, another person. (laughter) I don't have to deal with you, like, being sad because ","P1-N400733":"I have too many plans this weekend with my friends. I get to just have too many plans with my friends and be awesome. [00:20:46]
THERAPIST: Perfect (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah, it's just great.
THERAPIST: That's good.
CLIENT: (sighs) So that's, like, obviously all that's going on in my life for the most part. I told...
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 21:18)
CLIENT: Yeah. I told my parents and stuff. And obviously, they're supportive if not jumping for joy secretly. (laughter) Which is fine. Like, I'm a little bit jumping for joy secretly too. I mean, it's going to be a year of firsts. Like, first Thanksgiving without him in two years, first Christmas, ","P1-N400811":"first birthday, first new year's. So, like, OK, we'll see how I feel during those times. But I'm not, like, that worried. I mean, I am a little bit at a loss for, like, new year's because, like, we always just, like, do something together or, like, having alone I don't know. It's just and my friend ","P1-N400812":"is, like, going on, like, one of those booze cruise things and she's like, "Oh, come." But, like, it's a bunch of couples and I'm like I don't know.
THERAPIST: Right, and you'll be fine, yeah. [00:22:17]
CLIENT: But the new year's is more social, so I'm wondering what I'll want to do or get invited to or whatever. I also want to have a party at my house with just my friends that I only I throw and it's only my friends. So I think that'll be exciting as well. I told my roommate and she's been also really ","P1-N400871":"supportive and nice. Yeah, it's an (ph) interesting time. I mean, I think it's great. I'm, like, really pleased, to tell you the truth. I mean, yeah, I'm, like, a little bit like, "When am I going to find somebody? When am I going to find somebody? Like, how it's (ph) going to be?" But it's not, like, ","P1-N400872":"paralyzing me. It's not, like, you know, oh my god. Like, I'm not obsessing over it. I mean, because in the meantime, like, I can just date or hookup or, like, flirt. And that's also fine. And, like, I (ph) don't have to find a potential husband. It can just be somebody, like, it could be a rebound, ","P1-N400873":"like, whatever, you know. And that's awesome. [00:23:29]
THERAPIST: You may have (inaudible at 25:20)
CLIENT: So I think that's going to be really fun. We're not charging anybody. We're paying. Me and my friends [who are] (ph) doing it, we're paying out of pocket for, like, a deejay, a little bit of food.
THERAPIST: Sorry, what is it?
CLIENT: Ten year high school reunion.
THERAPIST: I know that. When you say you and your friends are doing it, what do you mean?
CLIENT: So, like, some people in our group of friends on Facebook were starting to be, like, wait. Isn't the high school reunion, like, supposed to be in November? Has anybody heard anything? Have you gotten an invite? Like, what's going on? Like, we thought there was some magical...
THERAPIST: Yeah, I figured it'd be something like, yeah (inaudible at 25:54) thing, right?
CLIENT: But there's not. So, like, when I got in touch with the reunion office, like, "No. Like, you're the one." And I was like, "Are you kidding me?" so, like, this is why it was a little bit last minute. And they didn't have a great database of e-mails and they were going to charge us 140 dollars ","P1-N4009D1":"for it anyway. And we didn't have time and didn't want to spend the money on an invitation, like mail and plus who's address is actually, yeah, the reunion office has (ph). Like, nobody's (ph).
THERAPIST: That's cool.
CLIENT: And I'm even more excited now that, like, I'm 100 percent over Franklin (sp?) because then I don't have to, like, feel weird about not inviting him or, like, all this stuff. And I can totally just enjoy and catch up with people and...
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 27:45) wonderful thing to look forward to.
CLIENT: I'm really psyched. So that's next Friday. And of course I had a like, this one girl that I know, first she's like, "Oh my god. I live above that bar." And I was like, "Perfect, that's a party at your house, ha ha ha." And then she was like, "I mean, aren't these things supposed to be done, ","P1-N400A91":"like, a little nicer though? Like, isn't this supposed to be, like, in a hotel or something?" And I was like, "If you'd like to pay 50 dollars a ticket for you and your guest, I'm happy to call the hotel. Like, this is free and last minute and nobody else is doing it. So are you coming or not?" (laughter) ","P1-N400A92":"Like, I kind of just shut her down and she's like, "You're right." (laughter) You know. I'm like, it's free. Like, come or don't come. I don't care if your preference (ph) is at the Hilton. Like, ours at this bar. She's like, "That bar sucks." I was like, "I don't care. The room is free. Like, what ","P1-N400A93":"does it matter, you know? There's drinks. Like, it's (inaudible at 28:31) honey. Do whatever you want."
THERAPIST: Nobody's doing anything about it.
CLIENT: Nobody's doing anything. So, like, we did it. Don't complain. Come. It's going to be fun. And bring whoever. That's the beauty of it. Like, bring whoever. Your five friends that didn't graduate because they failed out of freshmen year? Bring them. Like, what do I care? Your kids? Fine. And that's ","P1-N400AF1":"what's great about not having to charge people. I mean, certainly we are paying out of pocket for some stuff and we understand that but I'm happy to do it. I mean, I think that it'll make it more fun. It's bringing more people because it's free and it's casual. Yeah, so that's going to be in a week ","P1-N400AF2":"and that'll be great.
THERAPIST: You could see if people wanted to donate. I mean, like, (inaudible at 29:31)
CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Like, at the thing. Like, you know, if you'd like to, whatever. But it's not...
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 29:38)
CLIENT: Yeah, it's not [that important] (ph). I was going to say something else that I forgot. I don't remember. I think it's been really good to, like, throw myself into that as well during all of this, because I love events and I think it's something that's been helping me, because it's just something else.
THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like you've got things keeping you busy. You say it sounds like a (inaudible at 30:06) you have a bunch of plans this weekend and then you've got Thanksgiving and then the reunion. Not a lot of time to sit around at home.
CLIENT: I feel like I've been neglecting the cats but I'm sure they'll bounce back. Yeah, it's (ph) good. I mean, I definitely want to get myself into my own, like, single routine, like, single person routine that's good for me in terms of being back on, like, eating right and my Weight Watchers and ","P1-N400BB1":"working out more and, like, working out at all. (laughter) Just making sure I take care of myself and all of that stuff. But I'm not serious (ph). Like, now I want to eat good food and I want to drink and I want to smoke cigarettes when I drink sometimes and I want to not work out because I want to ","P1-N400BB2":"sleep more. Like, I (inaudible at 31:00) and I'm allowing myself that. I'm like, I'll lose weight, like, if I gain weight. Like, I'm not, like, worried that I'm going to be in some, like, hole of, like, eating pizza every night or something.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you want to take it a bit easy on yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah, which I totally deserve.
THERAPIST: Yes, this was very hard to do.
CLIENT: I know. It's crazy, like, how I was I would come in here or I'd be talking to my friends or thinking about it and it was just so, like, I couldn't imagine how to do it and I didn't know how to do it and I don't know how to do it and whatever. And then, like, now that, like, I really just did ","P1-N400C31":"it, like, ripped the Band-Aid off, I just feel so much better. Like, I just feel more like myself and, like, a weight has really been lifted. And it's just...
THERAPIST: Do you [even want to] (ph) talk about what made it so scary, from the other side of it?
CLIENT: No. Just that it was going to go how it went. Like, I was just scared of it going how I knew it would go. And then it went that way and it hurt and it sucked and I felt like he's being a jerk and whatever. But, like, that's what I was scared of. And maybe because, like, I I don't know. I mean, ","P1-N400C71":"I knew it would go this way. Like, I literally knew how it would be. And I was scared of it. I was scared of dealing with it and dealing with the clothes packing that I knew I would have to do and the cats and the whole...
THERAPIST: [You're like] (ph) sort of scared. [It made you] (ph) angry and you're feeling guilty. [00:32:52]
CLIENT: Exactly.
THERAPIST: Scared at the sense of, like, a sadness and loss and being unknown.
CLIENT: Right. And I did feel a little guilty but, like, that's kind of passed already. Like, I kind of am over it. I have nothing to feel guilty about. I tried as much as anybody would ever tolerate trying in this relationship, like, ever. And there's really...
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 33:22)
CLIENT: Yeah, and there's really nothing that I should feel guilty about. I'm not even, like, "Oh, I'm breaking your heart." I don't. It happens. That's life. People break up. And it was just, like, big thing and of course he made it, like I said, you know, "We didn't get to experience our best of our ","P1-N400D31":"relationship yet and you're cutting it off." All right, well, all right, I'll be that person then (laughter) that didn't let this relationship get like, we had plenty of time to have bests and we couldn't do it.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 33:56)
CLIENT: So (inaudible at 33:58). So I'm really looking forward to the weekend because, I mean, last weekend was great and I was away and it was great to be away. But this weekend I think it's going to be nice to be home. And I'm going out to dinner with my friends Jillian and Stephanie tonight. And ","P1-N400D71":"I know Stephanie also is going to want to be going out every single night and doing stuff. So, you know, and then tomorrow, like I don't know. This is, like, my first weekend here single in six years and, like, that's a crazy thought. Go crazy. (laughter) Which I won't. Right, so it's great. I mean, ","P1-N400D72":"like, I'm really lucky to have great support from my friends and family. That's been really important (inaudible at 34:48) (sighs)
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 35:08) on the other side of it.
CLIENT: It's so nice to be on the side of it. I mean, like, some of the things like, I've been joking now. Like, I'm feeling a little better today, whatever, yesterday. I'm like, "Darn it, now I have to find a new IT person. I have to find a new person to lift things in my house, to help me clip the ","P1-N400DD1":"cats' nails. Like, I need to find another guy to, like, come help me turn the mattress every three months." Which are so, like, insignificant and I think that's kind of why I'm like, "Ha ha ha."
THERAPIST: Right, that is sort of funny.
CLIENT: Right. Yeah, it's great to be on the other side of that fence or wall or whatever I was facing that I thought I couldn't get over. So I don't have to deal with bullshit and his sulking and his murder (ph) and it's not my problem anymore. (sighs) I am proud of myself too. I'm glad that he said ","P1-N400E11":"he's proud of me because I'm proud of myself. It was a fucking difficult decision. Like, fuck yeah. But I did it. [00:36:12]
THERAPIST: Do you feel like people around you have a sense of how hard it was for you and are proud of you doing it?
CLIENT: Pardon?
THERAPIST: Do you feel like people around you have a sense of how hard it was for you and are proud of you for having done it?
CLIENT: Yeah, definitely. You know, especially, you know, my mom and my friends. They are. Especially the ones that were so involved with talking to me about it a lot and, you know, my friend Jennifer in Chicago who I've been reaching out to a lot. And she actually she was like, finally, towards the ","P1-N400E91":"end of, l, deciding that I was going to just do it, she was like, "All right. Time to take off my, like, good-friend social worker hat and tell you that I knew this wasn't going to work out from the first time you texted me Trina (sp?). Like, from every time that I talked to you, like, I knew you weren't ","P1-N400E92":"going to be able to be in this relationship. Obviously you needed to have your process but, like, you need to just finally make the decision because you and I and probably everybody else that you talk to about this has known for a long time that it's not going to work." She's like, "So, there." I was ","P1-N400E93":"like, "You're right." [00:37:16]
THERAPIST: I see, instead of (inaudible at 38:10) California.
CLIENT: That was a different conference. But usually we have an event every year here (inaudible at 38:14) board members and specialists (ph) and everything. And we're dong Brazil this year because it's the ten year anniversary of our office in Brazil. And I get to go. It's going to be winter there. ","P1-N400EF1":"But then we'll come back and it'll be spring. And I mean, who cares, like, it'll be winter in Brazil. I've never been to Brazil so I don't really care what season it is. (laughter) So that's something that's really exciting to look forward to.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: Yeah, I just feel a lot better and it's crazy. Like, even being here to, like, think about how it felt coming in, what I wanted to talk about for the past I don't know even know year? And, like, now. I almost a little bit have to, like, think about now, like, what do I talk about? (laughter) ","P1-N400F51":"It's like I can talk about anything. I don't have to, like, deal with this everyday anymore.
THERAPIST: You sound very relieved. And it's been sort of tough coming in here (pause) because you've really been struggling with this. You've been very afraid of ending it and (inaudible at 39:38) to see how you could really make it work and frustrated how you sort of kept trying to do things to fix ","P1-N400F71":"it that didn't fix it.
CLIENT: Yeah. It's still sad. Like, it's going to be sad. But it's, like, an OK sad, like, and a necessary. Like, it's necessary. I haven't told spoken to any his family or, like, the girlfriends of his crewmembers or anything like that really yet. And I've debated if that's going to, like, help me ","P1-N400F91":"with closure or if it's unnecessary. So I'm not doing anything for now. And he can tell them all first and then maybe I'll reach. Or maybe I won't. I don't know. Like, either way, like, [it's not a big loss] (ph). Like, if his family were awesome it'd be different. This is, like, actually something ","P1-N400F92":"that I'm relieved (laughter), like, to not be a part of. But I'll think about that and decide I think later [if I want to] (ph). It's just, well, it's the right decision.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 40:52)
CLIENT: Yes. I do think that my dad is like secretly like, "Oh my god." I mean, like, I know that he's sad that I'm hurting.
THERAPIST: He was not a big fan of Franklin (sp?)?
CLIENT: He was just not a big fan of yeah. My brother wasn't either. I know that my brother I mean, everybody's like, "Oh my god. I'm so sorry." Like, that's all right. But I know that my brother didn't like him and, you know, the family issue. That's a huge issue in my family. It's like they're ","P1-N401011":"not normal but they're more normal. (laughter) Less dysfunctional I guess should be the better way to describe it.
THERAPIST: OK. I guess congratulations.
CLIENT: Thanks.
THERAPIST: I don't know if that's the thing you say but it sounds like [that's kind of] (ph) how you feel.
CLIENT: Yeah, I've been like a little bit there have been some jumping for joy moments. So thanks, yeah. Yay. So I'll see you on Monday then. OK. Let me know if anything changes.
THERAPIST: Yes, absolutely.
CLIENT: And yeah, if you talk to Jessica. I mean, she said [that it just might be] (ph) helpful or something.
THERAPIST: Sure, absolutely. I will try to get in touch with her. I don't know if we'll connect before Monday but I will speak with her (inaudible at 42:19).
CLIENT: Great. Thanks Ethan (ph). See you on Monday.
THERAPIST: Yeah, take care.
