DESCRIPTION: Client discusses death in the family and how her relatives deal with it. Client discusses a family history of illness and obesity.
THERAPIST: I’m glad that this will work. (inaudible at [00:00:07]).
CLIENT: So I don’t think I mentioned this last week. Did I talk at all about one of my cousins?
THERAPIST: No, okay.
CLIENT: So one of my cousins, on my dad’s side, my cousin Daniel (sp)—
THERAPIST: Yeah, I know. He was in the hospital with like (inaudible at [00:00:33]).
CLIENT: He had an enlarged heart, he had pneumonia, he had like everything. Yeah, and he like, they kept him for like a couple weeks, which, given that he’s poor and getting on Medicare, is pretty impressive. So that was like, yeah, you actually need to manage your diabetes as opposed to ignoring ","P1-N400161":"it, et cetera, et cetera. [00:00:57]
THERAPIST: Is that also a consequence of diabetes that’s not well managed?
CLIENT: So he also did a lot of drugs and alcohol and other things, but I think in actuality, not managing his diabetes at all was the problem that is making his kidneys fail. He’s always felt, he’s been convinced for a long time that he’s going to die by the time he’s forty. ","P1-N4001C1":"He’s thirty-nine, so he’s been like, well there’s no point, because I’m just going back and forth, (inaudible at [00:01:46]). So he hasn’t been taking good care of himself, and like I thought that any other hospital was going to do, get him to manage his diabetes, but not ","P1-N4001C2":"really, or damage done. [00:02:04]
THERAPIST: Does he have a trauma history?
CLIENT: Hm?
THERAPIST: Does he have a trauma history?
CLIENT: Like a traumatic event happening to him?
THERAPIST: Sort of. I did ask because of like a (inaudible at [00:02:22]) T-shirt thing? Did you hear about that?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: A ton of people who have advanced trauma, not always, but sometimes have a like foreshortened sense of their future. They just don’t, it can sort of manifest a few different ways, but they say that, like I’m going to die young, would be consistent with that. Not that there aren’t ","P1-N4002A1":"many of us that think that.
CLIENT: Yeah, so his parents fought a lot and like in and out of being married, and so for awhile he went to live with my, with our grandmother. [00:03:09]
THERAPIST: You seem kind of (inaudible at [00:07:48]).
CLIENT: Yeah, it’s so, it’s really frustrating that I really thought that last year he was going to, it seemed like he was going to like do things. [00:08:10]
THERAPIST: Like there’s something about his activity around managing the diabetes that is like matters more than anything else? [00:10:14]
CLIENT: Yeah, because he’s very, he’s really hot-tempered, and he like tends to pursue things, I guess, vigorously for lack of a better word, like, so it’s weird that he’s just not doing anything. I mean, he, when he was in prison the last time, he got his GED, which, you know, ","P1-N400421":"is impressive. And apparently he was the person that other prisoners went to if they were having math problems, which was, I had no idea. [00:11:02]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at [00:13:17])
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I, kind of like, with the other, I don’t know, like cancers have like, well it’s out of the blue, like there’s nothing that they could have done, really. And then my grandmother and grandfather, you know, they had bad health, but again, like a heart attack. Especially ","P1-N4004C1":"if you’re scared to be in an ambulance, like nothing’s going to happen. [00:13:58]
THERAPIST: Lied about your weight, you mean? Or—
CLIENT: Well, I called and asked about the policy, and they’re like well, they actually said if you’re over this BMI, you’re obviously not healthy enough to donate. And I was like well, but can I write you a doctor’s note? They’re like, “No.” Like okay. I’m ","P1-N400541":"like, so that concerns me. Having one kidney’s not great either. [00:15:56]
THERAPIST: How often do you generally talk to him?
CLIENT: I don’t, like I talk to him a couple times a year. I just don’t, I hate talking with him. And he’s funny in that both he and his mother would, they love to ask questions, but never want to answer questions, so he’s always asking questions about what I’m doing, and ","P1-N4005A1":"my life, but if I ask and he’s like, “That’s really personal.” I’m like oh, like including things like just everything, just like Daniel, if you’re going to ask me twenty questions, I get to ask you twenty questions. [00:17:03]
THERAPIST: And did you hear back about donating a kidney, or you still haven’t heard?
CLIENT: So they’re not at that, they’re not at that stage yet.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: For a second, I’m like, it sounds like probably mid-April, end of April the doctor will be able to say something useful about like how to get tested, where, I’m assuming living in Manchester I could find someplace to do something, I don’t know.
THERAPIST: Is he in Columbus?
CLIENT: He’s in Cincinnati.
THERAPIST: Cincinnati, okay. Somewhere, conceptually.
CLIENT: And also, I’m just like, yeah, he hasn’t like use for, he doesn’t have a lot of money, his girlfriend makes some money, but like he’s going to have to go on disability. [00:18:05]
THERAPIST: Oh good.
CLIENT: Which is good, because that stuff is hellacious. But it’s one of those things where I’m like being a black male in Cincinnati, or in Indiana is like, let’s knock thirty years off your life expectancy, or put you in jail.
THERAPIST: Or both.
CLIENT: Or both, yeah. And it’s just, and like that’s just, like there’s nothing I can do about that. He doesn’t want to move, and not like it would help, but like it’s hard to just try thinking, like school to prison pipeline. [00:19:13]
THERAPIST: No, I’m sure they don’t. (inaudible at [00:19:33])
CLIENT: Yeah, because that makes me feel fatalistic, just like well, you were kind of screwed from the start, but and also like, I don’t know, I got caught up for a little while thinking about the logistics of how that would work, like would I have to go to Cincinnati for a month, do you know ","P1-N4007A1":"what I mean? [00:20:00]
THERAPIST: So it’s a pattern of blame?
CLIENT: A lot of blaming.
THERAPIST: I think I’d have grievances, but (inaudible at [00:23:08]).
CLIENT: Yeah. And he, it’s one of those things where I’m like, “Well, I don’t think, yeah your parents had some problems.” But so when we were kids, his parents had a nicer house than my parents did, and his, I think his dad actually made possibly as much as, like a, salary ","P1-N400881":"comparable to my dad. He worked for Pepsi, a regional sales manager, whatever, whatever. And his mom worked too, so like they had money, and various things happened. ‘[00:23:08]
THERAPIST: Sure, yeah, I can recall some of them.
CLIENT: Yeah, and it’s also sort of like an argument that I can’t win.
THERAPIST: Right. But it actually feels like he’s sort of working pretty hard there to defend himself.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you need a way of sort of externalizing it.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, part of the thing is like I do feel a certain amount of guilt or discomfort with like, yeah, I have succeeded like better than he has, but, you know, I don’t know. It’s also a little unfair to me what he thinks are the things that make my parents, gave my brother and I. [00:26:04]
THERAPIST: Like a lot of his life is incredibly sad, and unfortunate.
CLIENT: Yeah, like he made a series of horrible decisions and for the last like, I don’t know, eight, nine years like that, he’s been doing a lot better, like the last time he was in prison he was like, “Wait, fuck this.”
THERAPIST: Yeah. Is that when he got his GED?
CLIENT: So the second felony, and third felony you’re in jail for like—so he’s like, “I don’t want to be in prison for—”
THERAPIST: Yeah, that’s true.
CLIENT: And the last time he was in prison, he also like asked for his family members to pay his child support for his daughter. [00:27:05]
THERAPIST: Taking (inaudible at [00:28:31]).
CLIENT: Like taking orders, or he just woke up. He’s no longer physically, like thankfully, he will no longer punch you, but he’s just a really tall, big guy who will yell and get in your face, and might punch the wall. So I kind of see why people get freaked out. [00:28:58]
THERAPIST: I see, where it had been sort of like a change of trajectory towards more positive stuff, like he was on the way up.
CLIENT: Yeah, like it really was like we had a (inaudible at [00:31:37]) long conversations about one of my other cousins had said that (inaudible at [00:31:44]), you know, it was like a waste, like he just wasted his life, whatever. And I was talking to Daniel, like I was actually proud of him for ","P1-N400B41":"making all these changes, and that he’d gotten his GED was really amazing, because they’re hard to get, and you know, so we had this type of long conversation where I was like, “No, like I’m really proud of you. You have done such great things.” [00:32:07]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And, you know, I don’t want to talk about to Jamie (sp) because she’ll give me a medical consult and I don’t want that. And I don’t know. I’m just finding it hard to talk about.
THERAPIST: It’s really upsetting.
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:32:59]
THERAPIST: It’s really bothering you a lot.
CLIENT: Yeah, and it’s just like—
THERAPIST: My sense is like is it something because of what’s happening to him? Sort of reflect in a depressing way about the world he lived in?
CLIENT: Yeah, and my other fear is that I won’t be able to donate a kidney because of my weight, and—
THERAPIST: It probably doesn’t make you feel any better about any of that.
CLIENT: Right, it’s infuriating, and it’s one of those things where I’m like, would I attempt to voluntarily lose weight which I don’t think would work for that purpose, and then like, like I don’t know. It just brings up like that spectre of would you try to lose weight ","P1-N400CA1":"for medical reasons? And my basic answer is no. [00:33:56]
THERAPIST: Right. I imagine, maybe I’m wrong, but that might be because you’re angry and don’t buy into why you have to in the first place, or is it different?
CLIENT: Well, it’s sort of a couple things. It’s like most of the time what is happening is that for whoever’s sake you need to lose weight is assuming that I’m very sedentary, that I eat lots of fast food, that I eat, like I assume gross lean cuisine or I drink diet soda. Like they assume—
THERAPIST: They don’t really know.
CLIENT: Yeah, I’m like no—
THERAPIST: Actually, you live quite a healthy way.
CLIENT: Yeah, and also like while these are like medical conditions that like are affected by weight, they’re just like, “Lose weight.” And also dieting almost always fails. It’s one of those big depressing like 80 percent of people who diet gain it back. [00:35:11]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Like I don’t care. But I actually don’t know that it’s, I could.
THERAPIST: Lose it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Which might not work.
CLIENT: Yeah, that’s the thing. It’s like it just might not work, and it’s, it’s yeah, like I don’t know. My father’s sister is (inaudible at [00:35:53]), like off and on all their lives.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I’m like, and just, you know, it’s like weight loss doesn’t, like it’s really hard to lose weight, it’s really hard to keep it off. I don’t enjoy the things that you have to do to try to like drop weight. [00:36:17]
THERAPIST: Bariatric surgery?
CLIENT: Yeah. So, and she didn’t really tell anyone, so this is a (inaudible at [00:36:58]) worker but who’s overweight. She’s fat. [00:37:02]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: It’s like pisses me off, which also set me off into a tizzy. But the reason, the reason that she told me was pretty much because I’m also fat. She’s like, “Well you know how,” she’s like, “You know how it is,” like I went to the doctor, and I don’t ","P1-N400F41":"want to have diabetes, I don’t want to blah, blah, blah, so I decided to do this. And I’m just like, like I didn’t say anything negative. [00:37:59]
THERAPIST: Yeah, she just had it done.
CLIENT: Well, and also, yeah, like she did it, she has control of her own body. It was like a new bariatric procedure was going, but she looks like a wreck because right now she can’t really eat anything. So the way they mostly work, it’s just horrifying, is so—
THERAPIST: Makes a like whole, like pulling the way out of your stomach so small that you can’t eat very much, right?
CLIENT: This particular kind basically kind of smushes half your stomach, or blocks it off or something. So you can only eat a very small amount of food, and you just start eating only a very small amount of very soft food. [00:39:01]
THERAPIST: Right, you could be malnourished, right, very easily.
CLIENT: Yes, and so she looks exhausted, her skin was horrible. I mean, she looked sick and terrible. And that, and like she made that decision not because she’s currently having medical problems, but because she’s sort of bought into if you’re fat, you’re going to die.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: There’s this like sort of joke. [00:40:00]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And so—
THERAPIST: Flashing lights, cutoff.
CLIENT: Yeah, so one of my friends who’s like, “Oh yeah, I’m def that size.” He’s over 300 pounds. And so several people were just like, “Yep, I’m def fatty. I’m going to die of that right now.” And I feel like my coworker kind of believed it. Like ","P1-N401121":"she doesn’t, you know, she said, “Well I don’t want to have diabetes.” And I’m like, yes, but.
THERAPIST: Right, so like similarly, really depressing.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: About like the culture with that. [00:41:07]
CLIENT: Yeah, and like my concerns about being too fat to donate an organ combine with her doing like very edgy surgery. It’s just like I don’t know. It makes me not want to eat. Like which is weird, but well also (inaudible at [00:41:38]) makes me not want to eat, but I don’t know. ","P1-N4011A1":"It just makes me stressed thinking about it.
THERAPIST: I’m confused.
CLIENT: So it’s hard to, so the way that one of the ways that dieting plays out (inaudible at [00:42:02]), especially never quits her social groups, is everyone talks about diets. [00:42:07]
THERAPIST: If not all three.
CLIENT: What?
THERAPIST: If not all three of them.
CLIENT: Yeah. At any moment, so that I find horrible and try to sort of cut off, and also (inaudible at [00:42:32]) people who are doing, it’s like dieting thing, they’re talking about, “Oh, I can’t have that full, I can’t have a whole donut, I can’t just pig out ","P1-N401281":"on whatever.” And usually I’m like, “Well, fuck you. I’m going to whatever.”
THERAPIST: And create opportunities too, like, you know like so many things, we’re like, “Oh my God, I’m so hungry, I could eat half a sandwich.”
CLIENT: Yeah. And (inaudible at [00:42:58]). Like sometimes my reaction is to be like, “Fuck you. I’m having the biggest salad in the universe.” And sometimes I’m like, “Fuck you, I’m going to have a burger and fries,” like you know. [00:43:08]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Or just not lose as much weight as you hoped, so you can have bariatric surgery and still be fat.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Just not as fat. So there is that. And then I feel like well, but what if my weight was like the only thing keeping me from doing this? Would like, would like, someone, would people like judge me for not trying to diet? Like it’s—dieting is so expected and so assumed. Like that’s ","P1-N401361":"what we want to do, and that it’s just a thing you can do, and if you don’t, you’re lazy. I feel like if that was, if that was the thing, and I’m like building it up, you know, think weight would be the only thing. But it makes me feel like it was a judgment of like why couldn’t ","P1-N401362":"you lose, you know, like twenty pounds.
THERAPIST: I see. [00:45:00]
CLIENT: To save someone’s life, or whatever. And I’m just like, “But it’s not like that, and fuck.” Like I don’t know.
THERAPIST: It’s kind of an emotional minefield.
CLIENT: Yeah. Amazingly, my mom did not get on me about being diabetic.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: I was really shocked. She actually was relatively calm, all things considered, especially considering that she’d also had decided like five or six years ago that my dad was going to need to go on dialysis at any moment, which wasn’t true.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: We should stop. [00:45:58]
CLIENT: Thank you. I think I’ll be talking about it for awhile.
THERAPIST: Sorry.
CLIENT: That’s okay.
