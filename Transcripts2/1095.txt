TITLE: Client "Ma", Session March 28, 2014: Client discusses the possibility of taking a new job in another state.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the possibility of taking a new job in another state.
THERAPIST: remember.
CLIENT: I’ll try; I’ll remind you.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Okay. But like I find it very – I don’t like looking at the clock.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I don’t mind checking it and making sure we’re done.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: You know, I also -
CLIENT: Actually, do you actually – do you have 10 open on Monday?
THERAPIST: Yeah, I do.
CLIENT: Because that would work this week, because Ryan Evan’s out of town.
THERAPIST: Okay. You want that?
CLIENT: Yeah; that sounds great.
THERAPIST: Okay, so now I can [overlapping conversation at 0:00:31]
CLIENT: I guess I’ll take it then. (laughter)
THERAPIST: All right, that I’m going to write down, because now I’m on, you know, whatever. (pause)
CLIENT: Can I ask you to send me a text or something?
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) Today, so Monday is the 31st I think. Okay, and I forget, do you have an iPhone?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Okay, that means I can’t just text you from my phone.
CLIENT: Okay; here, you know, I’m just going to (inaudible at 0:01:12) (chuckle)
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: I don’t have a pen on me, so I usually have one.
THERAPIST: Oh I have one.
CLIENT: Oh yeah. (pause) Thanks.
THERAPIST: Sure. (pause)
CLIENT: So I did go to work today also, so I just got off work. (pause) (sigh) It’s weird being physically sick, because like it’s a lot worse to be depressed. But or mostly like, [all this] (ph) really suck. (laughter)
THERAPIST: Were you at work yesterday?
CLIENT: Yeah. I just got a (inaudible at 0:02:08). And so, it’s much worse to be depressed, but I still have to get up and go to work. It’s actually better for me if I do, because I usually end up like pulling out of it for a while. I’m like why can’t I control this? (laughter) ","P1-N400411":"Realizing that no I really just have to take the day off for this thing that seems really minor.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And it’s just weird.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah like being depressed is so much heavier.
CLIENT: Yeah. (laughter)
THERAPIST: And so much harder, and yet like that you have to (inaudible at 0:03:02) at work. But being sick in a way that’s a drag, but not as bad.
CLIENT: Yeah. I just feel like really guilty about it, I just felt really bad, and I thought for a while that I was going to have to take Wednesday off, or Thursday off too, because I was still felt bad on Thursday, I just went into work anyway. But I thought like I wasn’t going to be able to ","P1-N4004D1":"go in, and so (sigh) I just felt really guilty.
THERAPIST: Starting to feel you’re done with this one?
CLIENT: A little bit. I mean, well it’s hard, because today was a really good day. And like in some ways, it really gives me things I really need out of my work, and in some ways, it really doesn’t give me things that I need. So like, how do you balance that?
THERAPIST: Yeah, I don’t know what’s up; yeah, I think I’m fine though.
CLIENT: at the Boys and Girls Club, and (sigh) she was like having sort of a tough day, like much (clamere) (sp?) and shyer than she often is. She’s not really a social butterfly most the time, like she’s sort of wary of strangers both small and large. But then she was like playing some, ","P1-N4006B1":"and not playing some, and I was trying to (bust) (ph) in there to help her. But also tried not to like follow her around all the time, because that’s not actually good for her. And I just looked around and it’s pretty full; I just thought – I just feel like this is a room full of adults ","P1-N4006B2":"trying with more or less success to look like they’re not bored. (laughter)
THERAPIST: Yeah, there’s some days you feel like (inaudible at 0:13:03) for them, and (pause) critical of them, and anxious and guilty about that.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah. (pause) I think super intimidated also though. Like I just (pause) (sigh) yeah, yeah, it sort of feels like being in school again, and like I had a lot more resources to deal with feeling snubbed, but I definitely feel snubbed, even when I’m not actually being snubbed. ","P1-N400711":"[0:14:16] (pause) Yeah. (pause)
THERAPIST: I think you’re talking about feeling intimidated. Like at first I thought you maybe were like putting them up here, because it was like safer in a way than feeling unequal toward and being critical of them. But I actually, that’s something it’s not, it is more like (pause) ","P1-N400731":"like they have some stuff that you really don’t have. [0:15:29]
CLIENT: Yeah; self-assurance is what comes to mind. (laughter) (pause) Yeah. (pause) Also like (pause) there aren’t that many of Kim’s friends who I don’t feel like they’re patronizing me a little bit when they talk to me. It just [may be what it is.] (ph) And I’m supposed ","P1-N400751":"to vary between feeling like they’re right to be patronizing, and (sigh) feeling quite critical of them for it. [0:16:49] (pause)
THERAPIST: I guess you really don’t feel like much doing this job.
CLIENT: You know, not really. (pause) I mean – [0:18:53] (pause)
THERAPIST: I think sometimes you’re treated that way.
CLIENT: Yeah sometimes. Well, and in some ways, it makes it easy when people treat me that way, because then I can be like, “Well, fuck you; this is important work and it’s not easy.” And I do believe that it’s both important and not easy [in this job] (ph). (pause) I don’t ","P1-N400811":"know. I don’t – yeah, I just don’t talk about enough. [0:19:29] (pause)
THERAPIST: I can imagine for you to [establish a link] (ph) with, you know, like other things that you wanted to pan out [in grade school most obviously] (ph), but -
CLIENT: But teaching is hard.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I did apply to a lot of places last year.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I’m like, I don’t remember that time well enough to know what (inaudible at 0:20:08) is like, or why nothing worked. But I feel like it could be that (sigh) I just felt puffy; it could be that I just didn’t -
THERAPIST: I remember what you told me -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: remembered a few good things. One was (inaudible at 0:20:32) after sending about five resumes out, and not hearing good things back, you decided that like you were completely going about this entirely the wrong way. Now I’m teasing a little, but like it was a pretty small number of ","P1-N400931":"resumes, and you were sure that they’re not working out meant that like, you were really fucking the whole thing up.
CLIENT: Obviously that was [psycho thing] (ph). Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. You do things that like the independent school job market has just changed in the last five years.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah, that’s what I meant. But I can sort of figure that out, but it doesn’t – (sigh) (pause)
THERAPIST: That was the other thing I remember. (pause) I know it’s a job, but it’s a [angry issue] (ph) thing. So residential like a private school who just has like (audible at 0:21:59), so like an hour away from here.
CLIENT: With (school?) (sp?)
THERAPIST: (School) (sp?). That’s right, yeah.
CLIENT: Okay. I forgotten about it entirely until James reminded me when I [kind of was depressed] (ph) (inaudible at 0:22:10).
THERAPIST: I don’t remember why you didn’t get that one, but I remember you feeling -
CLIENT: I think I wasn’t the right – like it wasn’t my field; I was applying for like a history position or something.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I remember it being something that felt like kind of insulting or a little more like -
CLIENT: Yeah, I think, or what James said at least was that it was a history; it came down to me, and somebody with a history degree. And they said like, we going to (ditch) (ph) this person, please reapply, because like we’re interested in you. But, I don’t know. (pause) [0:23:10] (pause) (sigh)
THERAPIST: I know you’ve had a lot; you’ve worked very hard.
CLIENT: What’s that?
THERAPIST: You sent out a lot of resumes; that was very hard.
CLIENT: Yeah. (sigh) Yeah, I don’t – I don’t really want to that again right now.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) [0:24:10] (pause)
CLIENT: Man, I just feel like crap. (laughter) Candace said she’d (coughing) [ended up] (ph) going through this program at University of Maryland; it’s like a post-master’s program, but it’s like a – it has some certificate or something, but it’s like a three-year ","P1-N400BB1":"summer program. But it’s for people who already have a master’s degree, and are like working toward like a spiritual direction or a ministry.
THERAPIST: If you’re not a failure, does that make a lot of this so sad? [0:28:41] (pause)
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I hope there could be a reason. (pause) (crying) [0:29:41]-[0:30:41] (pause) I’m (inaudible at 0:31:36). I slept a lot this week; I’m still tired. I just don’t want to be tired. (pause) I hate saying that; it sounds really (white noise) (inaudible at 0:31:59). (pause) (sigh)
THERAPIST: Why did you want to shut it down, you know? Was it for like leaving Denver? Or for not wanting to move out there? Or -
CLIENT: I think it was like, I felt well, there’s no way I could do this, even though I felt like, there’s no way that I could like spend time with James, or there’s no way that I could take time off of work, and just knowing my life would be in this place where I could do it at that ","P1-N400D11":"point, and if I like think too hard about not being able to do this thing that I want, then I will just be heartbroken. (pause) I do have to actually see if I can do it first. [0:35:38]
THERAPIST: I see. (pause)
CLIENT: It’s funny, I don’t think that much about like what you can tell from my manner or not. I guess I always sort of assumed that like when things are really, it’s like screaming in here when I’m quiet. And when I’m moderately bad, it’s like shouting. But I guess ","P1-N400D51":"it’s not necessarily (chuckle) the case. [0:36:40] (pause)
THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess (pause) (coughing) (inaudible at 0:37:18), I can’t I mean at the moment (pause) like (pause) (inaudible at 0:37:34). And I had a sense that it’s overwhelming, and painful, and you’re picking your way fairly carefully around what you can and cannot sort of think ","P1-N400D71":"about – about it. But I don’t have the sense that things are really really bad.
CLIENT: No. (pause) [0:38:34]-[0:39:34] (pause)
THERAPIST: I imagine part of what this – part of the way this goes [I’m listing] (ph) is that mostly you seem very sad; like you sort of I think mostly move more towards feeling like sad, or you mentioned you know, you’d be heartbroken. Which I think is probably scarier than focusing ","P1-N400DB1":"on the part where you feel like a failure. (pause)
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [0:40:34] (pause)
THERAPIST: Probably partly, and I think about it, because (pause) think that rather than like a failure, (although) (ph) it may seem a little closer to me. [0:41:40] (pause)
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I think that (pause) it felt right there, is that I was asking you for something, but without realizing that I was, or wanting to, and that you gave it to me anyway, and that was really scary. I think that was really scary, so (inaudible at 0:42:46). (laughter)
THERAPIST: Got you. (pause)
CLIENT: (sigh) (pause)
THERAPIST: Well we should stop.
CLIENT: Okay. Yeah.
