DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her feelings for her therapist and sex.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [Silence from 00:00:04 to 00:00:29]
CLIENT: ...But when it was, it was pretty nice (pause) and very different.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: I think the things that were (pauses) that were contributing to my (pause) not liking focusing and accepting those things are (pause) not liking and accepting (pause) such intense and repetitive feelings about you. (Pause) Or I fear like, related to the fear that I (pause) am going to lose my mind...
THERAPIST: Hm.
CLIENT: ...Like, then I'm going to become crazy.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: And, like, some sense of what an a normally functioning mind with control over her thoughts and feelings looks like and what does and what doesn't fit. [00:02:05]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So I think (pause) part of the amazingness about medication is it is an opportunity to retrain and [inaudible at 00:02:26] gives you an opportunity to retrain or readjust [both things] (ph).
THERAPIST: Yeah, my impression is different. It is that (pause) it is the things that are (pause) difficult to bear, usually, for reasons that aren't clear, that, um, (pause) won't dissolve. [00:03:13]
CLIENT: Um, yeah. (pause) I think there is also a...
THERAPIST: Oh, [everything there] (ph)...
CLIENT: There is also some aspect of repetition and revolution (ph) that needs to be a symptom of...
THERAPIST: Hm.
CLIENT: ...My mind right now. So it is not necessarily that it is, like, so scary that I [can't bear it] (ph). [00:04:00]
THERAPIST: Hm.
CLIENT: ...I want (pause) there is, like, nothing I don't want.
CLIENT: Do you [feel it] [ph]?
THERAPIST: Um, [shifts in seat] (pause)... [00:06:00]
THERAPIST: When I look at (pause) imagine I don't know that in a question like although [there is a text of] [ph] (pause) how much are we on the same page, like how much is there on that [you think is already in place] [ph]. [00:07:00]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm, and like (pause) how much can I get away with not explaining.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: It is hard to explain. (Pause)
CLIENT: Is that wrong [ph]?
THERAPIST: I (pause) I think you wanted to be eased [ph] in it could [rate as the higher of all of them] [ph].
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. (Pause) And dealing with it is not happening dealing with the bad kind of [inaudible at 00:08:46].
THERAPIST: Uh-huh, yeah.
CLIENT: Or not being able to see it the way that much of it is happening, and focusing on [less energy] [ph].
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
THERAPIST: I meant sorry not being able to deal not being able to see the way that it is happening?
CLIENT: Or, like, (pause)...
THERAPIST: Not knowing to the extent to which it is happening?
CLIENT: Yeah, and and (pause) that not being enough.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (Pause)
CLIENT: But I think (pause) I think of it is sexual and some of it is not at all.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So it pretty much, um, (pause) started [falling down] [ph] with that this weekend, and (pause) so I had to excuse myself and cry, but I saw [him differently] [ph]. Jeremy didn't really know what was going on. And then [inaudible at 00:11:10] [00:11:10]
THERAPIST: How are you guessing [ph] than that? I mean, I'm not like, in a way, but (pause) [kind of sad] [ph].
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. It was sad. (Pause) It was also interesting. I think I was crying because (pause) it was so easy to imagine having sex with you and (pause) it was so easy to be having sex with Jeremy, and both things just became one thing and it was completely confusing and overwhelming, and very sad. ","P1-N4007D1":"(Pause) And yet it was also like liberating. [00:12:32]
THERAPIST: Because that is sort of (pause) uh, (pause) I'm trying to say, like, those are [contained paths] [ph] that you're already doing?
CLIENT: Yeah, and there is so much that doesn't get captured in words then, but (pause) gets captured quite nicely during sex (pause) or (pause) physical contact.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So it was like I was able to have that experience. (Pause) I was able to get a lot closer to experience that experience than than...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, [inaudible at 00:13:35]?
CLIENT: ...Than talking about it hear and thinking about it.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Second [ph] is a very direct experience of (pause) or not being said or experienced.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: ...That he sort of alluded to [his words] [ph] here. [00:14:07]
CLIENT: And it was a very direct experience of the way in which I want to be together and how I can't [ph]. (Pause) It was kind of like the closest I'm going to get or something.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause)
CLIENT: Is this at all conflicting for you? [00:15:00]
THERAPIST: How so?
CLIENT: Um, (pause for 18 seconds) like what you want to do and what you will do, (pause) or are doing and can do?
THERAPIST: Sure. Um, (pause for 12 seconds) I mean, (pause) like a simple example would be that (pause)...
CLIENT: You know, the...
THERAPIST: Certainly, things I want to do like to be reassuring and supportive, and affectionate, that to kind of help you with pain that you're feeling now, though I (pause) don't think it would sort of ultimately be very helpful. [00:17:28]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: Or, you know, (pause) ways that I feel bad for some of the painful things that you're feeling but can't (pause) uh, sort of (pause) help with, (pause) you know, in a kind of immediate way (pause) by... [00:18:40]
CLIENT: OK.
THERAPIST: ...Being reassuring and supportive.
CLIENT: I don't know. (Pause)
THERAPIST: I'm not I imagine there is another part to the question that I didn't really answer, but, you know, (pause) am I conflicted in around, like, you know, what the boundaries are and the rules [ph] that I am to follow? [00:20:01]
CLIENT: It is not so much about whether you think the boundaries should be there or whether you're going to follow them but (pause) there is like a part of (pause) my experience is if somebody (pause) knows that somebody else wants to have sex with them, (pause) that is a pretty provocative very ","P1-N400C71":"evocative opportunity [ph] position to be in, to be seen like. [00:21:12]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...To be seen [inaudible at 00:21:18] that you aren't in that position.
THERAPIST: Of being like stirred up in some way or...?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm just not really [with you] [ph] to (pause)...
CLIENT: How you did that [inaudible at 00:23:13] (pause) [inaudible at 00:23:21].
THERAPIST: Mm.
THERAPIST: Do you feel uncomfortable?
CLIENT: No. (Pause) I feel private.
THERAPIST: Mm. [00:24:00]
CLIENT: But I also feel like I want to share those [kinds of] [ph]...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Like, it is so easy to imagine being with you in some way. Why is that? Why can't I sort of seamlessly or (pause) it is not effortless but, like, why can't I go between having you inside me and having Jeremy inside of me? It feels like (pause) just [don't think] [ph] it should take more effort ","P1-N400ED1":"in having [ph]... [00:25:12]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: You said that was maybe there is another way in which it is very much like I am inside of you.
CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) [00:26:00]
CLIENT: Not just your penis but like your whole being.
CLIENT: But I want to be inside of you. (Pause)
CLIENT: I've dreamt about (pause) where you shared some stuff with me. [Clears throat] (pause) in my dream, when you gave me your tickets to the Wizard of Oz (pause) and told me that you'd really enjoyed spending time with me, and that you were going to be off [three months to a year] [ph] because ","P1-N401011":"your best friend had died while having [systemic infection] [ph]. (Pause) [00:27:43]
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] (Pause) Well, I have very much enjoyed spending time with you; that much is clearly true.
CLIENT: Thanks.
THERAPIST: Um...
CLIENT: That is what you said (pause) in your [ph] dream. [00:28:08]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: (Pause) I [would hear it] [ph]. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Well, I'm not there yet. Um, (pause) but I'm working on the Wizard of Oz thing and the [inaudible at 00:28:45] months because my best friend died or [inaudible at 00:28:53]. Um...
CLIENT: Oh, and the Wizard of Oz showing [clears throat] was at 1 a.m., and that is why you couldn't go. [00:29:03]
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: And my parents lived with me in my apartment, and were very concerned at going out alone [for me] [ph]. (Pause)
THERAPIST: You have the visions [ph] to either of those, [to any of that, uh]...?
CLIENT: No. (Pause)
THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:29:45]
CLIENT: I guess I feel like I could understand (pause) you [when you're loud] [ph]. (Pause)
