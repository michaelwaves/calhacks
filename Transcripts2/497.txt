TITLE: Client "Ju", Session April 08, 2014: Client discusses difficulties at work with their supervisor, mentor, and work responsibilities.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses difficulties at work with their supervisor, mentor, and work responsibilities.
CLIENT: Well, I’m really ouch-y because (ph) I broke into my apartment this morning. (crosstalk at 00:00:45)
THERAPIST: You’re really ouch-y?
CLIENT: Yeah. I crawled through a window, basically doing a handstand to get back into my apartment.
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: Because I left my wallet and keys inside.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: In retrospect –
THERAPIST: Kind of Jackie Chan, right there. [00:01:02]
CLIENT: Yeah. It was. In retrospect, I really should’ve just called my landlord. But I had just called him the day before. And I don’t know. I wasn’t thinking very (chuckles) well (ph). Yeah. It was a crazy, Jackie Chan move. And no one called the police, so . . .
THERAPIST: Well, that part’s good.
CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: Yeah. But I’m definitely—about an hour—when I first did it, I was like, “Oh, I’m fine.” And an hour later, I’m old.
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: (chuckles) I should not have done that. So, super-frustratingly, I found out last week that the paperwork from Dr. Gerrard for me to get FMLA disappeared into the ether.
THERAPIST: Oh, no.
CLIENT: And it’d been needed (ph) for about a month. [00:02:00] I just assumed she sent the fax, the paperwork directly to the –
THERAPIST: Sorry. This is FMLA from when?
CLIENT: For now-ish.
THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:02:13)
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:02:14) started in early—mid-February. For (sighs) needing some time off to deal with ongoing medication change problems.
THERAPIST: Had you told me? I didn’t even know about it.
CLIENT: I don’t know.
THERAPIST: Maybe I don’t remember. I don’t remember that. Anyway.
CLIENT: And I’ve been really wanting—I need to use FMLA a lot (crosstalk at 00:02:35). And then, I e-mailed, anticipating (ph) they’d be like, “Hey, what’s up?” And they’re just like, “Yeah, you—well, your doctor hasn’t sent anything in.” ","P1-N4003B1":"So, (chuckles) I just saw her last week. And she’s like, “Okay. I don’t know what happened. Here’s the hard copy.” And then, Friday, I was talking to the disability office. And they—well, basically, like, “Oh, so, how much FMLA have you already taken?” ","P1-N4003B2":"[00:03:02] I’m like, “But I thought I couldn’t do that until you said so.”
THERAPIST: Wait. Sorry. Couldn’t do?
CLIENT: So, the disability office asked me what—[had already started] (ph) a reduced schedule, had already taken FMLA time.
THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:03:19) I get it. Right. And you’re like, “What?”
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: It’s a complete mess. If I had known that, it would’ve been a lot happier. So, I ended up going home in a really cranky rage fit, because I was just really frustrated. I just want to not be crazy at work like this.
THERAPIST: It’s just going to roll out.
CLIENT: Yeah. Which was super frustrating and upsetting, because everything basically—I’m like, “What does it do? Do you even know what it does? Is this something that we could solve?” [00:07:16] And (inaudible at 00:07:17) like, “What?”
THERAPIST: So, you’re saying the only thing you know about it, basically, is that you’re going to be supporting it?
CLIENT: Yeah. And the suggestion to have a pilot was negged. Someone else was like, “Oh, you can come over to the dental school or whatever to check out our implementation.” And the answer was, “No, no. We should just buy it. And sell it.”
THERAPIST: The dental school’s by the medical school, right?
CLIENT: Yeah. You just take the M2 shuttle.
THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:08:06), yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. For free. Yeah. I mean, it takes a while. But whatever. It’s right there. So, yeah, what I know about it basically is that I get to support it. And that’s about it. And then, maybe a 3D printer in Aurora. Because another one of (inaudible at 00:08:33) libraries, it’s ","P1-N400611":"getting one. They’re not, however, currently planning to buy the software that allows you to make your own 3D objects to print.
THERAPIST: (laughs)
CLIENT: (chuckles) That wasn’t part of the plan. Fortunately, one of my coworkers was like, “You know, you have to buy the thing that lets you do it.” [00:09:00] So, if (inaudible at 00:09:04) about the unknown. And then, also e-mail from Christy (inaudible at 00:09:12), who’s ","P1-N400651":"one of the senior managers, about some interesting workshops at (inaudible at 00:09:19), at a local conference.
THERAPIST: That’s going to what?
CLIENT: It’s going into one of the main rooms that I support. Which I didn’t know about. [00:11:00] (sighs)
THERAPIST: But actually, I did. Yeah.
CLIENT: And this weird, “But it’s not possible that he could be”—or that people—I get that it doesn’t make any sense. And it’s not helpful. And stupid. And (inaudible at 00:13:43). But it’s still happening.
THERAPIST: Kind of insulting. Yeah (ph).
CLIENT: It was insulting. In parts, I’m like, “So, it’s true that you often see me in jeans and a tee shirt. I have to crawl around on the regular. I never know when.” And my first response really was, “Can I direct you to the articles that I publish on this topic?” ","P1-N4007F1":"Of (crosstalk at 00:14:40). Yes. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I’m not really doubting you. I’m just (crosstalk at 00:14:45) –
CLIENT: Yeah. I was like, “I have a published body of work on the topic of how clothing, your (inaudible at 00:14:52) appearance does indeed affect how people react to you.” And that sucks. [00:15:00] In particular, an article that was why—respectability politics and why it’s ","P1-N400831":"really rare. I may be dressed very casually, but it’s really hard for me to dress crazy sloppy, because, in my head, it’s like my dad and all my relatives being like, “You can’t go out of the house like that because what people will think. You need to dress well so white people ","P1-N400832":"don’t think that black people are ignorant,” or whatever ever.
THERAPIST: Yeah. It’s casual. It’s not messy.
CLIENT: Yeah. And also, it’s not—every (ph) part of me is like, “Where are we going with this?” Because my mentor’s a very put-together, mildly conservative-dressed woman. Very nice. She works at the business school, where you have to look like that. And I’m just ","P1-N400891":"like, “I’m not sure this is going to overcome”—if I decided to wear a nice dress and pumps. Or make-up or whatever to work every day. Don’t think that’s really going to help with systemic problems.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:17:38) about it.
CLIENT: Yeah. I was like, “I publish things in books. And a variety of other pieces. And I’m not going to bring that up, probably, because I think (chuckles) it would be—it would come off needlessly hostile.” [00:18:00]
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: (sighs) Because, well, it’s just my in-my-head response is basically, “I’d like to refer you to my published body of work.”
THERAPIST: I believe that if you had, it would—it is quite hostile. (chuckles)
CLIENT: (chuckles) So, that is not—so, there’s—I don’t know if it’s hostile, but I am very—I’m pretty sure that she’s not interested in a discussion about (inaudible at 00:18:47) politics. I’m pretty sure that she is deeply into or supportive of ","P1-N400991":"respectability. [00:19:00] (inaudible at 00:19:00) you have to dress respectively at all times. (inaudible at 00:19:04) that’s how she seems to dress, which is totally fine.
THERAPIST: I imagine it would be helpful to have a mentor who also has some similar (inaudible at 00:21:06) views.
CLIENT: Yeah. Or not even similar, just—she doesn’t—I find her very hard to read. And I don’t know that—I’m sure she has personal and political views. I just have no idea what they are. Generally speaking, I’m just like, “I don’t know.”
THERAPIST: I mean, she seems pretty buttoned up at work.
CLIENT: She’s super buttoned (ph) up. She’s not great with small talk. She likes the little—she likes an agenda or a plan for your discussion. [00:22:00]
THERAPIST: I think (inaudible at 00:22:06) her actually being engaged with you. I mean, she sounds interested. And like she wants to help. But I don’t know how she responded to some of the stuff that you were describing, about Chet and whomever else. I mean, it sounds like she wasn’t taking ","P1-N400A71":"in all that well where you were coming from. And was –
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: patronizing, in various ways, across the things she said and suggested. It doesn’t sound like mal-intent, but certainly, for not having a sense of you.
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:23:01] She flat out did not respond to anything I said to Will (inaudible at 00:23:07). Just has never responded.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Does she know him?
CLIENT: Yeah. He works there.
THERAPIST: He’s at the business school, now, right?
CLIENT: Yeah. He works there. So, she knows him. We actually (inaudible at 00:23:20) over having lunch. (inaudible at 00:23:24) I feel a little—very awkward for us. Like, “Heh. I hate you.” The pleasant, “I hate you,” “I hate you, too. How are you doing?”
THERAPIST: “Now you’re starting to get it.”
CLIENT: “That is how I feel, as well.” And she also wasn’t aware of the lack of support that I get. I mean, I thought I told her, but she was surprised to hear that I probably—I needed to take a personal day or vacation day to attend this professional conference, because I’m ","P1-N400BB1":"not a professional employee. She didn’t know they didn’t have professional development funds. And a bunch of other things. It was like, “Yeah. I’m not a librarian, actually. I’m not a professional employee.” [00:25:00]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Which (inaudible at 00:25:43) for your talk—(inaudible at 00:25:44) your talk.
CLIENT: The topic (sighs) is (inaudible at 00:25:46) speaking about whole libarianship, which is bringing your whole self to libarianship. And taking things that you’ve learned from other parts of your life into your work. [00:26:03] Or asking work to consider things you do that aren’t technically ","P1-N400C31":"librarian-y to be considered as professional development.
THERAPIST: Right. [There’s gayness on it] (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah. And also, some of the stuff, I’m just like, “I would like to discuss the mass amount of organizing I’ve done with (inaudible at 00:28:25), but I really hope that discussing a (inaudible at 00:28:27) group right now.” (chuckles)
THERAPIST: (laughs)
CLIENT: astounding levels. Really astounding. And things we worry about include it’s really important that we can find one meal option is vegan. And –
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: another one is gluten free. And another one is this. And it’s just like, “Ugh.”
THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:29:29)
CLIENT: “I hate you all.” But then again, I’m doing that. I feel like I can organize anyone. I don’t care. But that, it’s hard to explain.
THERAPIST: Well, you’re describing her as being useless (inaudible at 00:29:57) counter-productive. [00:30:00] I think.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t feel like I’ve –
THERAPIST: As a mentor, I should say. (crosstalk at 00:30:05) –
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: not necessarily like as somebody to chat with a little bit. But as someone who—I mean, you (inaudible at 00:30:14) have not mentioned anything of value she’s said to you regarding the sorts of things you wanted a mentor for help with, I think.
CLIENT: Yes. And she doesn’t really understand what I—my job is. Which is a problem. When she saw (inaudible at 00:30:43), like, “Oh, I have to introduce you to someone who does blah, blah, blah.” I’m like, “Yeah. I already do that. That’s my job.” Or ","P1-N400E91":"it’s like, “Yeah. That’s someone I can reach out to by virtue of”—she’s—I feel like I’m not getting introductions that are really—(inaudible at 00:31:12) useful to me. [00:31:14] That’s a nice thing, that, but I don’t really want to talk ","P1-N400E92":"to someone about [an implementation] (ph) of a mediascape table when I already did that. I’m like, A), I hate it, and B), I actually set that up. (chuckles) “And the person that I—that you want me to talk to is someone who didn’t.” I don’t know. Talking to a librarian ","P1-N400E93":"who has used it is not that interesting to me, because—I don’t know.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I would think probably you have a bottom ten list of things you want to—work topics you wanted to talk more with people about. [00:32:00] I would have to imagine media:scape tables would be on there somewhere.
CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Yeah. And, I mean, as it turns out, I think one of my friends’ business (inaudible at 00:32:13) school is probably someone who I would be better off talking about technology. If I wanted to. [Which I] (ph) don’t actually want to, but –
THERAPIST: So, I would imagine you’re annoyed by this whole mentor thing.
CLIENT: I am.
THERAPIST: I mean, it’s been a real disappointment.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And frustrating.
CLIENT: (sighs) We’re doing (inaudible at 00:32:42) tomorrow morning. We’re doing a twoor three-hour shebang. It’s not end-of-program thing, I don’t think. If it’s not end-of-program, (inaudible at 00:32:56) it’s one step away from it. [00:33:00] All I actually ","P1-N400F91":"want to talk about to the program people is based on the sexism in the workplace. And I don’t know if I feel capable of doing that. Or capable of dealing with reactions to that. And I don’t want to bring it up (inaudible at 00:33:43) I don’t (inaudible at 00:33:45) feel comfortable ","P1-N400F92":"bringing it up with my—the mentee group as a whole, because A), it’s mostly white people, B), I just sense a lot of defensiveness already from interactions and (inaudible at 00:34:01). [00:34:02] I don’t know if (inaudible at 00:34:04) anyone else is—wants to talk about.
CLIENT: And, for me, part of why, like I said, I just need to leave Manchester is—I just—I really feel like I would have to completely leave the Manchester library system to be able to do anything. [00:35:03] And maybe I’d be better off using whatever Harvard prestige, wink, wink, ","P1-N400FF1":"wink, somewhere else. I don’t know. Cal Tech, Leslie (sp?), wherever.
THERAPIST: The change jobs part, you mean?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. When are you anticipating moving?
CLIENT: I don’t really have any timeline (inaudible at 00:35:55)—I finish my degree in December. [00:36:00] And then, I anticipate wanting to face plant for a while. And then, start looking.
THERAPIST: At least a year.
CLIENT: At least a year. Yeah. And I also (inaudible at 00:36:16) I don’t know how long that job search would (ph) take. Or any (inaudible at 00:36:23). But realistically, I (inaudible at 00:36:25) for a year. And ideally, I would be feeling a little more emotionally stable. (chuckles) I would hope.
THERAPIST: Sure. And I don’t have an answer. (inaudible at 00:36:42) other part [of what’s tricky] (ph) is that (inaudible at 00:36:48) work is one of the things that has been very difficult emotionally –
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: to deal with. [00:37:00]
CLIENT: Yes. I don’t know. I mean, yeah, work is that thing that—I’m not feeling great for a variety of reasons. But the things that set me off and crying or feeling super defeated have all been—not all of—mostly been work stuff. So, there’s that. I’m not sure ","P1-N401151":"that I can find a way to have Paul not be my manager. Or to work in different space. Or a bazillion things. [00:38:03]
THERAPIST: I don’t recall, in any conversation I can remember you telling me about, in which you brought something up that mattered to you to somebody at work. Or asked for something that mattered to you at work. [00:39:03] That you got what you wanted. But moreover, felt like you were particularly ","P1-N401191":"well understood.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Haven’t brought it up in the first place. At all. I mean, I’m just—I’m seconding what you’re saying, I guess.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But I’m sure—I—maybe I—I can imagine I might hear a—there may have been some conversations that didn’t go as badly as most of the ones I’ve heard about. But, understandably, you didn’t tell me about those, because –
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: we talk about things that (inaudible at 00:39:56). But yeah. [00:40:01]
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I’m (inaudible at 00:40:15) like, “Do I try up the chain again? Is that going to go nowhere? Probably. Should I try”—thinking about—try and think of other ways to (sighs) I don’t know. I feel like half—I’m just being—I’m ","P1-N401271":"being defeatist. Maybe there is a way I could talk to someone. And they would actually listen. But then, I think, “No. I’m pretty sure that that’s not going to happen. But hmm.” [00:41:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah. I don’t think you’re being defeatist. Nor do I think that it’s how you’re talking to people that’s the problem. I do wonder why you’re doubting yourself in those ways. Having (inaudible at 00:41:23) within so many conversations that have not gone ","P1-N401291":"that way. Do you know what I mean? It seems like more of—much more of a no-brainer to me than to you. (inaudible at 00:41:42) I have the sense that (inaudible at 00:41:47) has . . .
THERAPIST: . . . you don’t want to feel like you’re being negative. Or (inaudible at 00:42:09) upsetting (inaudible at 00:42:09) has been. Something like that. I’m sure.
CLIENT: I think the other—one of the reasons why I doubt myself is—yeah. I don’t get a lot of affirmation when I talk to people about it. I get what I was getting from my mentor, like, “Oh, but that can’t be possible.” Or, “You should go fight that and talk ","P1-N401311":"to someone else.” And I’m like, “Cool story. Already tried that. I’m out of people to talk to.” [00:43:04]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:44:07) with me.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Right? (inaudible at 00:44:12)
CLIENT: (sighs)
THERAPIST: We should stop, for now.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:44:25) next week.
CLIENT: Yep.
