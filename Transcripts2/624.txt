TITLE: Client "B", Session February 26, 2014: Client discusses feeling like a failure at work as work performance reviews approach.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses feeling like a failure at work as work performance reviews approach.
CLIENT: Hi. (sighs) Performance reviews at work are today and I’m terrified because I know my performance has been terrible. (sighs) I continue to have a hard time focusing at work. That sucks. (long pause) [00:01:14]
THERAPIST: Do you expect to take a beating?
CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause)
THERAPIST: Which, I guess, you feel you pretty well deserve?
CLIENT: Um-hum. [00:01:55] (pause)
THERAPIST: You’re pretty anxious because it’s really going to hurt and it’s going to make you feel terribly ashamed.
CLIENT: Yep. (pause)
THERAPIST: There’s really nothing you can do and no way you can protect yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah. And, in fact, it is like justly-earned punishment having been a fuck-up.
THERAPIST: I see. [00:02:52] (long pause) [00:04:14] What’s coming to your mind?
CLIENT: (sigh) It’s crazy, but I’m kind of bored with thinking about him. I would prefer him not to be the first thing that comes to mind all the time. (long pause) [00:05:11] He hasn’t spoken to me since his birthday party and, even at his birthday party, he barely spoke to me. (pause)
THERAPIST: Ouch.
CLIENT: Yep. (long pause) [00:06:49]
THERAPIST: I guess I’m wondering a little bit if you want me to try to either cheer you up or be critical – not because you anticipate it would work if I tried to cheer you up or be critical, but more because then we’d be kind of at odds, which would be no fun, but more pleasant than ","P1-N400251":"your dread of the review and upset about Tracy.
CLIENT: True. (long pause) (sighs) [00:08:20] I was in Montana last weekend visiting Lo and I joked that for a month this year I was giving up thinking about people who make me feel sad. (sniffles) It’s like the pink elephants; the more I try not to think about them, the more I end up thinking ","P1-N400271":"about them. (pause) [00:09:14] I also discovered this morning that I completely fucked-up a thing with the press, that is actually time sensitive and now I’m kicking myself over that. I ordered paper back in October for a chat book that I ended up not publishing because the whole situation with ","P1-N400272":"Penelope – which I don’t really want to recount everything that happened – but one of the consequences was that the chat book didn’t happen. So I never opened the giant, 20-pound box of paper. I popped it open this morning and realized that I had ordered cover instead of paper, ","P1-N400273":"so I have 900 sheets of cover stock and no paper to print the insides of the book on. [00:10:00] I need to start printing this weekend for the book, the anthology that I’m editing. Oops. I don’t know what I’m going to do with 900 sheets of cream cover stock. (long pause) [00:11:12]
THERAPIST: You’re probably going to tell me this is a stretch, but what that makes me think of is that you feel like, in a way, you have more available for, as I was talking about a minute ago, doing things to dodge or cover over the things that you’re feeling really upset about. [00:12:03] ","P1-N400291":"But when it comes to actually feeling how upset you are or what is on the inside, you feel like you don’t really have much of anything available to do that.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) (crying) [00:13:14]
THERAPIST: And I guess I wonder whether there is some way this also feels time-sensitive, whether you feel like you are, in some ways or somehow, running out of time to deal with these things, like items with the performance review today or because you really feel like you should be done thinking about ","P1-N4002D1":"Thomas or for some other reason.
CLIENT: But that’s [ ] (inaudible at 00:13:38). I just (pause) . . . There are a lot of things where I feel like I’ve fucked-up or am in the process of fucking up. [00:14:01] I haven’t kept in communication with the students I’m allegedly advising at Boston University. That’s ","P1-N4002F1":"actually a really poor fit for my skill set and I really do need to just e-mail the director and say, “I’m sorry. I can’t do this,” and resign. That would be the most honest thing to do at this point, but I’ve been putting off writing that e-mail for weeks. I feel really ","P1-N4002F2":"bad about that. (pause) (sigh) I was at my friend, Matilda’s house probably about three weeks ago. Matilda asked me to tell her the whole story of what happened with Thomas because she was really confused because she thought we were really good together; and so I told her everything, including ","P1-N4002F3":"the whole “I poured my heart out and tell him I’m in love with him and ask how he feels about me and his response is ‘Well, you’re good in bed,’” which is . . . [00:15:01]
THERAPIST: Horrible
CLIENT: Completely unacceptable. And I didn’t realize this, but Matilda’s roommate was in the other room and could hear it, could hear the whole conversation; and Matilda’s roommate, Paige, also used to date Thomas. So Paige came out and was like, “Forgive me for eavesdropping. ","P1-N400331":"I couldn’t help myself, but having dated Thomas myself, all of this sounds really familiar and he’s just really terrible at understanding that other people have emotional needs.” Like – yeah. (pause) Even knowing all that, even knowing that he is a terrible partner and his responses ","P1-N400332":"to serious conversations were totally unacceptable, I’m still worried that I made the wrong decision – that maybe I could have tried harder and done more, which is crazy. [00:16:04] Both parties in a relationship should be trying to make it work, but still . . . And he clearly wasn’t ","P1-N400333":"trying or, if he was, his trying was completely ineffectual. Bah humbug. (pause) It makes no sense for me to continue to be hung up on him; none whatsoever. [00:16:59]
THERAPIST: I don’t know. In light of the other things we’re talking about, there are various ways it’s familiar and, I suspect, comfortable. He’s impossible. This may seem a little silly about it, like you’re stuck between an unstoppable force, which is your need – ","P1-N400351":"and understandably so – for the person that you’re with to care about how you’re feeling; listen to what matters to you; respond with care and affection; be considerate of your feelings. [00:18:07] That’s the unstoppable force. And the immovable object, which is Thomas, is none ","P1-N400352":"of those things and cannot be moved to do that. (both chuckle) I think for you that’s a very familiar position.
CLIENT: Sure. Yeah.
THERAPIST: At work, for example, the unstoppable force would be your need to get work done, to do well, to use your talents, to show people you did a good job and have them appreciate you – stuff like that – and the immovable object would be how you get stuck and shut down, how hard that ","P1-N400391":"is to penetrate or soften. [00:19:13] Do you know what I mean?
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: There are other examples, but I think that’s familiar about Thomas. [00:19:44] I guess my thought is it’s a little bit like the dynamic I was mentioning before where actually, if I sort of don’t try to push back about how you feel or make you feel better, or on the other ","P1-N4003D1":"side, like I’m critical of how you’re approaching things or something, in a way, stuff actually hurts more – not because in a way it actually makes things worse, but because then you’re there with things that feel very painful. [00:20:34] I’m not saying the alternative ","P1-N4003D2":"feels all that great, either. Clearly it does not, but I think that’s one aspect I think of things, for example, with Thomas. There is a kind of frustration and stuck-ness and shame, which feels terrible. I’m not saying it’s a wonderful alternative, but I think it’s familiar ","P1-N4003D3":"and, in some ways, maybe feels less anxious or safer. [00:21:12] I’m also not saying I think this is the only thing that [drew you] (ph?) to Thomas. I don’t think that, but it does seem to me probably relevant. (long pause) [00:22:11] I would imagine that it may also be the quality here, ","P1-N4003D4":"but I think elsewhere at times – what was the name of the woman who was eavesdropping?
CLIENT: Paige.
THERAPIST: Paige. I’m sort of speculating here. You didn’t really say, but my guess is that, on the one hand, it was a relief to hear what she said about how familiar that was. On the other hand, I expect it was a little disconcerting at first to know that she heard.
CLIENT: A little bit.
THERAPIST: Not so much. (pause) [00:23:00] I guess my thought was that part of what was uncomfortable about having somebody right there with you, with what you went through or what you felt, felt a little close, a little like – whoa, not what I planned; but of course, also that she was supportive, ","P1-N400451":"very nice. (long pause) [00:24:33] What’s on your mind? (pause)
CLIENT: A serious paper sizing. The giant box of cover stock that I don’t know what to do with is A series; it’s A4.
THERAPIST: Which is like 8½” x 11”?
CLIENT: It’s slightly off from that. [00:24:59] It’s 8.25” x 11.8”. The [Perdition] (ph?) Club wanted to have letter-sized paper, but the nice thing about A series sizing is that, if you cut it in half, you get the next size down. The ratios are the same. So A4 is exactly double ","P1-N4004B1":"the size of A5, which is exactly double the size of A6, et cetera.
THERAPIST: It has a logarithm?
CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. But the print shop uses baronial sizes, which are not nearly as nice. A series is a metric 5; baronial is using British imperial units. They don’t line up. So I have the thought that maybe I could recoup some of my losses and sell the paper to the print shop, but they’re ","P1-N4004F1":"not going to be able to use it because they work in [bar] (ph?) mostly. I mean, they could use it theoretically, but that’s like I cut it down to A5; that’s 1,800 sheets and that’s kind of a lot. [00:26:02] (sighs) I feel like an idiot. (pause) I also got distracted trying to work ","P1-N4004F2":"out what my ratio of [side links] (ph?) would have to be for that doubling to work; 3:2 is the ratio. [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:53) maybe. I know there is the square root of two in there.
THERAPIST: If the area is doubled for each one, I think it is 4:2, isn’t it?
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: 3:1 the other way?
CLIENT: Yep. Easily distracted. Thinking about numbers is a much easier than thinking about feelings.
THERAPIST: Sure. I think distracted – another word for it is coping, for what it’s worth. (long pause) [00:29:00]
CLIENT: I really don’t want to go to work. I really don’t want to go to my performance review.
THERAPIST: When is this?
CLIENT: 3:00. I have a meeting at 11:00, at which I’m supposed to present a presentation that I have not worked on at all because I thought it was next week. I didn’t realize until yesterday that it was today, that all of yesterday I needed to focus on my presentation at 1:00, which I only ","P1-N4005F1":"barely have pulled together. I don’t know what I’m going to do at 11:00. (sniffles) By the time I get to work, I’ll have about 35 minutes. I could throw together four or five PowerPoint slides. They’ll be terrible but . . . (sighs) Yeah. It sucks, basically.
THERAPIST: I see. [00:30:00] (long pause) [00:33:23]
THERAPIST: I guess you’re feeling a little bit like the dream that many people have about showing up for, as adults, like the big exam in high school without having studied or without their clothes on, ten minutes late.
CLIENT: Except for me, that’s real because I’m totally unprepared and a fuck-up.
THERAPIST: Up to the part where you referred to yourself as a fuck-up, that’s what I meant. It sounds like it feels like that, except in real life. [00:34:00]
CLIENT: Yep. (pause)
THERAPIST: I would imagine here, too, to some extent, laying all this out. Here I am, a fuck-up, fucking all these things up.
CLIENT: Yep. It sucks.
THERAPIST: Yeah. We should stop for now.
