TITLE: Client "R", Session January 23, 2014: Client discusses meditation, gurus, and transference and counter-transferenceness in relationships.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses meditation, gurus, and transference and counter-transferenceness in relationships.
THERAPIST: Hi.
CLIENT: Hi. Yes?
THERAPIST: So, scheduling. I’m out Monday. (pause) I could meet Tuesday at 10 or Wednesday at 10:45 or 12.
CLIENT: Can I let you know today, later? Or tomorrow?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Okay. Tuesday at 10, Wednesday at 10:45 or 12.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Okay. (pause) Cool. (very long pause)
THERAPIST: I guess you sense that they don’t. (long pause)
CLIENT: In a way. (long pause) In a way, it’s nice to think that someone else could. (pause) Because then (pause) I think I would have another friend [in it]. (long pause)
THERAPIST: Hmm. (long pause)
CLIENT: My grandfather is really hungry for more (pause) dharma, more guidance, more teachings, more peace. And he’s excited. (pause) Like he’s discovered (pause) this beautiful field of wildflowers or something inside him. (pause)
THERAPIST: About what happened to her parents?
CLIENT: Yeah, and like what I told you about it.
THERAPIST: I think I remember pretty clearly.
CLIENT: Okay. (pause)
THERAPIST: About her (pause) One of them had just died recently and the other was staying with her.
CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.
THERAPIST: And she was sort of doing hospice. She took a break and came to deepsa [ph] class and had a feeling I don’t remember if it was her mother or her father. Her father?
CLIENT: Her mother was the second one that died.
THERAPIST: Yeah. She was going to wait until she was gone, and she got the message saying her mother had died just after the class. And she was just very open and candid [and present] about the whole thing.
CLIENT: Mmm-hmm. I had brought her cookies that day.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: That was three Thursdays ago. Like not the last Thursday, but the one before that.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: And the next so like that whole week, I spent like all the time thinking about her. There’s like a little bit of a guided reflection that the practice groups get at the end of every class. So I would come to think of what we talked about, various ways of seeing what our quality of ","P1-N400611":"attention is at work, whatever we consider our work is, because that’s what the class is about. But I would come to that point and I would just think all about Danielle [ph] and her mom, and her death, and the hug, and the cookies, and the wonder of it all.
THERAPIST: I was just going to ask you about it.
CLIENT: It’s so weird. Maybe like when I actually have one, I’ll know why it’s called an interview. But that’s the sort of dharma-way of like meeting with your teacher. It’s like you schedule an interview with this teacher or like you have regular interviews with your teacher.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: That’s what they call it there. It’s so weird. Like it must be a translation.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: But maybe it’s like an interview, I don’t know. So it’s like the way that you meet with a teacher privately at Meditation Center. Like you meet there at your scheduled time, and it’s sort of organized by the office there. So that brought up so much for me when she asked me that.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: And that seemed, at least in the few moments that I had yesterday, like having tasted what the practice would be like. It seems so enlivening because I’m not dead now.
THERAPIST: I might have heard his name in passing, but [I don’t know about him]. (long pause)
CLIENT: Jay, do you think you’ll ever go to Meditation Center?
THERAPIST: Hmm. (long pause) I have a funny thought about the initials.
CLIENT: Yeah?
THERAPIST: “See I am, see?”
CLIENT: (chuckles) (long pause)
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: (chuckles) I don’t think there’s anything there about me to see that you won’t see here.
THERAPIST: I guess I was thinking of seeing you somewhere else.
CLIENT: Right. (pause) Yeah, I think it’s pretty seductive to like think about seeing each other somewhere else. So that falls into that fantasy.
THERAPIST: Hmm. (long pause)
CLIENT: It’s kind of like asking, which I may have asked but I’ll ask again, if you think you’ll ever go to Italy.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: (pause) It’s important to me, I think, that you go. Not that you go with me or even that I’m there.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: (pause) So what were you thinking about when I just spoke? Right before I spoke? You were smiling.
THERAPIST: I think just your question. (pause)
CLIENT: [That’s sweet. It’s a sweet question].
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm. It is. (long pause) I guess I hear it somewhat as, will I ever be lost in you as you are in me? (long pause)
CLIENT: I hope so. (long pause) My eyes hurt.
THERAPIST: (pause) That’s too bad.
CLIENT: Hmm?
THERAPIST: That’s too bad.
CLIENT: Yeah, it’s distracting. (pause)
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: And, of course, like (pause) I imagine what you said last time at the end of the day the containers were like vessels. They will be one in the same or like they’re both both about (inaudible at 00:44:12). (pause)
THERAPIST: I don’t think that’s true in all ways. But in the context of what we were talking about at the time, I think that’s true.
CLIENT: I see. (long pause) So I wonder in what ways you don’t think in what ways you’re talking about.
THERAPIST: (pause) I think when it comes to things like dealing with emotions or emotions in relationships, there’s a lot of overlap.
CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.
THERAPIST: And things like [thoughts and symptoms]. (long pause)
CLIENT: There’s a lot of overlap?
THERAPIST: I think so.
CLIENT: And where there’s not overlap?
THERAPIST: (pause) I don’t I mean, I think that meditation practice brings you to a different place than therapy psychoanalysis does. (long pause)
CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.
THERAPIST: But I’m not sure that’s true. (long pause)
CLIENT: (sighing) (long pause)
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm. (long pause)
CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.
THERAPIST: But I also think that psychoanalysis has some benefits for helping people with neurotic suffering that probably will work better, at least at certain stages, for a fair number of people than meditation.
CLIENT: Do you think that’s because people don’t commit the same way when they’re alone as when they’re in a relationship?
THERAPIST: I think it may be part of it. I guess what I have in mind more is like there’s something a little easier for two people to bear or that one person, at least for a while, you know, requires the help of someone else -
CLIENT: Uh huh.
THERAPIST: to bear. [I don’t mean anything that fancy]. Just like, you know, if there are times I point out things it seems to me you’re avoiding or that are harder to tolerate. I think sometimes it can be easier to work with stuff like that that’s kind of on the edge with someone ","P1-N401171":"else who is helping that way.
CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.
THERAPIST: (pause) And providing more of a perspective. (long pause) I’m sorry, you were saying that it’s seductive to think about my practice. (pause)
CLIENT: I’m going to respond to what you were saying.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: (pause) I think there’s something (long pause) I think there’s something about the two person, two people holding (pause) or like holding and creating a sort of third unconscious or like holding and bringing light to like a third being that’s like not you.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: And when you have a whole other person involved, there is just so much more there’s more space for it, and there’s more creative potential for it. Two minds are two minds. (pause)
THERAPIST: I think meditation teachers can do that too.
CLIENT: Mmm-hmm. (long pause) I don’t know. I don’t have that relationship. (pause)
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And I was like “Thanks, sure” and then she left. (pause) It’s like very polarizing or it’s very confusing [to the things I brought up] and it’s similar (pause)
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: You know, is she like reaching for connections?
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And then there’s thoughts about well, maybe I want Sashi because Sashi is older and she’s got a totally different style. (pause) And she’s sort of got this grandmotherly, very wise, very few words, very deliberate way of speaking. It’s like warm gentleness, but it’s ","P1-N401571":"very sort of (pause) like wizardly. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: (laughter)
CLIENT: I’m like “I’m walking to the bus.” “Well, I just wanted to say, I’ve just been thinking about this, about Danielle [ph].” (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Let me just tell you when you get to the bus who is going to be driving the bus. (chuckles)
CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah.
THERAPIST: Sorry, go ahead. (chuckles)
CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. “Like I just wanted to “
THERAPIST: [“If I were you,” yeah.]
CLIENT: (chuckles) “I just wanted to let you know, like I’m sure Danielle [ph] is a very nice person.” (chuckles)
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: “But I just wanted to let you know what in our family we think about gurus.” I’m like “Mom, Danielle [ph] is not going to be my guru. Don’t worry.” She’s like “Okay, but just listen.”
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: It’s like we because it’s a big thing in Italy. This is like I mean, it’s land of guru-hood. It’s like everybody has somebody and it’s like this whole thing. There are all these quack aesthetics, and they’re all these people trying to follow some path ","P1-N4017B1":"of, I don’t know, like dealing with suffering. And there are a lot of crazy people out there and it’s kind of a scene.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: And being in a family where like I mean, being in a priestly (inaudible at 01:05:13) family, my mom and her siblings and her parents have come to form a lot of opinions about like the different ways of reaching God or whatever. Reaching the end of suffering. She’s like “We tend ","P1-N401811":"to not have like to pick one guru. There are a lot of people in the world who have very nice intentions, but there are a lot of people in the world who are just like crooked and like want to brainwash you. They want to take your money, and they want to have sex with you. They just like want you, ","P1-N401812":"and they’re driven by bad motives.
THERAPIST: “But in no way is that going to stop me from telling you.” (chuckles)
CLIENT: (chuckles) “But I just needed to share how we think about this, so we don’t have gurus.” I was like “Mom, that’s not true at all because you talk all the time about how your mom is your guru. You could say we don’t have any gurus, but you have one and it’s ","P1-N401891":"your mom.” She’s like “Yes, I do have one.” I was like “So this thing about how we don’t pick one guru is false. You just picked your mom.” She was like “But moms are different “
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: because moms really have their children’s -
THERAPIST: [You better believe it.]
CLIENT: best interests in mind.” That’s her reason for why moms are different. It’s like yeah, that’s true. I believe that. At least in the mom relationships in my family.
THERAPIST: Right. And also your best interests in their view.
CLIENT: Mmm-hmm. Yeah. (pause) Right. But I think her guru relationship, which is really quite studently at times, has like caused a tremendous amount of weirdness in her and in our family.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: Because when you like idolize and deify your mom, there’s a lot of letting go that hasn’t happened for her. (pause) “Hi, I’m Ada [ph], I’ve been thinking about this.” (chuckles) I’m remembering early on when like some of the things I’ve said, it’s ","P1-N4019B1":"pretty different about my parents.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So, she was like “Yes, we all -” Like I think all of her siblings feel the same way about Nonnie-jee [ph].
THERAPIST: Well, I hadn’t thought about that in a while. (pause) I don’t know. I guess to me like it sort of says a lot if that’s where your mom comes from on the topic of mothers and daughters.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Like she was crying when she said “Yes, my mom is my guru.” Her voice cracked. Like that is the that is the symbol of goodness in the world to her.
THERAPIST: Yeah, like the picture of her devotion.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) With grandma saying like (pause) My mom says a lot like “I’ll leave it God. I’ll leave it to God.” And I’ve been struggling with wanting to leave things, wanting to let things go, but like not really knowing having a lot of trouble letting ","P1-N401AB1":"go, changing. Like in very small ways, but it’s changing. So I said to you I almost want it’s like more natural to me to just leave them to my mom because she’s going to leave them to God instead of finding somewhere to leave them.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: And to notice the big difference in the relation that I have with her. (pause) But anyway, when you [and I’m not saying the] day I went to the Y where the boxing club is. Maybe it was on a Thursday. There were a couple of trainers there, and the boxing club is like this no-nonsense, ","P1-N401B71":"like in the basement, basement of this super old building.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: It’s just like a lot of boxing bags and the beautiful ring where Muhammad Ali fought. It’s the oldest boxing club in the country.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: And you just go and there are all these guys and some women. It’s, in general, a very nice vibe. Though I have four or five like black glom-on guys who glom onto me. But that’s another thing that’s not so comfortable, but I manage them okay. But anyway, I went to the boxing ","P1-N401C11":"gym and there’s this trainer Dan there, and he works people out when they want to be worked out.
THERAPIST: (pause) I did martial arts for a long time, and I did like some kickboxing for a while.
CLIENT: Cool. What kind of martial arts?
THERAPIST: Let’s see, I did karate and aikido and there’s a kind of kickboxing from Thailand, I did that, and Brazilian jujitsu.
CLIENT: Mmm. Do you practice any of those still? Did you like Brazilian jujitsu? It’s really cool.
THERAPIST: Yeah, it’s really cool.
CLIENT: (sighing) Brazilian jujitsu. Jeremy and I both really want to take it up.
THERAPIST: Oh really? Yeah, it’s awesome.
CLIENT: So Tim, at the end of our three rounds, said “You know, there’s this exhibition in March” and I was like “Cool, I’ll check it out.” He was like “You’ll check it out, but you won’t fight?” I was like “Uh, probably not, but I’ll ","P1-N401D71":"think about it.”
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But I think I would be amazing. (chuckles) So I think he was like -
THERAPIST: But you’re very good?
CLIENT: I mean, it’s hard to say if somebody is good when they box for conditioning.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So it’s like a whole different set of -
THERAPIST: If you haven’t sparred with somebody, yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah, it’s a completely different set of skills to spar. Complete I think it’s really different, but that said, I think I would pick it up pretty quickly and maybe that’s what he was recognizing. That I’m teachable, and curious, and learn fast, and I’m spunky, ","P1-N401ED1":"and I like hit hard.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: So maybe okay, I think one thing that’s clear is that I hit hard. But there’s a lot of footwork involved that I don’t have down at all. Anyway, I don’t want to fight in the exhibition at all. And I felt the same mix of like eww, go away. Like don’t brainwash ","P1-N401F11":"me. Like this sort of weird, vulnerable, protective wall thing. And then when you asked me or when you shared that you I’m trying to be precise about my language.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: When you shared that you thought that it was better to schedule another regular session rather than to go about things ad hoc, I felt the same mix.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: And that’s really surprising because like all I want is to see you more.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: So I like boxing, but I don’t want to do that at all. You were talking about something that I do want.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I felt I was like I felt some questioning of your motives.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: And like it didn’t help that my mom called and talked about brainwashing and how we don’t pick gurus. It didn’t help. It sort of like -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I think maybe that’s where I got it from.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: And it made that part much louder. (pause) And then my grandfather used the word guru on Monday -
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: to talk about me.
THERAPIST: To you.
CLIENT: It’s a weird guru week. (long pause)
THERAPIST: Well, I think there are probably ways that your mom has been your guru.
CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.
THERAPIST: Though I don’t have the sense of the ways that either of you would have talked about it. And also that there are I guess what I have in mind is the faith and devotion you have in her, among other things.
CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.
THERAPIST: And maybe also the dislike of difference or separation. And I think some of that also relates to you and me.
CLIENT: Mmm-hmm. (pause) I think the guru (pause) Okay, I really don’t what that word means. I have never thought about using it for any relationship I’ve had.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: It sort of turns me off. But like maybe actually you just go through life and you have different relationships, and they come to embody what that word means to you, depending on what relationships you have.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I think there are aspects of this relationship that are (long pause) I think that the transference and counter-transferenceness of a student-guru relationship, like that set is kind of different than what -
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: Patterns in my transferential relationships.
THERAPIST: Yeah, that’s usually the way. (pause) Another thought that crossed my mind before as you were talking to whether there are ways in which one aspect of what you’re sorting out with me is stuff your mother didn’t sort out with her mother.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But, you know, instead it somehow passed along to me.
CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.
THERAPIST: I don’t I’m not saying that from the standpoint of that’s definitely what’s going on, or that’s how to assign who is responsible for what. But more like that seems like a very reasonable story about this. Or it feels like that, among other things.
CLIENT: Mmm. Like if we had to submit a story today. If the deadline were today -
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: You would submit that story.
THERAPIST: (chuckles) I think you’re teasing me.
CLIENT: Oh, yeah. (chuckles) [It came up] that there are things that my dad hasn’t dealt with that he’s passed onto me in much the same way.
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: [Your bringing up of my] but that stuff feels (pause) With my mom, it feels like anxiety and separation and sort of this whole being devotedness. And with my dad, it feels like grief and grief and grief.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And like a childlike wonder.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: Which like I included because maybe it’s something that leads to suffering when people don’t deal with it. But maybe actually it leads to a whole amount of joy, I don’t know.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm. (long pause) My impression about I think it probably varies a lot across traditions, but like the guru thing in contemporary (inaudible at 01:27:14) practice is that it’s pretty complicated.
CLIENT: Mmm.
THERAPIST: Like sort of transferential stuff along with who the teacher is as a real-life flesh and blood limited human being.
CLIENT: Uh huh. You’re not limited, no. What are you saying?
THERAPIST: I wasn’t talking about me.
CLIENT: Oh, okay. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I think one difference with us and this is not at all to say there can’t be problems with this. Of course there can. But like a lot of the point has to do with dealing with that. Whereas -
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: That’s not necessarily the case with meditation teachers.
CLIENT: Like a lot of the point is to do with your practice and deal with how you might deal with what comes up between you and your teacher, but not deal with it between you and your teacher.
THERAPIST: Yeah, it’s to sort out like what’s your idealization of them -
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: versus who they actually are but to like yeah.
CLIENT: I was thinking about the role of sex.
THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.
CLIENT: And how like sex might not ruin a meditation teacher’s ability to be a good teacher. Maybe like with that student. It would? But maybe not. I don’t know.
THERAPIST: It’s very complicated.
CLIENT: Not complicated at all.
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: Sex is so simple.
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: [When you want it]. (long pause) Do you think that’s a difference in a meditation teacher-student relationship and a relationship like this? (long pause)
THERAPIST: Do I think that the difference with like having sex with patients makes a therapist unable to be a good therapist with any patient? Whereas with a meditation teacher, it’s possibly just limited to the student that they’re having sex with?
CLIENT: Do you think the role I don’t know if I like that theory.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: But it seems to me like the role of sex is the scope of how much it ruins is more limited in a meditation teacher-student relationship. (long pause)
THERAPIST: I don’t know. I’m not sure that’s true. (pause)
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I don’t I mean, I think like clearly with a psychoanalyst, it can ruin quite a lot. I’m not sure it’s necessarily less.
CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.
THERAPIST: I think it depends with the meditation teacher.
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, maybe.
THERAPIST: I think we should stop for now. (long pause)
CLIENT: Why is it so clear what’s been left out when it’s time to leave? It’s not clear the rest of the time.
THERAPIST: Mmm.
CLIENT: That’s the trippy thing about (inaudible at 01:33:11).
THERAPIST: (pause) [It’s because your having to leave takes up half of the ambivalence that’s otherwise inside.]
CLIENT: Like so now that I have to leave, there’s all this space? (pause) Yeah, I think it takes up over half. Like 99 percent.
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: [Of goodbye].
THERAPIST: I see. (long pause) I can’t help but to joke at least there’s not aging and sickness every time.
CLIENT: There’s aging always, Jay.
