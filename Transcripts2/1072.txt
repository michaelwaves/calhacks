TITLE: Client "Ma", Session February 03, 2014: Client discusses suicide, isolation, and the inability to open up to others about depression and suicide.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses suicide, isolation, and the inability to open up to others about depression and suicide.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:00:05)
CLIENT: You too. I’m feeling a little better today.
THERAPIST: Good. I think I was a little slow getting back to you on Friday as well.
CLIENT: No, that’s okay. Actually, yeah, no, I was sort of doing pretty badly and like quite badly, and I was like, “You know, I should just call Chad,” like I should just do that, and then we ended up watching some TV and then that like really helped. The thing that’s been like ","P1-N400111":"probably the most weird and confusing for me and not weak or through it felt like [00:01:08]
THERAPIST: Represent that part at all, really. [00:03:03]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah, what seems more like descriptive or expressive of that other side is like how much suicidal thinking you’re having and the cutting. [00:04:13]
CLIENT: Yeah, it seems like I called you last night and I like I’m scared, and I felt like it might have come across that I was scared in a general sense, but I was like scared about last night, like about what are the next two hours going to be like for me, like am I going to make it through ","P1-N4001F1":"three hours? [00:05:17]
THERAPIST: Yeah. But that certainly is how it seems to me as well. [00:07:57]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So no, I, that makes sense to me. Yeah, I’m not yet clear how to understand. [00:09:03]
CLIENT: James seems relatively unfreaked by this. That’s good.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: I mean, he’s scared, but I think my sort of, my worry is that I’ll recapitulate all this sort of traumatic parts of the last couple of years for him in this. [00:11:21]
THERAPIST: What was Curtis’ (sp) idea that was going on?
CLIENT: He seemed to sort of think that it was a largely coming from like being, feeling more secure and more hopeful about the future, done like as things start to stabilize and get better that I’m reacting against that.
THERAPIST: Is that different from?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Pretty much. Well I sort of suggested, I suggested that it’s one of a couple things that might be going on, and he’s like, “Yeah.” [00:12:02]
THERAPIST: It’s really not that remarkable that we would agree (inaudible at [00:12:27]).
CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) [00:13:00]
THERAPIST: Table it for now.
CLIENT: Yeah. And then I feel sort of like, I don’t feel very good about like then after the fact, telling you that, because that’s not really addressing the problem, but I do feel like that it helps me like go back the next week and say, “I do want to do this.”
THERAPIST: Right, right.
CLIENT: That’s just [00:15:02]
THERAPIST: I think, what you can get into I think, because you’re talking today, is the difficulty of like communicating these sorts of things. [00:17:14]
CLIENT: Yeah. I seem to be, because I don’t say it.
THERAPIST: And your feeling is, I don’t know, what you said earlier today was, you know, you don’t know how to say it, but feeling it and not knowing how to say it. But what it looks more like, from a little on the outside, is that you don’t want to, you know. [00:19:07]
CLIENT: I don’t know. I feel like in some ways. This is maybe something sort of related, but think, in terms of not telling friends and family that I’m having a hard time. I feel like it’s, I feel better about being isolated if I’m sort of isolating myself than if I’m telling ","P1-N400631":"people about it and then I’m still isolated.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Like the thing I am, the thing that seems really devastating to me is to tell people about it. Maybe nothing they can do, or nothing they care to do. [00:21:16]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But it’s sort of looming large for me. [00:22:00]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at [00:22:00]). I think, I think that on the one hand you are really worried. You know, I think when you, depending on how open you are, how direct, you really put yourself in someone hands and tell them how you’re doing. You know, last hour you said, “I’m not ","P1-N4006F1":"doing very well,” moreso than your saying, “Yeah, I don’t know if I’m going to deal with (inaudible at [00:22:57]) in the next hour, same or different state. [00:23:05]
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: And the second one says, (inaudible at [00:23:09]) I think. I think you’re putting it in its own hands and I think there’s in some sense, like the real worry that the other person won’t, I guess he won’t respond helpfully or there won’t be anything they can do ","P1-N400731":"as you said. But I think there’s something else too which is like [00:24:08]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And maybe that’s where some of the complexity is, that it’s hard to know if it’s going to feel like the other person can do something about it or not. I think last night on the phone it probably did feel like I did something, or was there, you know, like—
CLIENT: I don’t know. Actually, it felt pretty bad, I think. [00:26:02]
THERAPIST: It’s about the same. No, I’m glad you’re letting me know. I had to say it, only because you mentioned you were better today.
CLIENT: Yeah, but yeah.
THERAPIST: Either that, whatever, you said after you got off the phone last night. Yeah, I think it feels like telling people about it sort of puts myself in their hands, both in terms of like that, in that moment, like will they be able to help? [00:27:25]
THERAPIST: But I think of you always, always being worried about sort of driving people away like that. I guess it feels like it’s often not just about driving them away in that moment, but like (inaudible at [00:29:43]).
CLIENT: Yeah. My conversation with (inaudible at [00:29:50]) this morning sort of boiled down to him saying, “Don’t worry about it.” Just, he didn’t actually say, “Don’t worry about it,” but just said that—
THERAPIST: Meaning “Don’t worry about how I react to how you’re feeling now?”
CLIENT: Yeah. Like don’t worry that I’ll feel abandoned, or rather he’s saying, “Don’t worry that I’ll feel abandoned.” [00:30:15]
THERAPIST: Yeah. I think it also makes you mad.
CLIENT: Yeah, a little bit. I guess I sort of felt like I have a lot to carry right now, can I not carry you? And he said, he’s tried to say yes, don’t worry about carrying me, but in the way that makes it, that he’s saying like, “No, you still have to keep worrying about me.” [00:31:11]
THERAPIST: Maybe that is a way in which no one is really there for you. Like with the possibility that this could go on like this for years and years. [00:35:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. It can then confuse me and like can sometimes people get through. It’s hard to believe. And like I know that it’s not always something that people go through.
THERAPIST: Do you mean sometimes with it for a long time and then sometimes (inaudible at [00:35:53]) before that.
CLIENT: I mean, yeah. [00:36:00]
THERAPIST: So he is kind of abandoning you there that, when he says, “I don’t want to live with this the rest of our lives, but now is not the time,” when you think about it that way. And it sounds like that is part of how you’re thinking about it.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And there’s sort of this, it’s like this sort of side of me that is very hopeful and optimistic and is doing things. [00:38:15]
THERAPIST: It’s just a pretend future.
CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) [00:39:59]
THERAPIST: (Long pause continues) It seems to me that you (inaudible at [00:43:48]), and the feeling that (inaudible at [00:43:52]), whatever failure, but like abandonment, really. And more or less a form like talking to the other person. [00:43:52]
CLIENT: Yeah.
