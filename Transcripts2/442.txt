TITLE: Client "K", Session April 10, 2014: Client discusses struggling to be more engaged and interested with daily life.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses struggling to be more engaged and interested with daily life.
CLIENT: I guess [pause] I guess I’ve just kind of been thinking about again, yes, kind of what I can do to make things kind of easier, kind of not as, or cover what I should do about this everyday kind of feeling of being tired and not really wanting to be engaged or be I guess more specifically ","P1-N4000B1":"I guess kind of just what I should do because it always feels like I’m pushing myself or making some kind of, making myself anxious thinking I have to do this or I should be doing this. [00:03:23]
THERAPIST: What you’re talking about is sort of questioning and thinking about what to do about it rather than more like succumbing to it? [00:05:42]
CLIENT: Right. [Pause] So the things I could think of that would help or, I don’t know, but they’re very vague and broad. Just kind of sift like how things are when I’m tired or that I don’t like something instead of always fighting it or I don’t know trusting myself more ","P1-N400151":"or being more grateful or something. [00:07:32]
THERAPIST: What you want in terms of plans?
CLIENT: Right. But I don’t know [pause] it seems doubtful because I’m sidetracked or it’s always tough [pause] or I’m easily persuaded else-wise (ph). [00:09:47]
THERAPIST: Well I imagine that there are things that would potentially make you anxious about the things you mentioned trying. I guess something yields a kind of passivity that would go along with accepting for example being tired rather than and [inaudible at 00:10:57] said or worried that in trusting ","P1-N4001F1":"yourself you’d be making some kind of mistake or that you had it wrong. [Pause] I’m not saying not to do it; I’m just saying that might relate to the kind of dynamics [around it] (ph). [00:11:58]
CLIENT: I’m extremely skeptical but I feel like I need to do something. I need to, I don’t know, yes kind of get outside my comfort zone or push or something like that. But [pause] yes, I don’t know. I really don’t know what to do or even how to kind of view the problem in terms ","P1-N400211":"of I just need to change my perspective or do I need to change, I don’t know, something I’m doing or not doing? I don’t know. [00:13:54]
THERAPIST: Well I actually it seems possible that it’s actually a pretty interesting moment. It seems to me that you are questioning the way you’ve been going about things and you’re a little bit you’re questioning the paradigm in a way that I think you kind of haven’t ","P1-N400231":"quite before. I mean you’ve been frustrated with it, you’ve wanted to get rid of it but I guess it seems to me like your angle on it is a bit different now. [00:15:13]
CLIENT: Maybe. [Pause] I mean [pause] I guess I need, I don’t know, the shell analogy makes it sound like I shouldn’t [just connect] (ph) with another shield or kind of illusion. I don’t know, it’s kind of defy or something. And I still feel like I still don’t really understand ","P1-N4002B1":"what the problem is or what I need. [00:19:43]
THERAPIST: I guess how I’m thinking about it is if the way you do things now is a shield, what it’s protecting you from I think is this sense of disappointment that you were referring to yesterday. [00:20:43]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I see. [Pause] I basically agree with that, that I don’t yet understand either why that is or how that works. In other words what motivates it. [00:24:54]
CLIENT: So I guess I just get, I don’t know, kind of angry because I don’t know what to do other than what I’ve been doing and it just feels helpless even though I’m kind of willing to try or willing to see things apparently [inaudible] around. [00:26:58]
THERAPIST: I actually think you are doing something quite significant, perhaps you’ll see this differently, in it seems to me sort of investigating, questioning and criticizing this sort of paradigm that you’ve been living with and that dictates a lot about how you are living your life. [00:27:52]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: It’s like standing up to something terrifying I think. [00:29:06]
CLIENT: Right. But I guess where I am now is kind of feels like okay I’m going to quit eating sugar but I’m going to still have ice cream. And the ice cream is kind of like I still want to be productive, I still want, I don’t know, I’m still kind of holding onto it or something. ","P1-N4004B1":"It’s still kind of there, I guess.
THERAPIST: Absolutely. Yes, I [pause] I [inaudible at 00:30:05] see it that way too, that it’s still there in a very big way. This is not like something you overthrow in a short period of time. I mean it’s certainly not the way this certain thing works. [Pause] But I do think that what you ","P1-N4004D1":"have been doing and are doing is kind of making inroads. [00:30:58]
CLIENT: No, I guess it’s kind of wanting to be productive or all these things are steamrolled or to have it separated.
THERAPIST: I see, okay. And so it’s -
CLIENT: Otherwise it seems like it’s going to I don’t know. Yes, I’ll just do nothing.
THERAPIST: Right. Yes, I think, okay. I think the very kind of incremental and basically the way that we’re dealing with this which is very incremental and kind of non-linear in the sense that it’s not well you do this and do this and do this and that helps. You know what I mean? It feels ","P1-N4005B1":"very roundabout I think and passive in that way. [00:33:37]
CLIENT: I feel like I need something, I don’t know, to remind, to not kind of fall back in or kind of remind myself I don’t even know what, [laughs] just remind myself that it doesn’t have to be this way or something like that. [00:35:22]
THERAPIST: I see. That there could be another way?
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I wonder, I don’t think this is all of what you’re talking about by any means, but I wonder if there’s a piece of that that’s coming up because it’s a Thursday and we’re not going to talk again until Monday. [00:36:38]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And so I don’t think it always feels this way. Recently it has been, there were moments I think where it’s felt like I am with you contending against this thing. And it’ll be on your list for a few days. [00:37:38]
CLIENT: Right. I mean it’s just easier to kind of be I don’t know. It’s like get lost or kind of slipped away or backsliding, whatever. When I don’t, yes, come here it just kind of, it’s like I’m thrown back in or something. [00:38:40]
THERAPIST: Well we should finish up for now. [00:42:44]
