TITLE: Client "R", Session March 4, 2013: Client reads a speech she wrote for her father, talks about a recent family gathering, and her mother's depression during her infancy.
DESCRIPTION: Client reads a speech she wrote for her father, talks about a recent family gathering, and her mother's depression during her infancy.
THERAPIST: Good morning.
CLIENT: Good morning. How are you?
THERAPIST: I'm doing okay. Let's see, a quick thing about insurance. So Blue Cross seems to be paying up over the rate they said they would.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You saw that too?
CLIENT: (pause) I don't know. I'll let you finish.
THERAPIST: Okay. So — I mean, I don't need to take any more than I'm taking. It's not exactly an error, I don't think, for various reasons. At least, I don't feel compelled to let them know. (pause) So, I mean, my thought was essentially just to credit you or write you a check.
CLIENT: That sounds great.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: Since I asked for it back, I can give it back.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: The day before you called them — (pause) I don't know what the order was, but there is the day that we got the letter that (pause) denied the request. Then that day, I got a check from them.
THERAPIST: Hmmm.
CLIENT: For an amount that seemed over like what I had expected had they approved the request.
THERAPIST: Huh.
CLIENT: Which is why it wasn't clear to me that you had communicated with them at all and that there was an error, so that's what prompted me to call them the next day.
THERAPIST: Huh.
CLIENT: (pause) But it doesn't matter.
THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah, so I'll write you a check for what they've done so far and (pause) and I don't know if they'll — I guess I won't keep doing it if they approve more visits, but we'll wait and see. And can I just have like my bank send a check to your house? Is that okay?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Or you can remove it from the check that I'm going to write you.
THERAPIST: I think you're actually ahead at this point.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I'll double check, but I think that's right.
CLIENT: That's a lot of money that they're giving you then. (pause) Okay, it doesn't matter.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: (pause) So the party was really great. (pause) And my speech was really great.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: Can I read it to you?
THERAPIST: Of course.
CLIENT: (pause) I wanted to memorize it, but I didn't. (long pause) "I wanted to offer some thoughts about what a special person my dad is. So as any scientist knows, I'm sure most of you will certainly appreciate this.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: [It's a nice speech]. (pause)
THERAPIST: You're such a loving and devoted daughter.
CLIENT: I needed to say those things, I guess. It came out — it came out pretty easily.
THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm.
CLIENT: I had a couple —
THERAPIST: And joyfully.
CLIENT: Yeah. I had a couple of sitting sessions where I just sort of like used him as the object of focus and (pause) then I just like wrote it on the day of the party. I had written down like little notes from each session, and I used my grandfather and my mom for a couple of the examples. (pause) ","P1-N400931":"I spent a lot of time going through his Master's and Ph.D. theses, but what I really wanted to look at was his harvester thesis as an undergrad.
THERAPIST: That does make a certain kind of sense.
CLIENT: It does, but it wasn't obvious.
THERAPIST: Yeah. No, I understand. It just sounds like you worked very hard. I mean, happily, but —
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: — but hard.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know why other people don't work hard or like why it doesn't tire them out. Most people don't float the way that I do. (pause) I mean, one extreme is Jeremy who had people coming up to him all evening, and he was like sort of in the same general area the whole time. That's how he's comfortable.
CLIENT: And like doesn't really feel compelled to approach other people. But my parents are both social butterflies and move from group to group.
THERAPIST: And your sort of goal or intention is to connect with everybody there.
CLIENT: Mmmm-hmmm. (pause) Yeah, like in the best, most focused way that I can. (pause) So I guess I'm like always thinking about what's going on in other people's lives, like what I can ask them about. (pause)
THERAPIST: I don't think it's solely because there are only a few people who could be talking to everyone that you're one of the only people who is.
CLIENT: Mmmm-hmmm.
THERAPIST: [There might be multiple reasons for it but it seems important]. (pause)
CLIENT: One is that I feel (pause) like I need to show my devotion and interest. That like people need to be reminded. (long pause)
THERAPIST: Right. "How was the trip in?"
CLIENT: Right. Like I show up and I'm like "How is blah blah blah's blah?"
THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm.
CLIENT: Like "Whatever happened to" —
THERAPIST: "How is your son doing at college?"
CLIENT: Not even that. Like "Whatever happened to your son's basketball coach thing?"
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: Or like —
THERAPIST: Like a very specific reference to a previous conversation.
CLIENT: Yeah. Or often people — people were also coming up to me a lot, and like a couple of my dad's colleagues like really wanted me to send them the speech which was kind of pretty cool but — (pause)
THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm. (pause) Yeah, it's like you really — almost maybe even a little bit like scrupulously sort of bring yourself to each conversation.
CLIENT: What does "scrupulously" mean?
THERAPIST: Like with careful attention.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I got like stuck in that mode. I can't like pull myself out and zone out.
THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm.
CLIENT: Or like go back to where I'm just like sitting.
THERAPIST: Yeah, you've been very very on.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And enjoying it and into it —
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: — and immersed. But also sort of, and most importantly, not aware of how much energy and effort it takes and how it can tire you out after a while.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think I realized it kind of a lot later.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (long pause) The thought that I had was that — (pause)
CLIENT: Mmmm-hmmm.
THERAPIST: And part of your sort of devotion and appreciation for them.
CLIENT: (pause) They don't — (pause) They don't show their devotion in the same way.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: Like in what kind of spirit I'm bringing to it.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: (pause) If you're not sort of touching your mouth when you offer a suggestion or an interpretation, your hand goes to your mouth.
THERAPIST: Huh. I never knew that. (chuckles)
CLIENT: (chuckles) [You have to feel unconscious about it now].
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: But it happens. [It's like that's your position for like — (pause) I made an offer and let's do that].
THERAPIST: Huh.
CLIENT: (pause) I found out more about my very early relationship with the oldest female cousin. She was there. (pause) First of all, my parents think that it was a matter of a couple of days that I was really, really sad and gloomy.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I still remember as feeling like a couple of weeks, but I'm sure they're right. They said that the ride up was extremely painful. That was like the worst of it where it was like the transition.
THERAPIST: They had just moved there?
CLIENT: Yeah, just moved. My dad had just —
THERAPIST: Done his defense, yeah.
CLIENT: Just defended. I was three weeks old when they moved, and then my mom had never lived away from home and had this new daughter and was like totally depressed for about a year.
THERAPIST: What was it?
CLIENT: The business? I think it was like a mart, some kind of bodega.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: He's an entomologist.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: He was teaching also, but I think he's always had an interest in business but I don't think he had — it doesn't sound like it was a very fruitful venture.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So they couldn't talk on the phone, and her sister lived like an hour and a half away, so I think that was really important for her to get through.
THERAPIST: Was your dad working long hours?
CLIENT: Yeah, I think he was probably working at least — (pause) So it was an hour commute, so he was probably gone at least nine hours of the day. I mean —
THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm.
CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know what his hours were. (pause) Okay, so I like got really obsessed with finding my dad's undergraduate dissertation.
THERAPIST: The harvester?
CLIENT: Yeah. So I was like looking at the university's web archive and — anyway, in the process, I found out that I can look at anybody's dissertation in the whole world, and I spent a bunch of time reading yours.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: (pause) I had to disclose that.
THERAPIST: What were your thoughts and reaction?
CLIENT: (pause) Well, okay, so I was like writing the speech so I wasn't really reading it for content.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: I was reading it for nuggets of deep insight about your personality —
THERAPIST: Hmmm.
CLIENT: — and your life and there wasn't really a lot of those. (pause) I wonder what my mom, the infant mother dyad, the nature of our dyad was when I was an infant.
THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm.
CLIENT: It sounds like it falls more into she was withdrawn and I was — (pause)
THERAPIST: Fussy?
CLIENT: Fussy rather than her being intrusive and my being — (pause) Whatever.
THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:33:30]
CLIENT: Yeah, avoidant. Just from like what I have heard about what she was going through at that time. (pause)
THERAPIST: Is it also possible — I don't mean this as a comment how she was, I don't know. But, you know, some mothers who are depressed pull it together pretty well.
CLIENT: I think she was probably one of them.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I think relative to the rest of her life, this was the darkest time for her.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But it doesn't sound like there is anything outstanding about how she treated me or how she interacted with me. I don't know.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (long pause)
THERAPIST: We have about five minutes. (long pause) One thing I'm wondering about is the extent to which you feel (pause) a similar kind of pull or sense of being on in how you want to talk and connect here. (pause)
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I was just thinking about that too.
THERAPIST: Yep.
CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I really do feel that way. I don't know what I would lose. (pause) I guess I would (pause) waste minutes.
THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm.
CLIENT: (pause) That I'm going to lose the chance to (pause) show you how (pause) committed I am.
THERAPIST: Hmmm.
CLIENT: Or how special you should think I am.
THERAPIST: Hmmm.
CLIENT: (pause) But I don't feel the extra layer of filtering or censoring here. It doesn't feel like — I don't feel like I'm (pause) planning or scheming or anything.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: It just feels like (pause) whatever I have at this time, like should be yours in such a way that (pause) you really see who I am and appreciate it and love it. (pause)
THERAPIST: Somehow that could happen differently if you weren't as focused like — you know what I mean?
CLIENT: (pause) I know — I understand what you're saying. I don't know —
THERAPIST: What I'm getting at?
CLIENT: I don't know how it would happen differently.
THERAPIST: I see. (pause) I guess I had the thought that there's maybe something that gets left out a little bit in making the effort. I'm not saying that it's bad to make an effort. That's certainly not what I'm saying. But that there's some part of you that gets left behind a little bit.
CLIENT: Mmmm-hmmm.
THERAPIST: Or judged by you not quite as good or worthwhile in some way. I think it's the part that isn't involved with trying or something.
CLIENT: (pause) I think I get why it feels so scary to not want to try in general and why it feels like that's going to be the end of the world (pause) if I fall into (pause) a space where I'm not feeling connected or I'm not feeling momentum or (pause) like not trying.
THERAPIST: It may be irrelevant, but it's just funny how these things come up together. It does make me think of your mom being kind of depressed when you were little and feeling like even she could manage that pretty well in how she was with you, that it took effort. (pause) Do you know what I mean? ","P1-N401CD1":"Like [had to gather herself somewhat].
CLIENT: (pause) What's the alternative? (pause)
THERAPIST: Well, I'm not going to answer that one. I guess you may be asking rhetorically.
CLIENT: No, I don't — I can't imagine a model (pause) of the alternative. [inaudible at 00:44:39].
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: (pause) I think I have to make it. (pause) Like figure out what the model is for me. (pause)
THERAPIST: We need to stop unfortunately. (long pause)
CLIENT: What?
THERAPIST: I'll have to think about [inaudible at 00:45:30].
CLIENT: You don't have to think about it at all.
THERAPIST: I think I do, to tell you the truth. I think it's so that I will shut up and let you talk.
CLIENT: Bye.
