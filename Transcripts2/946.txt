DESCRIPTION: Client discusses their feelings of alienation when relating to others.
THERAPIST: …Code is -
CLIENT: I’m not going to remember it.
THERAPIST: (inaudible 00:04)
CLIENT: Actually, I can just write it down.
THERAPIST: I think pound 7 0 3 2 pound will work.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Sure. (Pause) Yeah, sorry (inaudible 00:45).
CLIENT: You know, it was kind of funny. So James gets home tonight. He seems to have actually been able to do what he went up there to do, so that’s really good. So he’s sending off the samples that he made for analysis.
THERAPIST: [That’s all right] (ph). (inaudible 02:21)
CLIENT: Like, the biggest thing I can think of to say is, like, well, they’re sort of rednecks, except I feel like I I feel like, you know, (inaudible 02:43) more James than myself kind of girl but rednecks, and so we (inaudible 02:48). Pacific Northwest rednecks? Is that a thing? I don’t ","P1-N400211":"know. Anyway, they’re really fun.
THERAPIST: Where are they from?
CLIENT: I don’t know. I think the husband’s from somewhere around here (inaudible 03:09) Midwest.
THERAPIST: (inaudible 03:17) there’s probably some different name for something like that (inaudible 03:22).
CLIENT: Fair enough, yeah. Yeah. (inaudible 03:28) usually, like, freaking (inaudible 03:37), like, massive amounts of meat (ph). It’s really fun. (Laughter) I feel like sports and videogames are the two areas that, like, I just am not equipped to deal with socially. Like, I just got nothing. ","P1-N400291":"I like playing sports, but I just, you know, I enjoy watching sports games, but I don’t care enough to I don’t care enough to follow a team, ever, or to watch a game if it’s not everyone else is doing or to go to a game.
THERAPIST: What are you referring to?
CLIENT: Just, like, (pause) not really wanting to be alive.
THERAPIST: (inaudible 11:29) you’re describing feeling alienated or disconnected. Or kind of not wanting to be here. And (pause) I think that’s probably what it’s like. I think there’s a lot of kind of (inaudible 12:14) alienation and not wanting, like just not wanting to be ","P1-N4003F1":"at the playground when…
CLIENT: That’s pretty good. (Laughter)
THERAPIST: (inaudible 12:28)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like, you want to be dead. I guess what I mean is (pause) not just that you don’t want to be here on this earth, but also here in this room, talking to me when you’re feeling that way, which involves also a sense of alienation. And then, like, (pause) maybe also, like, (inaudible ","P1-N400471":"13:08), “Are we done yet?”
CLIENT: I don’t know. I mean, I would rather be here than most other places. (Pause) (inaudible 13:28) not to look too hard, but the distinction between I would rather do this and I would actually want to do this. I mean, you know. [Would you] (ph)? I don’t know. So yeah, you’re right.
THERAPIST: I think I missed the distinction -
CLIENT: Oh, that, like just because I would rather be here than most things doesn’t mean that I want to be here.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: If I look at that too hard and, like, you know, all of my options start to look pretty (ph) bad.
THERAPIST: (inaudible 16:40) pedestrians.
CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) Yeah, yeah. Even in my sleep, I dream. (Pause) And I don’t usually like, I don’t remember dreams very well, but tend to remember, like, not what happened but, like, the emotions that I had in the dream. (Pause) [Things are] (ph) pretty anxious and frustrating for ","P1-N400591":"me [at night] (ph).
THERAPIST: Yeah. I’m sure the kids help with that.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, they do.
THERAPIST: (inaudible 19:24) with you and (inaudible 19:27), like, just finding something for yourself to -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: [Pay attention to] (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah. You know, [it’s like I’m here] (ph). I think one of the things that’s helpful here is the sense that, like, there’s a problem (inaudible 19:59). Like…
THERAPIST: Yeah, there seems to be something about when the focus is instead really (ph) on you. That it’s much more involved (ph). That it’s supposed to (inaudible 20:52) like, when there’s a problem (inaudible 20:58)
CLIENT: I guess I mean like it’s like I come here and, you know, we do, like, talk about (inaudible 21:06) a lot of it is talking about not, like, what not, like, this moment, but more general things [about me] (ph). And that (inaudible 21:28) [tend to frame it] (ph) as a problem. [That’s ","P1-N4006F1":"what I do] (ph). I don’t think I said that very well.
THERAPIST: People hardly ever tip.
CLIENT: Okay, good.
THERAPIST: Used to, but not -
CLIENT: What?
THERAPIST: Used to, but not anymore.
CLIENT: James has this is so James. He’s got, like, a book where he keeps track of, like, total mileage of the car. The miles that it went since the last time you pumped gas. The date. How expensive the gas was. How much he got. Like, he just keeps track of all of it. I usually remember to update ","P1-N400831":"it. (Pause) That’s one of the things that is (ph), like, both very useful and also kind of irritating. And also, I just find adorable. (Laughter) [Can you imagine that] (ph)? Yeah.
THERAPIST: Years ago, we called them circles of death. (Laughter)
CLIENT: Yeah. People just, like, drive into me because (inaudible 28:42) to get off and, you know, why are you going in this direction? But, you know, that’s fine. I don’t think it would be fine for James. It’s distracting. (Pause) (inaudible 29:16) the first couple of years that I ","P1-N400891":"had a car, I loved driving. I didn’t have a car until I was in college. (inaudible 29:30) I liked being able to get in the car and start driving, and know that, like, I didn’t have to come back if I didn’t want to. Like, I could just keep going.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Not being okay. (Laughter) Rather than or reconcile myself to trying to fix it, which is annoying. I’m glad. I feel like I did something (inaudible 33:30). (Pause) (inaudible 33:39) he doesn’t like to wear t-shirts. He doesn’t he just doesn’t like them. I think he ","P1-N400951":"gets, like, claustrophobic about, like, necks. So...
THERAPIST: I’m wondering if you aren’t actually just distracting yourself, but also do (pause) you generally feel good about some of the things that occupy you. With the kids or with James.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. No, I do. You know, (pause) I, like it goes in and out. Like, I (pause) that’s one thing that I don’t really understand about it, is that, like, (inaudible 36:16) like where my life is right now. I really like a lot of the things in it and, you know, (inaudible 36:29).
THERAPIST: Maybe somehow it’s also very important to maintain that idea that, really, you want to just kill yourself all the time, unless you’re distracted. (Pause) Even if it’s not true. I’m not saying I (inaudible 36:59) true, or even that -
CLIENT: (inaudible 37:00)
THERAPIST: Untrue. But (pause) yeah.
CLIENT: That sounds like it’s probably right. (inaudible 37:32)
THERAPIST: Sure. Know why? (Laughter) I had a thought (ph). (Pause) Okay, so earlier, (pause) wherever you were talking about your friends or people talking about sports or videogames. You’re like, “You can talk about sports. I got nothing,” you know. (Pause) I think that’s actually ","P1-N400A71":"a little complicated, and maybe in a way that’s parallel to feeling suicidal. Like, the (pause) okay, so, like, with the sports thing. You don’t like sports. You’re not into sports. People are talking about sports. You don’t have much to say. You feel, like, kind of alienated. ","P1-N400A72":"What are you going to do? I think this is how you can feel like that. Like, “It sucks. I’m in so much pain. I don’t want to be here. Other (ph) things feel awful or impossible. What am I going to do?”
CLIENT: [I am] (ph). [So, like, I hear you] (ph). (Pause) It doesn’t feel like it fits perfectly, but I’m not really sure how. I don’t know.
THERAPIST: [We should] (ph) stop, [for now] (ph).
