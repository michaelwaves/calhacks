DESCRIPTION: Client got black-out drunk on her birthday, and ended up with a minor concussion and a fractured nose. She says this was a wake-up call for her, especially given the history of alcoholism in her family.
CLIENT: So... (SIGH)
THERAPIST: Ready, set, go?
CLIENT: Right. Okay. (LAUGHTER) So last Friday I was getting ready my like big birthday night out. Okay? I had a great day on Saturday with Steph (ph). I had a family dinner on Friday, great day with Steph on Saturday. We went shopping, did all this stuff. Got to the hotel. You know, I think I told ","P1-N4000F1":"you. I got a hotel room from a friend who got me a discount because then like... I just thought it would be fun to sleep over with Steph and be closer to the club that we were going to and all this stuff. And we got to the hotel at like 6:30. We had been like eating all day. I'd be eating all day because ","P1-N4000F2":"I knew that if I was going to be drinking I need to make sure like I had eaten enough. So I like ate quesadillas and pasta. I ate like... I had a sandwich. Like all sorts of stuff. Right? I ordered a pizza at the hotel from room service, had a couple slices, had a big piece of cake that I brought from ","P1-N4000F3":"my house that was what my mom had made. She made me a cake. (SIGH) And then my friend Amanda (ph) who can't come because she lives in Chicago sent me some chocolate covered strawberries and champagne. I started drinking the champagne. I had like a couple glasses of the champagne and Steph was like, ","P1-N4000F4":""Wow. You're face is like really, really red." Like it was like all right here. [00:01:01]
THERAPIST: Oh my gosh.
CLIENT: And I was like, "Oh, like, maybe it's because I was drinking the champagne and it's hot in here. I don't know." We had like turned up the heat. She had showered. Whatever. So I was like, "I'm going to take one Benadryl because to make the redness go down." And I didn't really think about it ","P1-N400131":"in terms of like I'm drinking. I... It was like seven. Like... I just didn't really make any connection and I had probably done that before because I take on Benadryl... Like if I am... If I...
THERAPIST: You're talking about two Fridays ago.
CLIENT: Two Saturdays ago.
THERAPIST: Saturdays, okay.
CLIENT: Well so the last time I saw you the next day.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. Anyways, whatever.
THERAPIST: Yeah (inaudible).
CLIENT: So I like take a shower, get ready, have a little... I don't even know. That's the problem. Like a couple more glasses of champagne? Some other friends get there; we had a mixed drink, had a cocktail because we had vodka or whatever. And then we leave. And I walked to the... And our friends ","P1-N400231":"had met there and I walked with Lucas and Stephen there, tow of our friends. Lucas is Aidan's roommate who Steph is seeing. [00:02:01]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Then we had to go back to the hotel to pick Steph and Aidan up and check out. I'm like, like just like a mess, like crying kind of like... Just trying to understand what happened. Like trying to figure out if I have a concussion what do I do? I don't know what the fuck. [00:10:01]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...I had the phone interview for the really low paying job.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Which went really well and it would've been a really awesome job like doing certain activities, which is like educational stuff and it would be about in the community and it would be really awesome. But it didn't pay enough and then they filled it. So it's fine. So that's the job stuff. Nothing's ","P1-N400451":"really happened. I followed up today. Okay, whatever.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Then Wednesday I go back to work and I had told my boss what happened. Because I was like, "I'm just going to be honest. Like there's no need not to be." I told everyone else I had a bad flu. But I told her because I just felt like it was appropriate. And she was fine and understanding and like, ","P1-N400491":""That's awful," whatever. Wednesday at work I was like not feeling great. I mean, I still had a huge lump on my head, my nose was hurting still and I couldn't figure out what was going on because it was like basically swollen and bruised all throughout here. And I didn't equate that with like the possibility ","P1-N400492":"of being broken. I don't know. I just didn't really think about like how it couldn't like go both injuries when I fell probably. [00:14:05]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: "...he's probably going to need to do an adjustment."
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: So...
THERAPIST: Like the break was in your nose?
CLIENT: Oh, yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Fracture right here.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:16:07]
CLIENT: And... So I went in on Monday. He took me first thing on Monday because he must have seen that I needed it or whatever. And I was stuffed up. I was so stuffed up and there was just so much pressure. Like the whole... It was just so much pressure. And he explained that's because of how it fractured ","P1-N400611":"and it fractured to this side. And so Jillian came with me which was really nice. And this ear, nose, and throat guy like really experienced, great. Like I'm really lucky with the hospital and all the doctors and stuff. Like literally, pushed it.
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: And he was like I don't know... Some people say this really hurts. I don't know, you know." And so I was like, "Okay." And he like just took his hand and it felt like he was just pushing really, really hard. I felt a lot of pressure. And he was like, "Okay. Look at it." And me and Jillian looked ","P1-N400651":"at it and we were like, "It still looks like a tiny bit more crooked." And he was like, "I can go a little more. You know, it's just because..."
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:16:57]
CLIENT: "You don't know. I think, yeah, it's, could go a little more." So he pushed more and like I really, I thought it would hurt more. And the I looked and then my nose was straight.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: And I'm like very conscious of it and he said that basically I might notice in like a month a small bump develop and I might even kind of feel what he's kind of talking about right here. Because I guess like when he pushes it some bone growth can happen and that if it gets really bad and I want ","P1-N4006D1":"it removed, they can go in and actually do like shaving down but then it won't... Whatever. But other than that, he said I probably would be fine with my sinuses and no problems internally so that's really fucking lucky.
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: And it stung a little bit and it's still sore and I have to be careful with it but it like feels... The next day I was like, "Oh my God. I feel so much better."
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So that was really awesome and I'm really lucky and then... So let's back up. So I don't know if it was simply that I overdrank, that there was some sort of chemical reaction with the Benadryl that I had taken, that I have some sort of allergy or intolerance, you know, that is manifesting itself ","P1-N400751":"in these blackouts or I don't know what. [00:18:11]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Last night I saw Steph pretty much for the first time since it happened. We were like doing, hanging out at my house for Valentine's Day. She actually almost ditched me. (LAUGHTER) She actually almost ditched me to go to Aidan's which is really fucked up because she was like, "Oh, I want to ","P1-N4007D1":"hang out with you because I don't want to hang out with Aidan. It's too loaded." [00:20:05]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So anyway, then she's like claiming, "I'm going to go home. I'm tired. I can't do this." And I was like, "Okay, that's fine." But I was like, "Lucas, you tell me if she's at your house." But then she like felt bad because our friend Raph (ph) who was also supposed to go out with us, I guess ","P1-N400831":"I had to, he ended up with his daughter so he couldn't go out and then Steph... So she came to my house. I don't even remember how the conversation started but I basically said something to her something along the lines, you know, like, "I should have been taken to the hospital that night. Like I wish ","P1-N400832":"I had, you know?"
THERAPIST: Right. [00:21:05]
CLIENT: And she like immediately got really defensive and confrontational basically taking it as a huge insult that I had also said, "But, you know, it's water under the bridge and I'm just glad that I'm okay and everything is fine now."
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: She got insulted at the fact that I was suggesting... She thought it was an insult because I was basically suggesting that she didn't do the best thing.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: She's didn't like the idea of water under the bridge because that means there is some water that should be under the bridge. She felt like, "Oh, what have you been harboring all this anger about this whole thing this whole time, ever since da, da, da," yelling at me.
THERAPIST: Huh.
CLIENT: Like yelling at me in my house yesterday. So finally I started crying and I was like, "Steph, like, I'm really sorry this fucked up thing happened to me." "You weren't even there. It happened to all of us." I was like, "I know I wasn't there. I know it happened to all of you and I told you all ","P1-N400931":"a million times over thank you and how grateful I am and like everything, for everything that you did. I'm not saying that you didn't do it right." She's like, "But you're saying that if you would have taken me to the hospital?" And I was like, "Kind of, yeah." And she was like, "No you wouldn't! You ","P1-N400932":"wouldn't have known. We just thought you were really drunk. We didn't know. Jillian didn't tell us that you fell and hit your head. I didn't know. We did our best." [00:22:03]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: "Shut up. Like Jesus Christ. Do you have to be a fucking lawyer all day, every day of your life in and out of the office?" It was just... I understand that she felt like she was being accused of something but I was trying to explain to her that I wasn't accusing her of something.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I was simply saying what on my mind and that I wanted her to respect that and I'm sorry that it came out as an insult.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But this is what I felt. And I felt like I should have gone and I didn't and it was... Thank God I was okay. I mean, if I had a concussion, I could have ended up in a fucking coma. They just let me go to sleep, you know?
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And I fell on marble, like granted there was no blood. I wasn't walking. Like, "I've seen you drunk like that Trina. We just thought you were drunk." I'm like, "You've never seen me that drunk, Steph. I've never pissed myself. Like I'm sorry. Like as drunk as however you all were also... Like ","P1-N400A51":"as drunk as I could have been, I would have fucking seen that as a red flag." [00:23:03]
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: So we did... It was like everybody you had to. But we were already in the process of, "We need to take her to the hospital. Let's go in a cab." Like, whatever. I was... And I was drunk and I was... That's what you fucking do. If somebody is unconscious drunk, you take them to the hospital. I ","P1-N400AB1":"don't care how... And then she started saying, "Well, I thought you'd be mad because then maybe your mom would find out and then maybe you'd get hit with a hospital bill." I was like, "A fucking hospital bill? I work for the fucking university. What that..." She was like, "Oh so you thought about it?" ","P1-N400AB2":"I was like, "What? No. You just brought it up. I didn't think about it at all. You think regardless of the hospital, but you think I would be fucking pissed at that? No." I mean, bottom line. I mean, bottom line... And I mean, Raph really sparked this whole these people are fucking idiotic high schoolers. ","P1-N400AB3":"Because he's thirty seven. I told him the story. He couldn't be at my birthday because he was sick. [00:24:05]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But they could have... I mean, I could have gotten fluids. They could have taken blood to make sure I didn't get fucking roofies. Like they could have checked my alcohol level.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Like all of this stuff that would have helped me put the puzzle together later.
THERAPIST: True.
CLIENT: You know, they could have treated my head. I didn't ice it because I was all traumatized. I didn't ice it until the next day.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: I mean, they could have told me, "Your nose is probably broken, Like it's deviated," like all of this stuff is why it was appropriate for me to go to the hospital. And I, you know, and it is water under the bridge. I'm not saying it as like a bitchy, "It's water under the bridge." It's like ","P1-N400BD1":"it is what it is. I'm alive. Everybody's safe. Thank you all so much. Like I bought Jillian flowers because honestly she did the most work. [00:25:05]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Jillian was like, "I wanted to go home."
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: "Like, I was supposed to go home, you know?" Like she had actually told Philip not to come because she was like, "No, no. I'm going to, I'm going to be able to come home so don't worry about it."
THERAPIST: Right. [00:27:03]
CLIENT: So and basically like until my nose got fixed, I've been just kind of like feeling like shit and dealing with trying to figure out like why it happened or maybe there's no why. I know why but just like... I don't know.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I wonder why you got so trashed.
CLIENT: Right. And I mean, again, like Steph's convinced that it's like the Benadryl and the Benadryl and some sort of intolerance that I have. She was reading up on like alcohol allergies and intolerance and thinks that's maybe the case. And was trying to be like... And even last night, she was like," ","P1-N400D11":"Trina, I really think you're putting too much like blame on yourself for it. I don't think it was just that you drank too fast." And I was like, "I don't think that it was just that I drank too fast, no. But I think that that was a huge contributor. I think that if I hadn't drank so fast the issues ","P1-N400D12":"of mixing alcohols, you know, like various kinds of alcohols and taking a Benadryl wouldn't have..."
THERAPIST: Right. [00:28:03]
CLIENT: "...had that effect if I had just drank less." And so, well, yeah, I'm not putting all the blame on me because I think there could have been some sort of chemical reaction. I don't know. Maybe I did get fucking roofied. I don't fucking know. Like obviously. Because I've never been... That's ","P1-N400D51":"like never... I've thrown up. I've blacked out. I've been, I've been tipsy and falling over, you know?
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I've never not been able to speak. I've never not been able to walk. I've never been carried anywhere. I've never pissed myself. I've never woken up in the morning with a hangover and not thrown up.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know, I've never taken falls like this. So, you know, in that way, yeah, I don't know. There is some unclarity about what...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...you know, what my alcohol level actually was compared to if somebody came by because people were stopping by the table. We... I don't know. Maybe I was trashed and somebody could have put... I don't know. I wish I had gone to the hospital and found out but it was too late by the time I did ","P1-N400E11":"so, so be it. [00:28:57]
THERAPIST: Strange too because you had been, when we talked that Friday, you were feeling great.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: Like...
CLIENT: And I was feeling great and like...
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:29:41) about all this Texas stuff and excited about it and pleased that things were happening so quickly and that you were finally going to do this thing that you had wanted to do and felt like you sort of finally having the confidence to do in a way. [00:29:59]
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I wonder what's going on there. I mean, in other words, it's not as if you were in a bad place, you know?
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And wanted to sort of obliterate it.
CLIENT: No. It wasn't... I mean, I've had those nights recently.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: I haven't even gotten this fucked up on that.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: On a kind of emotional fueled...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...drinking binge or whatever, you know? This was purely like I wanted to have a good time.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I was having a good time. I was looking good. I had a new outfit on. My hair was cute. I ate enough during the day. Like I was... I drank enough water. I mean, I was chilling. Like...
THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: I was really excited that the club was fun. The music was really great. Friends were coming. Like... (PAUSE) And I'm really... Like it ruined... Like I missed my birthday. It sucks.
THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. [00:30:51]
CLIENT: I mean... (SIGH) And I, and the whole like not drinking thing is like more because I don't know what happened because I wasn't drinking because I was depressed or anything. Like and then I'm scared. I'm scared to have a glass of wine. Like... And now when I think about it and I have a couple ","P1-N4010F1":"glasses of wine and my face turns red and I don't think about it because it's just always happen. Now I'm like, "Fuck. Well maybe I can't. Maybe I can never drink champagne again or maybe that's what did it because also I drank champagne on New Year's and I got really fucked up even though that was ","P1-N4010F2":"more like, "Fuck this," you know. Like maybe it's the mixture of everything so I don't. I'm scared. I'm just totally rattled, you know?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I mean, I guess it's... I mean, it makes me feel good that like I'm not like, "Oh, God. I really want a drink. I really want a drink," and drank that mojito and wasn't like, "Mmm. Yum. Nevermind I'm not scared anymore. Like... You know? That's good and I feel pleased about that. And I don't ","P1-N401131":"think this is like an, "I'm going to be done with drinking forever," thing. [00:32:01]
THERAPIST: Not necessarily.
THERAPIST: I mean, how much had you been drinking generally. I mean, I've been hearing about it mostly, you know, in episodes like this but more toned down where you drank more than you...
CLIENT: Intended or wanted?
THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, had you been drinking much during the week?
CLIENT: No, not at all. I mean, a few weeks ago, I drank too much wine with my friend on a weeknight. But it wasn't like a home alone like... And I haven't been like having drinks at home. Like I haven't...
THERAPIST: Do you have drinks with dinner usually?
CLIENT: Like if I go out to dinner or at home?
THERAPIST: At home?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I mean, with Franklin when I (inaudible)
THERAPIST: (inaudible) you're at home for dinner.
CLIENT: Mm hmm. Yeah ordering freaking pizza. They don't deliver alcohol.
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) [00:34:03]
CLIENT: And I'm sure as hell not going out.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I mean, no. (PAUSE) And I mean, if I do it's like a glass of wine or two.
THERAPIST: Maybe what we're talking about is more like a binge than it is like alcoholism.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: In other words, maybe the sort of the symptom here is kind of tending to do a binge.
CLIENT: Right. Which is what I'm kind of relating to my mother's always fat.
THERAPIST: She apparently had both, yeah.
CLIENT: I mean, I don't want to behave that way though, you know. I don't want to be binge drinking.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:34:57]
CLIENT: I mean, when I was waiting... Actually, coincidentally enough, when I was waiting for the guy to adjust my nose, there was like pamphlets. You know, there was like pamphlets. One of them was like, like, "Don't binge drink," like, "Don't over drink."
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And like how many drinks you should have in hour many hours for your weight and if you're a woman... I was like, "Okay, well, I definitely don't really adhere to the one drink per hour thing if I'm out.
THERAPIST: Right. And that...
CLIENT: And I guess I want to distinguish for myself more of a line between going out and having drinks and getting a little bit tipsy and going out and having drinks and getting drunk until the point where you're in bed until two PM the next day with a huge headache. [00:36:01]
THERAPIST: Right. And also I think often not feeling all that great about...
CLIENT: Having drank that much.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Absolutely. And I read that pamphlet and I was like, "Okay. Average is one to two drinks an hour." I'm going to slow that down to one drink per hour and a half or two.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, I think that's the part where like, sure (inaudible) drink like that, that's great and it's good to sort of know the...
CLIENT: But can I?
THERAPIST: Yeah. I think the sort of the bingeing is kind of a little in your personality where you kind of get anxious and keep things sort of clamped down pretty tight most of the time and are sort of work hard and are on top of things and responsible and so forth. Like... And then you kind of let ","P1-N401651":"loose. You know, you're sort of, you're blowing off steam or something like that.
CLIENT: Right. [00:37:01]
THERAPIST: And that's where the bingeing comes in. In other words I don't think it's like a random thing you happen to do. I think it fits in with an aspect of who you are and what you're like somewhat.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: It doesn't mean you have to change everything to change this.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I think it's part of that. You know, I can imagine you, in fact, if I think about it, you know, it relates to what we were talking about on Friday. You know, you were excited about this stuff. It's a lot of pressure (inaudible) You're thinking of moving and getting a new job. You're nervous. ","P1-N401711":"You're keeping on top of finances and work on job locations and thinking about moving and feeling sad about Franklin and your birthday.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: You know, where you want to be and all, all that stuff. I mean, I guess it's all stuff that you can kind of worry about or be kind of stressed out by and these are more hard to manage and keep on top of and the you just, you know, blow the lid off. [00:37:59]
CLIENT: Right and, you know that also, you know, another thing I think could be adding to it especially recently is that I'm so bored with my job. Like I'm so bored out of my skull...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...with the work that I'm doing on a day to day basis.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But then it's exactly that. Like, "Oh go blow off steam, like go crazy," because I'm so fucking bored every single day like day in, day out, same old shit, go home, be alone, eat some pizza, like go to sleep. Blah, you know, like go to work the next day and do the same motherfucking events every ","P1-N4017F1":"single week for the last three years. So I think that adds to kind of this behavior recently especially with the break up and the whole thing. I mean, it's all a combination but I mean...
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, in a way, like aside from finding jobs and moving, you don't have a lot going on really.
CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. So I really...
THERAPIST: And that's kind of depressing.
CLIENT: Yeah and so in these nights it's like, "Oh I'm out. Let's take advantage and go buck wild." Like I don't know why that equates to drinking too much but it does. It's like the binging thing. It's like the...
THERAPIST: Well it's part of dealing with being kind of a bit depressed in a sort of agitated way. [00:39:05]
CLIENT: Mm hmm. Right.
THERAPIST: I don't know if you're super depressed but...
CLIENT: Yeah, but enough.
THERAPIST: ...feeling a bit empty.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: You're kind of agitated and, and this is one way it comes out and I guess...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...like that part is sort of hard to make contact with. So you don't...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...get aware of feeling that way.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Even though you're kind of acting in a way that demonstrates that you do.
CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. That's a good point. [00:41:01]
THERAPIST: And...
THERAPIST: Yeah. (PAUSE) I was thinking about it. Like... (PAUSE_ Yeah. I'm also... I'm not sure what that's about. Is it about getting out of your head? Is it about drama? Is it about kind of obliterating what you feel? I don't know.
CLIENT: Yeah, me either.
THERAPIST: I mean, you know strategically... (PAUSE) You know, sounds like strategically it's fairly straightforward, you know, making sure you're not drinking too quickly and maybe telling people you're going out with at times when this could happen not to let you drink more than a certain amount.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: But it doesn't explain kind of what's driving it. [00:43:59]
CLIENT: Right. Exactly. And for me that's more important like than the strategic side of it...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...because I can do that. Like clearly.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But just especially because of my history with my mom and her family and the whole thing I would just really like to not... I don't want to be using this strategy that I have now as like a for now thing and not concentrate on the maybe why I was doing it or why I have the tendency to and then ","P1-N401C51":"later have it creep back up on me or something. I don't know. I've been so terrified about being an alcoholic all of my life. Like just out of sheer like I don't want to do that. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, I don't think that's what we're talking about is that you're getting close to being an alcoholism. I think it's more an issue of kind of like damaging behavior and stuff.
CLIENT: Right. [00:45:07]
THERAPIST: Which is a bit... Which is important but a bit different.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And I can totally understand your having that fear. (PAUSE) We should stop.
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: I enjoyed talking with you.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Sounds good. (inaudible)
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: Okay. Alright. Have a good weekend. Thank you.
THERAPIST: You too.
