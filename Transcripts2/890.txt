TITLE: Client "S", Session November 19, 2012: Client has gone from being excited about her recent break-up to being upset and saddened.
DESCRIPTION: Client has gone from being excited about her recent break-up to being upset and saddened.
CLIENT: So (inaudible at 00:08) this weekend.
THERAPIST: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
CLIENT: Like, I feel like I left here I was just on Friday, like, in general just, like, feeling pretty good, blah blah blah. And then, like, I went out Friday night and Saturday night and, like, drank too much. So then both days I was, like, sleeping for hours. And, like, I don't know. It was just, ","P1-N4000F1":"like, crappy and, like, I don't know, maybe, like, hanging with Stephanie, who's also dealing with her breakup isn't a good idea because then we're just both like [sob fest] (ph), like, I don't even know. Like, not good.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 08:48)
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Right. I'm, like, now my roommate's boyfriend's going to be here for a week. Great. And, like, Thanksgiving is like, do I call him and say happy Thanksgiving? And is that what people do? I don't even know. I feel like it'll just, like, be rubbing salt in his wound or my own. ","P1-N400271":"(pause) And then his brother's girlfriend, the girl that's, like, giving me some advice, Naomi, like, texted me like, "Hey girl. Want to hang out sometime?" Like, no. Why would I want to hang out with you and, like, see pictures of your kids that look exactly like Franklin (sp?)? Like, no, thanks, I'm ","P1-N400272":"all set. And I don't even like you. I don't even know what you're talking about. Why would you want to hang out with me? It's nice. I mean, I wouldn't say that to her obviously. Like, it's nice, it's fine. But, like, no. (laughter) I don't want to hang out with her really. What are we going to talk ","P1-N400273":"about? We don't have anything in common at all except for the fact that we were both dating one of those brothers and now we're not. [00:10:11]
THERAPIST: I would imagine that (pause) you're (pause) irritated (pause) about how upset you still are.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know if it's even irritated. Just, like, I don't really know how to, like, deal with it.
THERAPIST: Well, you sound pretty irritated about the things that you remind you of it.
CLIENT: Well, yeah. [00:11:15]
THERAPIST: You know, like, the guy at (ph) the other night, the girls at the end of the table who were like the girl Franklin (sp?) would look at on Facebook. (pause) And then you go to work (inaudible at 11:40) sort of invitation from Naomi (ph). (pause) I guess my impression is you're irritated by ","P1-N400331":"the way those things kind of poke at (pause), you know, how you're feeling hurt and upset and lonely.
CLIENT: And also I guess it's, like, another part is, like, no matter how much I'm, like, distracting myself and trying to keep busy or trying to (inaudible at 12:27) it's just I do things that are different or just distract myself. Like, there's always going to be things that, like, I don't know, just ","P1-N400351":"remind me or, like, just make it, like, make me have to deal with it more than just, like, going out and getting drunk and club. Like the mattress and like the cute text.
THERAPIST: [That sounds lonely] (ph), like you miss him.
CLIENT: That's, like, the annoying part. Like, I miss him but, like, I don't because I'm so pissed at him. (pause) I miss him but, like, I'm so angry at him that I don't and well, I don't want to be dealing with his shit so it doesn't I don't miss his bullshit. (sniffles) But, like, now I'm used ","P1-N4003F1":"to it. I'm used to having him there. I'm used to having somebody there. it's, like, now I don't have it anymore and it, like, sucks to get used to something like that and then (sobbing) get unused to it. [00:16:17]
CLIENT: I'm, like, yeah it's that, like, me and Stephanie, like, have each other to talk to and stuff right now but at the same time it's kind of hard because, like, I'm trying to deal with my own stuff and she's trying to deal with her own stuff so, like and then when we get together we're both just, ","P1-N400431":"like, sad about it, like, with the same stuff but different and whatever.
CLIENT: And, like, I don't know. Like, I literally am na√Øve (ph) in, like, I don't even know, like, if I'm going to be happy or sad from one second to the next. Like, I don't and then I feel bad if I'm, like, sad. But then I'm, like, not able to change my mood and then feel frustrated at myself ","P1-N400471":"that I can't change my mood. And, like, I think for some people it's hard to think about the bad. Like, when you're missing somebody you sometimes concentrate on, like, "Oh, he was so nice and this and the cats and whatever." But, like, while that's happening a little bit at the same time I am focusing ","P1-N400472":"on the bad and, like, I am thinking about, like, all the bullshit a lot and getting, like, reangry. [00:18:22]
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of it.
CLIENT: (sighs)
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 18:28)
CLIENT: I just, like, want to be, like, pick up and be over it.
CLIENT: And, like, my mom, I know she's just trying to be nice and stuff but, like, for some reason I'm just she's just irritating me. Everything she asks me or says to me is irritating me so I'm, like, worried about Thanksgiving, if I'm going to be, like, depressed and, like, snippy, especially because ","P1-N400531":"I've been trying to hold it together at work and to a certain extent with friends or whatever. I don't really lash (ph) out on my family. But I don't know how I'm going to be feeling on Thanksgiving either, you know. [00:19:32]
THERAPIST: You break up with him on Wednesday?
CLIENT: No, it's two weeks tomorrow.
THERAPIST: OK, still. So we're 13 days out here and you guys were together for two and a half years?
CLIENT: Three years.
THERAPIST: Three years. You've been with your boyfriend three years, with whom you lived for, like, a while.
CLIENT: Like, three years.
THERAPIST: Three years, less than two weeks ago. They may have to put up with you being cranky and upset at Thanksgiving.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think they will. Especially because the past two years I haven't stayed there the whole day with them and today, I mean, this year is the first evening (ph) I will. (sighs) I mean, they understand, whatever, but my mom, like, still gets all upset at me and, like, yells at me like, "I ","P1-N400631":"didn't do anything. Don't talk to me like that. You can't treat me like that."
THERAPIST: Wow. [00:20:38]
CLIENT: Yeah, like, she said that to me yesterday. And then, like, my phone died, which was good. And then she, like, texted me like, "What happened? I called you back several times." And then I called her back. I was like, "Oh my phone died and then I cleaned my house." She was like, "Oh, OK. Like, ","P1-N400671":"talk to you later." Like, it was fine. But I got annoyed at her. Yeah, I snapped at her for something stupid but, yes, it's annoying that you're telling me not to snap at you right now. Like, don't really? So, like, OK, sorry. Like, thanks for giving me something else to feel bad about.
THERAPIST: What is his first name?
CLIENT: Theodore. (sighs) Friday we met about this big event that's coming up next week. And we, like they wanted to get the video recorded on Web stream and so I'm, like, meeting (ph) to figure this out. And Theodore's asking me what the updates are and I'm explaining them to him and he's, like, ","P1-N4006F1":"looking me in my face, like, is asking me to explain that a thousand times in a thousand ways. And I'm looking at him like, "Are you fucking kidding me right now? Are you really, like, serious about testing my patience?" And he wasn't doing it, like, on purpose. He just wasn't paying attention besides, ","P1-N4006F2":"like, his need to, like, figure out exactly what I'm saying because he can't understand and he doesn't like the answer that they people gave me. I was like, "Theodore, what do you want me to do? I'm explaining to you the situation. I can't magically snap my fingers and get the fucking answer from people." ","P1-N4006F3":"And he was like, "I'm not annoyed at you. I don't like the answer they" and I'm like, "OK, but I'll check back on Monday. I don't know what to tell you. Like, I e-mailed them again today. "Well, did you ask her specifically?" "No, I told you what I just asked her and was waiting for an answer back. ","P1-N4006F4":"I will ask something else more specifically if I don't get the answer I need." [00:23:59]
THERAPIST: Maybe you're annoyed with many of us, maybe including me as well.
CLIENT: Why?
THERAPIST: Because, like, (pause) I mean, in my case, (pause) I don't know. I was, like, waving my arms and fussing for a while about you sort of being (inaudible at 24:23), having trouble seeing things or ending things with Franklin (sp?). Now you did and now you feel like shit. And, you know, I'm ","P1-N400751":"not saying, clearly, people are trying to do this to you but a lot of people are bugging the shit out of you. Pretty much most people, I think.
CLIENT: Pretty much everybody. Stephanie told me not to yell at strangers either. She's like, "Just don't take it out on the strangers." [I was yelling at] (ph) strangers. Yeah, everybody is bugging me. Like, you, not so much. I understand what you're saying...
THERAPIST: Yeah, but it's not so much.
CLIENT: Like, why, you know, whatever link there. Fine, like, I see that and I know that's whatever. But everything is annoying me. Every possible thing. My roommate walking around barefoot the other day annoyed me. Like, it's fucking freezing in this house. Get some got damn slippers. Like, you fucking ","P1-N4007B1":"hippie. Put some slippers on. Like, that annoyed me. Everything.
THERAPIST: Because she was cold?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It made you feel cold?
CLIENT: It's cold, yeah. And she complained about being cold.
THERAPIST: Oh, OK. [00:25:42]
CLIENT: Right. She was like, "Yeah, I was a little cold. Like, all right. Put some socks on."
THERAPIST: So sorry. It annoyed you that she was being in a way like a hypocrite, cold and not putting slippers on, and also just that she was cold in the first place?
CLIENT: No, just that she wouldn't have slippers. Like, who doesn't have slippers?
THERAPIST: [What the fuck] (ph)?
CLIENT: Right. Like, there's no carpet. Who doesn't wear slippers in the world? That was my annoyance. Like, everybody has slippers. Put slippers. I don't know. Maybe that's (inaudible at 26:21) but that's what I'm saying. Like, it's irrational and it annoys the shit out of me. Franklin's (sp?) shit ","P1-N4008F1":"in the office is annoying me. Like, great, now I have to look at fucking suitcases for god knows how long because you couldn't borrow my car or get a ride. And (inaudible at 26:39) because I broke up with you. Oh my god. And his mail. That's annoying.
THERAPIST: Everything [about Franklin (sp?)] (ph) pretty much, one way or another?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, in one way or another, yeah.
THERAPIST: And it's the ways that it's reminding of you of Franklin (sp?) that are bugging the shit out of you?
CLIENT: Yes. Like, the mattress thing has really, like, got me, like, going. Like, it's now like a thing. It's not just, like, "Oh, I have to turn my mattress." It's like an event. I don't even know who I'm going to call. Honestly, who am I going to call to come help me move my mattress? My roommate ","P1-N400971":"gets weird and she's weak and, like, wouldn't understand how to do it because there's, you know, what's it called? Bed skirt. It'll get all messed up if you don't do it right and she's not going to pay attention. I don't feel like yelling at her or explaining it. Essentially I need somebody I can yell ","P1-N400972":"at while they're doing it. Ideally, my lazy fucking brother who does nothing besides, like, wallow in his own... [00:27:56]
THERAPIST: I think it's clear who the ideal person is [to you] (ph).
CLIENT: It's not. My brother?
THERAPIST: Franklin (sp?).
CLIENT: Yeah, it would be, of course. But I'm not going to call him to move my...
THERAPIST: I know, but I guess that's (inaudible at 28:07) the point.
CLIENT: That is the point. It is Franklin (sp?). and that's something that is, like, a two second activity, like, this morning and my bed would be ready to go. Right, that is the point.
THERAPIST: So in that sense, like, he's pissing you off again?
CLIENT: Right. If you hadn't fucked up and fucked everything up. Right, exactly.
THERAPIST: And he'd be around to turn your fucking mattress.
CLIENT: Yes, and do everything else, right. Yes, exactly. And then I start thinking about it and I start thinking like, "God, I can't believe I was, like, giving this whole thing another fucking chance after all the bullshit and all this stuff. And then he's talking to Betty." I was really, like, gung-ho, ","P1-N400AB1":"like, I'm going to move forward with this. I'm going to do it. And then he really took that for granted. Took advantage of it. So then I think about that and get all annoyed about everything. [00:29:19]
THERAPIST: Franklin, Franklin, Franklin (sp?).
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: And (pause), like, annoyance, annoyance, annoyance.
CLIENT: Right. I'm trying to do well on this class but, like, I'm really not feeling so, like, dedicated to it right now, naturally. (pause) And then, like, I feel like, oh, I want to, like, sleep for 15 hours but then I feel like shit if I sleep for 15 hours. And, like, I know it would feel good to, ","P1-N400B51":"like, workout or do something but I don't even want to do my Zumba DVD because, like, he gave it to me. And, like, it sucks. I'm, like, connecting everything. I don't want to stretch because he stretches, like, a lot.
THERAPIST: That fucker's even keeping you from doing the things that would make you feel better.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 31:20)
CLIENT: And then, like, my own questions about how to handle this situation, like, in terms of just, like, going cold turkey, like, never talking again. Like, really? Or, like, how to handle that we do need to because I need to say, "You have mail at my house," or whatever I need to say. Or eventually ","P1-N400BF1":"set up to get his stuff picked up. So do I be nice and, like, say happy Thanksgiving and stuff or, like, say hi? Like, it's been two weeks. Happy breakup anniversary? (pause) Because the responses that he has given me when I have tried to say anything have just been, like, so cold and, like, shut off ","P1-N400BF2":"that it's like, well, I don't really clearly he doesn't want me to say anything to him. So why would I, you know? [00:32:23]
CLIENT: Like, maybe I'm even a little annoyed that, like, the girlfriends that I, like, know and hung out with and whatever for the past three years haven't said anything to me. Like, I think they could have. I think at least his crew leader's girlfriend could have easily said something to me. She fucking ","P1-N400C51":"pet sits my cat. She could have just been like, "Hey, Franklin (sp?) told me" unless he hasn't told people still. I don't really know, whatever. Which would be insane because it's, like, obvious. But I guess if he's not saying anything maybe he doesn't want to talk about it and people don't think, ","P1-N400C52":"but I don't know. That even annoys me. And, like, his family, that nobody in his family has said anything to me. Because in their heads it's probably like, "Oh, she broke up with him. She should say something to us." I mean, who cares. I don't really care. I don't like them, but... [00:35:16]
THERAPIST: I wonder too if (pause) one of the advantages of being with Franklin (sp?) was that you could be annoyed at him a lot.
CLIENT: Yeah. He didn't like it, but he tolerated it. That's true. And not (ph), like, I can't with my mom or, like, work or something.
THERAPIST: Well, I'm thinking [you know how] (ph) to take care of you, I think. I'm not saying he always did (inaudible at 38:38)
CLIENT: Right. But he did, yeah.
THERAPIST: And she doesn't, at least not in the same way. And people at work don't. And nobody probably does.
CLIENT: Like, I don't even know how.
THERAPIST: [So you're being] (ph) annoyed at them (ph) for that, annoyed at him for not being there. (pause) (inaudible at 39:15) ordered in.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 39:19) to tell you where to order from, probably.
CLIENT: I just want to get through this week and, like, have a long weekend. (sighs) I'm looking forward to the reunion on Friday and, you know, stuff. Like, that'll be good. But I'm really not it's these two and a half days of work that I have that are just, like, killing me. I'm just, like, so tired ","P1-N400E11":"of people it's just, like, people asking me for stuff. Everybody wants everything and, like, that's my job but, like, I can't handle it right now, if they don't stop asking me for shit, everybody. I'm not giving anybody anything. Like, "Oh, can we put a rush on finding out on this base (ph) for a ","P1-N400E12":"rent (ph) in April?" Like, no, we can't put a rush on that. Sorry, it's in April. But, I mean, obviously I will but it's just, like, annoying that I'm being asked to. I don't know. [00:40:43]
CLIENT: Stephanie even sent me a message last night that she was, like, "You know you're pathetic when at 9:45 on a Sunday you're looking up on Wiki How how to deal with a breakup." (laughter) I was like, "I looked that same thing up." (laughter) That's what you do. Like, I don't know, maybe Google ","P1-N400E71":"will know. (pause) Meanwhile, as much as I want to move because, of course, the whole apartment reminds me of him and the whole neighborhood and everything, that would be, like, the least prudent thing that I could do in my life right now. Like, it's not going to happen and so, like, that's another ","P1-N400E72":"thing I need to just, like, come to terms with.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 42:41] to all this stuff is, like, that you hurt and that you miss him and you feel very much on your own.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And it seems to me that's incredibly painful.
CLIENT: And it's something I haven't really felt before, so it's hard to figure it out. (sighs)
CLIENT: I will say, like, I was like, "Oh, if I could just have a vacation and, like, I could just feel better." But at the same time, I mean, the fact that, like, I can't and, like, that's not a possibility right now is probably for the best because I'm, like, having to deal with this all. And, like, ","P1-N400F31":"if I went away or did something, like, it would just all be here...
THERAPIST: When you get back?
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: We need to stop for now. So we're on next Friday next week but...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 44:35) would it be best just to wait for that?
