TITLE: Client "J", Session March 11, 2014: Client discusses ongoing financial and communication issues.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses ongoing financial and communication issues.
CLIENT: Good morning. I’m injured, so I’ve been hobbling around.
THERAPIST: Oh, no.
CLIENT: I had it in the past where I just get this like this swelling in my foot that’s really painful and gets all red and, you know, I thought it was gout and I went to the doctor a couple years ago. He said no. And then comes back and it just keeps getting worse. And like stinging pain and ","P1-N4000F1":"then it starts getting like—you know, yesterday I couldn’t even put any weight on it. Or actually two days ago. So, and now my calf is all sore, crampy.
THERAPIST: (inaudible 00:00:42)
CLIENT: So, on Friday I went to pick up the kids. And, you now, Jess’ like, “Oh, do you want me to come over?” I’m like, “You know,”—you know myself. The woman said you know that Jess should drop off the kids. And that I should drop off. You know, I do go to ","P1-N400131":"the bank and, you know, it’s like the first time I wanted to go and actually walk in the square and walk around. And, you know, it’s like oh and get the kids. Lucille does not want to go. And I wouldn’t call it a—I mean, you know, it’s not like laying on the floor screaming ","P1-N400132":"nonsensically, tantrum. But, you know, “I’m not going to go,” crying, screaming, “I’m not going to go.” But, you know. And nothing would convince her. [00:01:47]
THERAPIST: It really hurts (inaudible).
CLIENT: Yeah. You know, I don’t know that it was as much her about that is more kind of big picture of just, you know, I don’t know what’s going on with the kids. It’s not like I talk to them every day, you know. You know, I’m missing most of her growing up. This is a product ","P1-N400191":"of, you know, me not being around, you know. I mean I think it’s—I’m not really hurt at all. I haven’t been hurt yet by anything she’s done or said, you know.
THERAPIST: I’m not so sure. Yeah.
CLIENT: Well, you know, at—for a three year old. It does hurt me when I tell her to shut the front door and she tells me I can’t say that. She won’t shut up. So, you know, I was bummed out. And (pause 00:03:47 00:03:51), you know, I texted Marcia and, you know, I went home. And I ","P1-N4001D1":"was like, you know, she was like, “Why,” you know. And I said it’s—I said basically, you know, when I try and explain these things to her, you know, fact by fact that doesn’t seem to work, you know. One time she asked me why I was—why I wasn’t feeling well. ","P1-N4001D2":"I was like, “Well, you know, I was having problems with the kids,” you know or something. “Ian was doing this,” and under her breath, she’s like, “They’re just kids. You know, kids are kids,” or whatever, you know.
THERAPIST: And what is it that you want to explain to her about your depression? [00:09:01]
CLIENT: You know, well, she wants to know how—
THERAPIST: How to help?
CLIENT: How to act. And I just kind of want to show her—originally, I didn’t want to bring these things up. I didn’t want her to feel bad, you know. But now I want to kind of explain to her, you know, that, you know look me in the face telling me I’m depressed and to get over ","P1-N4002F1":"it or something like that is not a very helpful, you know. But more so (pause 00:09:28 00:09:33) trying to understand why I do something may not make sense, you know. I was going to—told Jess. She’s like, “Why don’t you want to do that? Why don’t you make that one phone ","P1-N4002F2":"call? Why don’t,” you know. It’s like, “I don’t know.” (pause 00:09:44 00:09:48) I don’t know why I was quiet Saturday night, you know. It was well past, you know. Of course, I went and feel asleep, you know. Marcia’s like, you know, go take, you know—get ","P1-N4002F3":"some rest. So, I fall asleep on the couch. And she says she’s up all night all worried, you know.
THERAPIST: Are you asking for advice, Cameron?
CLIENT: I am.
THERAPIST: How about that?
CLIENT: I remember Googling something about this.
THERAPIST: (laughter) Google didn’t help you figure all right. What else can I do? (inaudible 00:10:33)
CLIENT: I mean the reality is, is that, you know, you’re like the only person that I can say things to because, you know, (pause 00:10:40 00:10:46)—I just don’t have anyone. I don’t have a listener in my life, you know. (laughter)
THERAPIST: You might be able to train her a little bit. I mean I understand that she has ADD. And that she sort of doesn’t get what helps or how to help. And that that expectively leads you to not want to talk to her about this kind of stuff. It also sounds like at least at sometimes she does ","P1-N4003D1":"want to help even if so far she really can’t. But maybe that means, you know, she can learn to help a little or help in the right circumstances or something like that. I guess—
CLIENT: But what is help?
THERAPIST: Well, I think what you want mostly is for her to listen and so that she understands that to be sympathetic and supportive, you know. So— [00:11:45]
CLIENT: Because I thought about this, you know. And every time it comes down to doing it I don’t do it. You know, because I really—you know, it’s like I want to make all these points and I realize that I’m lawyering it. That, you know, the fact that, you know, she responds the ","P1-N400431":"way she responds, you know, on a fact specific basis is not important, you know. It’s, you know, getting her to respond, you know. I don’t know.
THERAPIST: But, yeah. So, sure. I mean the kids—
CLIENT: You need some water in your flowers.
THERAPIST: (pause 00:12:27 00:12:45) I mean you can even just tell her like the point is—like the thing that will help (coughing) is for her to hear you out. And to say things that are supportive. Hear you out to show that she’s understood what you have to say and to be supportive, trying ","P1-N400491":"to tell you you’re doing something wrong or trying to tell you that your reactions don’t make sense will inevitably make it worse. So, if, you know, you mention about the kids and you’re obviously upset about it, you know, she can either say, “Well, yeah. That sucked,” ","P1-N400492":"you know. I know you’re feeling lousy or not—more than alive. So, we’re that, you know, “I didn’t feel comfortable with you the other day. Do you (inaudible [00:13:42]). You know, that sucks.”
CLIENT: So, we’re listing the condo. We’ll see how that goes. I mean the sorry the Marcia thing sounds a little daunting. And I don’t know. Somehow, you know, Jess’ 16 years of criminal defense has made her an expert in real estate. So, it’s been fun so far. She doesn’t ","P1-N400511":"understand that this is a short sale that there’s just no combination of circumstances that we’re going to get anything out of it. So, it doesn’t matter what the sale price is. It doesn’t matter how much the broker makes. And again it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter. ","P1-N400512":"It doesn’t matter, you know. It doesn’t matter what you list it at.
THERAPIST: Everything goes to the mortgage company.
CLIENT: Well, no. I mean some is going to be doled out to the realtor and we’re going to hire a specialist to deal with the bank because I know Jess won’t do it. And, you know, the planned attorney fees, so I’ll hire my buddy Phil to do nothing. And, you know, the certain fees, taxes ","P1-N400551":"that you do pay bill. But the rest they just, you know—and if there’s any expense you have it goes to the bank. So—[00:17:30]
THERAPIST: And that’s why none of it goes to you?
CLIENT: Yeah. And I have three appointments tomorrow. One is a woman who showed up at the lawyer for the day, but she really doesn’t have a type of case that the program handles. So, I told her I take it on pro bono as part of the pro bono panel. But I think she’s entitled to attorney’s ","P1-N400591":"fees. So, I’m not going to charge her but, you know, so she should hire me. I’m meeting with a guy in the day—a guy talking about some sort of estate issue. I don’t know if that will end up being a client. But another guy later in the day who needs to do some trust work for his ","P1-N400592":"dad and what not. And I got a woman e-mailing me how she wants to meet with me tomorrow morning. It ain’t going to happen. [00:18:42]
THERAPIST: Do people send things registered or whatever it is? You can tell when somebody got it. [00:25:33]
CLIENT: Well, that’s the worst thing you can do. Because they don’t pick it up. They never got it. You send it certified mail and first class. And that way, you know, it’s hard to prove that you didn’t get it. (pause 00:25:53 00:26:01) I got to send a demand out today and it ","P1-N4006B1":"will go out. Certified mail and regular mail. And I’ve got to get this to Merrimac by Thursday. And I think what I’m going to do is use FedEx two day air. The other option would be like, you know, priority mail with delivery confirmation, you know. But I trust FedEx more than I—and ","P1-N4006B2":"if FedEx fucks it up I know I could drive to the court and do what I did last time it happened, you know.
THERAPIST: I didn’t.
CLIENT: They just miraculously rolled. I mean maybe I ought not to use the word rolled but turned back.
THERAPIST: Oh, I went like that. (chuckles)
CLIENT: (pause 00:28:54 00:29:29) So, like, yesterday I literally drove to Pembroke just to check the mail. I mean part of it is checks, but now with litigation, you know, I’ve got to be seen—I got to see if stuffs coming in, you know. And it’s like today, you know, I’ve got ","P1-N400751":"a—I’ve got to do that motion by Thursday. And whether the discovery comes today or not slightly affects, you know, the success of the motion, you know. (pause 00:29:59 00:30:05) That could be as late as 2:00, but I got to go see Micah at 3:00. (pause 00:30:08 00:30:11) I’m seeing ","P1-N400752":"her an awful lot because of the whole, you know, not taking my medicine. And stuff like that. And then, you know, I’m going to need new scripts for the Adderall. So, I have to go in and make an appointment just for that. (pause 00:30:35 00:30:40) (music) That’s (inaudible). (laughter) (inaudible)
THERAPIST: It’s not my call.
CLIENT: If you’re in a lawyer’s office and you’re meeting with an attorney about your will and that came on.
THERAPIST: (laughter) It would depend who I was.
CLIENT: I like it. Like that was the woman who wants to meet tomorrow morning. So, (pause 00:31:27 00:31:31) I don’t—oh god. (pause 00:31:32 00:31:37) I mean yeah. I really got to get, you know, I remember when I worked for (inaudible) shop in Leicester. My boss was like you need to ","P1-N4007D1":"touch every file every day, you know. And I need to do that. Whether it’s just having a spread sheet and what’s going on and, you know. But I am supposed to be taking over this case and I haven’t even talked to the clients yet. And haven’t read the fee agreement, the complaint, ","P1-N4007D2":"anything, you know. And I feel less guilty about this stuff because I’m like I don’t know—really having a (inaudible). I got plenty of other work, you know. (pause 00:32:25 00:32:32) I want more closings though.
THERAPIST: Yeah. It sounds like that’s still kind of the easiest money.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean if the seller thing works out that would be good. Got a little more easy to do while doing the litigation. But the reality is that refinances, you know, is—court time is, you know 9:00 to 1:00 or 2:00 to 4:00. So, those really—you can work around because refinances you’re ","P1-N400811":"usually (inaudible) them at night. And I can now file from anywhere basically electronically. So, yeah. Squeeze in the closing. So, I’ve been doing more closings. (pause 00:33:23 00:33:27)
THERAPIST: Will that pick up seasonally?
CLIENT: You would think. You know, there was this surge and then just judging by—you know, I still have some people, you know, going under agreement and looking and what not. But I have zero title examination orders right now. And one is a very busy attorney and the other one does, you know—it’s ","P1-N400851":"Phil. So, he’s been doing more than me lately, so I can’t say he’s a schlub (ph). But so, you know. I don’t know if that doesn’t bode well or not but, you know. (pause 00:34:16 00:34:34) Did you download the new operating system update?
THERAPIST: Nope. I haven’t.
CLIENT: Most unbelievable feature on the calendar where you can just kind of go to the list of some of the—you know, who are we missing? And you go into the calendar and it’s got this little—
THERAPIST: You can make a list of your things?
CLIENT: Thing up there. Yeah. So, but you could go—you could always do that, but you couldn’t do it right from the screen. I think, you know. So, you don’t have to go scrolling through 24 hours of appointments. Boom, there’s—here’s the stuff I got to do today at one ","P1-N4008D1":"time, you know. But working all day that’s fucked up. So, (pause 00:35:20 00:35:25). I got to sign up for spring league tomorrow and I have to tell this guy I’m like five to five. You guys are going to have to wait around for about ten minutes because I have to sign up for spring league. ","P1-N4008D2":"So, now one—move in on my fucking office, but, you know—
THERAPIST: Is it because the checks aren’t—
CLIENT: What’s that?
THERAPIST: Is it because the checks haven’t been coming in? Is that why you’re waiting?
CLIENT: No. I went ahead and told them to go ahead because I thought some money was coming in. And I don’t have to worry about paying my—you know, the contractor right off the bat. But he hasn’t been to LeTip in two weeks. And, you know, Patricia always says, “He’s on a ","P1-N400951":"business trip,” or something like that. I don’t know. But he’s sick or something. But, you know, I got three appointments tomorrow and my office looks like shit, you know. Because that’s the thing, you know, with these, you know—and I’m going to hold steady on this ","P1-N400952":"ground, but these landlord\/tenants are coming to me. [00:36:24]
THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible) things that overall are going pretty well with Marcia. And that business has picked up. It doesn’t sound like you’re having much trouble being motivated in doing stuff.
CLIENT: You know, yesterday and this morning, you know. It was really actually 4:00 that I’m waking up instead of 5:00. I kind of went yesterday—I went home and then just snoozed on the couch for a couple of hours. So, there’s that bit of funkiness, you know. Both were obviously pretty ","P1-N4009B1":"early, but yeah. I just, you know, today I’m ready to get the office and get shit done. Was that this morning? Getting shit done. (burping) Excuse me. (pause 00:38:13 00:38:24) I was a little, you know, what to do about Marcia.. I don’t know. I just figure I’m not going to push the ","P1-N4009B2":"issue until I really need to, you know. I think she realized, you know, she went a little overboard. Unlike Valentine’s Day where I don’t think she realized. I mean she knew something happened, but I don’t think she knew what, you know. (pause 00:38:54 00:39:00) But I was able to ","P1-N4009B3":"be very specific when we (inaudible). I mean I told her that these problems that, you know—let’s not talk about it. (inaudible) 4:00 in the morning, you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean I think that’s great. I think that makes a lot of sense. It seems like that is often when the trouble happens.
CLIENT: (pause 00:39:19 00:39:26) And then it’s like, you know, Laurel who is not drinking, who’s driving. He gave her a ticket, but she still—you know, it’s a huge favor to drive everybody. And it’s the paradise. So, and I even told Marcia, you know, before I even got ","P1-N4009F1":"(inaudible) after the show. And, you know, we’re all walking for pizza. And I’m like, “Where’s Marcia,” you know. And she ended up going into a bar to get a drink, you know, with a friend or whatever. And I was even said—I was like, you know, I barely see you, you ","P1-N4009F2":"know, all night, you know. And then we’re going for pizza and number one, it’s uncool for Laurel who says no drinks, you know. Let’s go. And, you know, spending time with me, you know. I went to get pizza, you know. [00:40:24]
THERAPIST: (inaudible).
CLIENT: I have a feeling I owe you an extra quarter in there. (pause 00:43:29 00:43:35) I’ll just deduct that from the invoice. (crosstalk). (pause 00:43:39 00:43:52) I’m sure there’s other stuff, but you know.
THERAPIST: Why don’t you finish up now? (pause 00:43:57 – 00:44:13)
