DESCRIPTION: Client discusses a vacation he recently went on and how angry he was throughout the trip. Client discusses some stressful dealings at work.
CLIENT: Got in from Louisiana last night. Oh no…
THERAPIST: Before we get to that. Let’s see, scheduling for the next couple of weeks. So I’m in next Tuesday. Are you around next Tuesday?
CLIENT: Probably, yea.
THERAPIST: Okay. I’ll see you at our usual time next Tuesday. I’m not in the following Tuesday, which I think is the 31st, but I am in some other days that week. Are you around that week?
CLIENT: Yea. I got nowhere to go.
THERAPIST: Okay. You want me to e-mail you if I can do something else?
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: Okay. [00:01:00] (pause)
CLIENT: (clears throat)
THERAPIST: Go ahead.
CLIENT: (sighs) Yea, so I woke up yesterday. It was like 80 degrees. It was 5 this morning. I really don’t care. People are getting off the plane whining about the weather, waa, waa, waa, (mumbling). I thought it was kind of nice, you know? Crisp, cool.
THERAPIST: She may as well be poking ya.
CLIENT: Yea. I got frustrated very easily this weekend, you know? [00:10:05]
THERAPIST: Uh-hum.
CLIENT: Micah wanted me to take Abilify. I didn’t really understand what I was supposed to take. I go see Dr. Billings (sp?) because I have this thing on the top of my head that Marcia is like oh, you know.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: (clears throat) He’s like (mimicking) “Well, you know that got this thing called the telephone you can pick up and call Micah and, it’s like—(sighs) I don’t know why, but calling Micah is a pain in the ass. It’s just a pain in the ass. It’s like calling ","P1-N4003B1":"you. Do you ever answer your phone? No, because people call you while you’re talking to people, working right? And you’re running late, so you’re not trying to call them back between, you know, patients. So, after you put the kids to bed, you’re like “Oh shit,” you ","P1-N4003B2":"know, “I didn’t text Cameron back and tell him when…”you know, I mean. You’re laughing, but that’s how it goes doesn’t it. [00:11:01]
THERAPIST: (laughing)
CLIENT: (sighs) I’ve got a fucking President’s meeting tonight at fucking 5:30 in Salem. You think this guy would have some sense of just like, hey let’s not make you drive to the fucking meeting in the fucking snow. This isn’t that important. I’ve got to drive all the ","P1-N4003F1":"way down to Watertown. It’s like, maybe I can see if Patricia will go to the meeting, I don’t know.
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: Patricia. My Vice-President. See if she’ll go because I don’t want to get stuck in all the snow. I’ve still got to go to the office today. Because hopefully there is money waiting for me and supposed to be in court tomorrow, but the status conference and [00:12:15] this dickhead ","P1-N400431":"accountant is, you know, duh. The woman who is trying to get a conservatorship on my client’s mom. Her doctor is on vacation till the 5th, so the doctor can’t do a medical screen yet. He sends me an e-mail, like he’s trying to educate me. (mimicking) “Well, it doesn’t have ","P1-N400432":"to be a doctor. It can be a nurse practitioner, (making arrrr noise.) I said, “Unlike you, I don’t tell people how to do their jobs.” If I don’t have a medical certificate today, yea, I’ll call them, what’s going on? But he sends me an e-mail about continuing. (mimicking) ","P1-N400433":"“You [00:13:02] know, I don’t know if my clients are going to be happy and be willing to change the hearing. They’re going to want your client to explain why you don’t follow your obligations.” So I replied to him, I said “Well, as you know, the doctor was out of ","P1-N400434":"town.” I said “Her grandmother died a week ago and I’m currently on a pre-scheduled trip. That’s what I’m going to tell them. You can tell your client that’s what I’m going to tell them.” The response was a proposed Motion to Continue. It’s like, ","P1-N400435":"just be civil, you know? I’m just (grunting noise) [00:14:22] (pause).
THERAPIST: Yea.
CLIENT: I got the jet lag or whatever lag or depression or mood issues. For some reason my shoulder is hurting. I keep talking about my hand. I need to go to the chiropractor. I don’t feel like going to the chiropractor. I don’t feel like doing anything. Completely [00:17:12] unmotivated. ","P1-N400491":"That’s why I’m thinking this conservator shit is not working. We go to the restaurant. The woman tells me the list of sides. I couldn’t remember a single one. I knew potato and French fries and veggies because that’s always included on the list. I mean literally, when she finished, ","P1-N400492":"I’m like, “Can you repeat that?” (pause)
THERAPIST: Oh gosh.
CLIENT: In his sleep. A young guy.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: I kept asking them what happened and they haven’t said anything yet, but they’re have a memorial in the morning on Friday and funeral to follow and then they’re going back to their house. Ian has a junior chorus concert. Well it’s not a junior chorus concert. It’s ","P1-N400531":"everybody in the fucking school concert, so who knows how long I’m going to be there. There’s 1st grade, 2nd grade, you know. Of course it’s all going to suck, but you’ve got to go. [00:19:01] (pause)
THERAPIST: See you’ve got to leave the kids alone, Cameron.
CLIENT: I get in the face of a 5-yearold girl, “Are you going to cry? Come on, cry.” (chuckle) I don’t know why I do this stuff.
THERAPIST: Umm. Are you feeling like a 5-year-old girl Cameron?
CLIENT: I’m not feeling like a 5-year-old girl.
THERAPIST: Everybody and everything getting in your face?
CLIENT: I was in her face, but…
THERAPIST: But everything else is in your face. Everybody’s poking you. Everybody’s giving you a hard time. Everybody’s making your life…
CLIENT: The flight was delayed. I yelled at the lady.
THERAPIST: There we go, yea. Yea, I think, I think you’re the 5-year-old girl and everybody is getting in your face.
CLIENT: Can I be a 5-year-old boy?
THERAPIST: Whatever you like. [00:21:02]
CLIENT: You drive to the airport. Everything is on time. Incoming flight from the islands, on time. You get to the airport, it’s now a half hour delay. So we go and get something to eat. So instead, it’s supposed to be—the delay was to 6:00. We get to the gate at 6:10 . What’s ","P1-N4006D1":"going on. What’s going on. We go up there and it’s now 6:35. So I went up to the woman and the plane has been there for 45 minutes. Based on the schedule of the incoming flight and the schedule of the outgoing, our flight, and boarding, it came to about a 20 minute turnaround and it’s ","P1-N4006D2":"been there like 45 minutes. So I was like, “Why is there a delay?” She’s like “The plane came in late.” I’m like, “Yea, but like the plane has been sitting there for 45 minutes.” She’s like “Well we’ve got to turn it around.” I ","P1-N4006D3":"said, “That takes you 20 minutes.” She’s like “No, no.” I said “Listen, I know it takes you 20 minutes. That’s how the schedule is set up.” She’s like “Well, [00:22:22] we’ve got to, we’ve got to let the ground know and we’ve ","P1-N4006D4":"got to set a time.” I said “You set three different times and now you’ve got to wait till 6:35 because someone went to the bar and they’re drinking and they’re not going to show up till 6:32. So we’ve got to wait for everybody now.” I said “Why do you ","P1-N4006D5":"pick 6:35 when you know it takes you 20 minutes to flip around the fucking plane.”
THERAPIST: Yea.
CLIENT: My step-brother, Drew, he’s like “Ahh, I got the most offensive joke in the world.” I’m like I can top it.” “What’s your joke?” He’s like, “A pedophile goes in the woods with a 4-year-old kid. Kid starts crying, ‘I’m scared, ","P1-N400791":"I’m scared.’ The pedophile looks at him, goes ‘you’re scared? I’m the one that’s gotta walk out of here alone!’” (chuckles) So my [00:26:25] joke, which tops that (chuckles) is “What’s better than sex with a 4-year-old? Nothing.” (chuckles) ","P1-N400792":"I know it’s sick, but it’s still funny. “What’s the opposite of Christopher Reeves? Christopher Walken.” (chuckles) (sighs) [00:27:23] (pause)
THERAPIST: I think there’s something that is kind of a release about the pedophile jokes for you. Like, you’re really not that bad (chuckling).
CLIENT: I like them because they really bother people. Some people laugh, but other people are like, ohh, you know?
THERAPIST: But I think you knew that wasn’t going to really bother me, you know? [00:28:07]
CLIENT: I knew it wasn’t bothering Drew. I mean, you know? I know Marcia doesn’t like them. I’m not going to tell her my new pedophile joke, unless I get really drunk. (pause)
THERAPIST: I think, with a lot of the stuff you’ve been saying, I think you’d rather be an asshole than vulnerable. You would rather tell the story about being mean to kids than talk about how every little thing is driving you fucking crazy.
CLIENT: I think I told you about both of those.
THERAPIST: Yea, you have, but I think you gravitate to the former to get away from the latter.
CLIENT: I can’t remember which one you (inaudible) Mean to kids…(small pause)
THERAPIST: It’s easier to make the 5-year-old girl cry than to stay with how some [00:30:20] little kid is really getting to you by calling you a sucker head.
CLIENT: She wasn’t getting to me.
THERAPIST: Oh yes she was.
CLIENT: I got to use my joke, I don’t suck, I lick.
THERAPIST: Why did you throw her on her face?
CLIENT: To shut her up. Because her parents wouldn’t shut her up and Flo…
THERAPIST: Yea, you needed to shut her up because she was getting to you. She was getting under your skin.
CLIENT: And Flo is like telling me how disciplined her son is with her and I’m like “Yea, they both just sat there. They told her to stop saying it once.” The first time Ian [00:31:04] said it, I would have been all over him and if he had said it again, I would have said, very loudly, ","P1-N4009B1":"“I just told you not to say that” and he wouldn’t say it again for at least an hour.
THERAPIST: I wonder if you’re telling me that I’m a very lax parent and I should be really getting on you for (chuckling) lots of things that you’re saying (chuckling) and getting you in line.
CLIENT: I’m beyond help in that regard. You’re going to tell me I’m not, but…
THERAPIST: Well, no, I think you wish you were. I mean I think, you know, you often do this. You, like…
CLIENT: You know I didn’t come here for you to put me down (clears throat.)
THERAPIST: Is that what I’m doing?
CLIENT: It sounds like it.(chuckling)
THERAPIST: (chuckling)
CLIENT: Go ahead, sorry. [00:32:02]
THERAPIST: Yea, you decided that I’m the responsible grownup and you’re going to do whatever and then my job is to like, waggle my finger at you and tell you to behave. (pause)
CLIENT: (yawn, sigh) I’m going to agree with that, but I don’t know if it’s because I’m just being stubborn or. [00:33:12] (pause) (slapping sound)
THERAPIST: Not a scream mask.
CLIENT: Not the hockey mask, maybe it’s the Mike Myers mask, I don’t know, one of those. The whole pull it over your head kind of—and he walks out and he stands in one of [00:34:42] the cars. There’s these two girls who are supposed to go sit where he’s standing and they ","P1-N400B51":"just scream and run off. (laughs) Ian was like, (inaudible) (laughs). Which I, that’s fine you know? (pause) (yawns and says fuck). [00:35:28]
THERAPIST: What?
CLIENT: “Too late, I already put it on Facebook.” I told my dad, I go “You and Mom have me now in a lifetime of therapy. It’s only fair that I put Ian in a lifetime of therapy.” [00:37:14]
THERAPIST: (Laughing)
CLIENT: (singing) “Houston has the Oilers…”
THERAPIST: (laughing)
CLIENT: I remember as a kid, we’re outside the Orange Bowl or (inaudible) Stadium, I don’t know. A Bills fan— we’re all waiting in line to get in and start singing that. By then the Dolphins had bought the rights back. I was just like, man, there’s just no comeback to that, ","P1-N400C71":"you know? So every time they would play that, Ian was like (singing)”Houston has [00:38:18] the Oilers” (laughs) But none of the Dolphins fans, I think a lot of them don’t get it. My step-brother Drew, he got it, and he was like that’s so old (mumbles).
THERAPIST: Yea.
CLIENT: What a poser.
THERAPIST: I think that’s why you like me.
CLIENT: Someone without sight? (moves around) Maybe I’ll see if I can get Patricia to go to the meeting tonight because I have to go up to Pembroke, and I would rather go now and come back for Micah instead of wait for Micah and then go up to Pembroke and then get up to Salem in a fucking snow ","P1-N400D31":"storm. There’s not going to be a lot of snow, but just the traffic to get to Salem and then to get down to Watertown . Or if I leave at Watertown from Micah’s or shortly [00:40:18] thereafter.
THERAPIST: Yea.
CLIENT: No one gave me the option to do something different. Then I’ve got to call Honda because this guy is going to say, (mimics) “Well you know, for $1,000 we’ll re-key everything.” Still—if I was close to my oil change, I would just take it to Andover [00:43:13] Honda ","P1-N400DF1":"and ask them, “Hey, what the fuck?” And they probably would be more than happy to tell me that Boch fucked up. Sure every Honda dealer will like, just stick it to Ernie Jr. It’s like one more thing you know? It’s like I’ve got all these one more things, I just can’t ","P1-N400DF2":"keep track of them.
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: Whew. So we’re on next Tuesday, but not the following Tuesday.
THERAPIST: Thanks for the heads up.
CLIENT: Yea, anytime.
