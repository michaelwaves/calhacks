TITLE: Client "R", Session March 12, 2013: Client discusses her feelings for her therapist, how his support helps her feelings of abandonment.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her feelings for her therapist, how his support helps her feelings of abandonment.
CLIENT: Hi.
THERAPIST: Hi.
CLIENT: How are you?
THERAPIST: I'm doing okay.
CLIENT: I saw your emoticon.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: Is it a friendly ghost? I guess that makes sense.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:00:53)
CLIENT: Why you would send me a friendly ghost?
THERAPIST: Oh, it was just sort of like, "Boo. Hi." [00:01:01]
CLIENT: I don't have a friendly ghost in my emoticons.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: This is going to work.
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) [00:01:57]
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:01:59)
THERAPIST: It should go... Yeah, there you go. [00:02:03]
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:02:05)
THERAPIST: This one's better on my phone.
CLIENT: Aren't they the same.
THERAPIST: They are but that one looks like it's getting stuck a little.
CLIENT: No, I should learn to use this one.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:02:27) How's it going? (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Going fine.
CLIENT: I was wondering what makes a good session for you.
THERAPIST: Hmm...
CLIENT: Alight. I'm not trying to judge my meditation sessions. (PAUSE) (inaudible at 00:02:57) It's hard with a daily practice to everyday have it, have some strong opinion about it. [00:03:07]
THERAPIST: You on the stairwell kind of here?
CLIENT: Mm hmm. Like this is the theater. (PAUSE) I'm sorry but it is. You seem to want to be like the other parts of the world for me.
THERAPIST: I guess I think it's... (PAUSE) It seems to me important that I fit the reactions to being here that you tend to have here (inaudible at 00:06:53) But it seems to me...
THERAPIST: ...fail you.
CLIENT: Yeah. I think it's a problem. (PAUSE) I don't know why. Maybe sometimes I have expectations that I didn't know about or realize or something bothers me that I can't, that I don't know about when it happens. [00:08:07]
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: I also noticed that I couldn't really remember why it felt so badly to have sex with Jeremy (ph) that night and I think this has come up before. [00:08:59]
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: I mean, I am happy. It's great being there. It's not like I shouldn't be there. But I don't think I have a very balanced or realistic memory. (PAUSE) I remember anxiety a lot but I don't remember pain or sadness a lot. (PAUSE) I think I remember anxiety too much. Like I'm a lot of times, not ","P1-N400691":"so much recently, but fear of anxiety is like (inaudible at 00:11:03) [00:11:05]
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I'm not sure what to say yet.
CLIENT: That makes a good session for you?
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:13:25)
THERAPIST: Um... (SIGH) (PAUSE) Yeah. I don't tend to think about it like that.
CLIENT: I don't like thinking about it that way either. (PAUSE) Sometimes I do. Like half the time probably.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. (PAUSE) I imagine it can feel reassuring and nice to have you feel like you had a good session.
CLIENT: Mm hmm. [00:15:01]
THERAPIST: Um...
CLIENT: Yeah. Like, "Yeah, that was a good session."
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: My mom used to say that she could tell what like experiences or actions were good bets for me and my brother based on our faith coming out of that (inaudible at 00:15:37) that it was a real obvious (inaudible at 00:15:51) probably like the emotions on my face are. [00:16:03]
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: I think the prizes are the positive, the very positive emotions. I think I should go to bed (inaudible at 00:16:43) It's just an interesting like way to check in with yourself.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:18:15) It turns out like you had given me tickets that weren't paid for but they were heavily discounted. So they were six dollars instead of like... (PAUSE) I like the number seven, seventeen, twenty seven, fifty seven. I had five dollars with me.(inaudible at 00:18:49) Somebody ","P1-N4009B1":"had a dollar coin right behind me in line at the gate and I was like on the ground looking through my wallet for more money at this point. [00:19:07]
THERAPIST: I was thinking about (inaudible at 00:19:15) for today.
CLIENT: In the dream?
THERAPIST: Sorry. No, no. When you asked (inaudible at 00:19:31) that's actually what was on my mind and I wondered if that might be a hard thing to sort of talk about or anticipate. [00:20:01]
CLIENT: I think it's hard to anticipate. (PAUSE) I mean, it's not hard to anticipate how reassuring it would be to set up a time to talk while I'm gone. Like already I can immediately tell that would be reassuring but I'm not sure that's something I'm going to want. I think I'm also looking forward ","P1-N400A51":"to a break. (PAUSE) it's also just wrapped into the leaving my structure altogether and it's not clear to me what aspects of the structure are going to be hard to leave.
THERAPIST: I have a take on it. One is I think it is hard to implicate what it's going to be like in that to me it seems like it will be bad. You say that weekends are bad and this is longer, quite longer than that.
CLIENT: But it's not like a weekend in that... So say your other thought.
THERAPIST: The other thought is... Sure. I'm... (LAUGHTER) I don't want to keep bringing up the bad feeling and I'm wondering...
CLIENT: That's your job. [00:22:05]
THERAPIST: Really?
CLIENT: Yeah. I think it's your job to bring up the bad feelings.
THERAPIST: Huh.
CLIENT: Well, you do it.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: It's not the only part of your job. If I were to offer a description of your job, it would be... (PAUSE) ...to love and care for me.
THERAPIST: And that means bringing up bad feelings?
CLIENT: In a different way. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) [00:22:57]
CLIENT: I did mention in the list of reasons why I think we're actually compatible the fact that I think you're good at your job. I think that's important to me. It's an attractive quality. So you are good at bringing up the bad feelings.
THERAPIST: Well, I think I was particularly today (inaudible at 00:23:39) Maybe what you are... Maybe what you're wanting today and what you imagine would help with the break is to have a really good session that was clear that we both felt was really good and that would help you to sort of feel connected ","P1-N400C91":"in a way you could take with you. [00:24:11]
CLIENT: Yeah. I think that's right. What's scary about the weekends that's different from this, I think, is that the weekend is like... (PAUSE) (SIGH) It's like trying... Like I have to constantly figure out how to make something that doesn't seem fresh, fresh and like galvanize and like work hard to ","P1-N400CB1":"find the good parts... I mean, I have a very wonderful life. [00:25:01]
THERAPIST: Hmm. On your way back? [00:28:59]
CLIENT: Yeah. That I wouldn't ever get home. I remember talking to my mom on a, like sitting on a curb. You know, there was like sewage everywhere and kids and pigeons and just like holding my phone and like my head and just like explaining how I knew that the plane was going to crash.
THERAPIST: I think... (PAUSE) I think that like terrible upset, worried...
THERAPIST: Part of it feels like it's not going to make contact again ever with the people in your life.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:30:25) ruminating quality that is like really present when I think about you is this constant checking to make sure that you're still there. (PAUSE) I don't have that with all the people I'm close to. It's not... I don't think it's a universal way that I interact with (inaudible ","P1-N400E31":"at 00:31:03) Maybe it's a type of interaction that does repeat. [00:31:05]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:31:41) about how I like seem to want you to have stairwell feelings here. I guess one way to explain where I'm coming from on that is to say like I'm concerned about that one. Like for when you have those feelings or those sitting on the curb like talking to your mother convinced ","P1-N400E91":"your plane's going to crash. [00:32:15]
CLIENT: There's something about being by myself that changes like my emotional accent or something. I don't think it's just... I don't think it's your presence necessarily. I think if there was someone else in the stairwell, I wouldn't... It wouldn't be like, "Oh man. I'm going to show all this emotion. ","P1-N400EF1":"I need to hide it." It just wouldn't come. [00:33:15]
THERAPIST: Yeah. (PAUSE) I'm kind of personifying that aspect of you but that is the one who seems to feel (inaudible at 00:33:47) that the rest of you sort of isn't so clear (inaudible at 00:33:57) or before you leave for a trip. [00:34:03]
CLIENT: I think I felt that I (inaudible at 00:34:05)
THERAPIST: Absolutely. Yes. Definitely. (PAUSE) But I really don't mean to say by that I don't think you have...
CLIENT: What do you want to do?
THERAPIST: What do you?
CLIENT: I don't know. (LAUGHTER) It's kind of like a good question that I haven't experienced. (PAUSE) Like maybe we could have like a mock stairwell experience and I come back in the room or maybe we could spend more time (inaudible at 00:35:53) That seems too... You know? Like being alone a bit. [00:35:59]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:36:01) stairwell today.
CLIENT: Um... (PAUSE) I think I'm really bad at predicting it. Like I mean, it feels bad and I think I'm going to feel full of thought. (SIGH) I also might feel like I didn't breathe very well here which sometimes is the case. I don't breathe well in here.
CLIENT: I don't know why I'm so (inaudible at 00:37:55) [00:37:57]
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:39:05) also why I... (PAUSE) ...keep wondering if I should keep seeing (inaudible at 00:39:19) (PAUSE) I think there's something about like feeling like I have a choice that is really important and actually most of the time I feel like I don't have a choice. (PAUSE) Like this ","P1-N401111":"thing was born and like I need to care for it and like see what happens to it and I share it with you and I can't just abandon it. [00:40:05]
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:41:15) asking for it when I want it. but that's just an observation.
THERAPIST: You have a concern there's something going on whereby it's harder to feel connected where you feel more abandoned or like I'm just not there when you feel certain feelings? [00:42:15]
CLIENT: Does it make sense? So like when I feel more supported by you, I think about abandonment less.
THERAPIST: Less. I see.
CLIENT: Not I feel less abandoned by you.
THERAPIST: I see. (PAUE) When I'm more supportive you think less of like, "Maybe I just want to get out of here."
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I think (inaudible at 00:43:05) [00:43:07]
THERAPIST: But somehow the supportive part is also very important.
CLIENT: Yeah. It's tough but it's sometimes like I said earlier, it, I mean...
THERAPIST: It sounds like it's really hard.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:43:51)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:44:25) Should we finish up?
CLIENT: I don't know if I should ask (inaudible at 00:44:45)
THERAPIST: Think about it and let me know. It's fine with me.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:44:57) [00:45:01]
THERAPIST: Yeah. I think that's (inaudible at 00:45:11)
CLIENT: Do you have an idea of what might be helpful?
THERAPIST: I have many ideas of what might be helpful. I mean, okay. I think I misunderstood the gist of your question which was less like... Yeah. you want to know what I think you should do.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: We'll go from there.
CLIENT: Alright. Bye. Thanks.
THERAPIST: I hope you have a good trip.
CLIENT: Thanks. Have you been?
THERAPIST: I have a long time ago.
CLIENT: I'm super psyched.
THERAPIST: Cool.
CLIENT: I don't know how much time (inaudible at 00:46:35)
