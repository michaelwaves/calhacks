TITLE: Client "J", Session November 27, 2012: Client was recently sick and in pain over the Thanksgiving holiday; he believes he is suffering from Gout.
DESCRIPTION: Client was recently sick and in pain over the Thanksgiving holiday; he believes he is suffering from Gout.
THERAPIST: Nope.
CLIENT: That's always been there?
THERAPIST: For a while now, yeah. I think I hadn't turned it on often, so that's different.
CLIENT: Different lighting.
THERAPIST: Different lighting, yes.
CLIENT: So I think I have gout.
THERAPIST: Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that.
CLIENT: On Thursday I started getting some tightness right here, right by the two toes next to the big toe. I didn't think much of it. It started to get some pain in the muscle and, you know, I didn't even bother taking Advil or anything like that. It wasn't that bothersome. Then I went up to have Thanksgiving ","P1-N400191":"with Tracy and Kai, and the pain just getting worse and worse and worse.
THERAPIST: Oh no.
CLIENT: To the point that it was excruciating in the middle of dinner.
THERAPIST: Really?
CLIENT: And so we went back to their house after dinner, which was very good, and they had some pain medication. Kai had just had a back problem, so I took some of the pain medication. Kai and I went out in the Louisiana room and smoked cigars and I proceeded to get sick, throw up Thanksgiving dinner.
THERAPIST: Oh, that sucks. From the combination of the pain medication and the cigars?
CLIENT: I guess, I don't know. But it helped a little bit, but still my foot had swollen up and had gotten all red around here.
THERAPIST: A history of gout, yeah.
CLIENT: My grandfather had gout, my brother has gout. My brother, I guess he's never had an episode but he has elevated uric acid levels.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: So he takes medication for that. Tomorrow I have a doctor's appointment where they're going to prescribe me more medication.
THERAPIST: What does it mean? What are the implications of having gout?
CLIENT: I have no idea. It's just —
THERAPIST: Is it likely to show up in other places besides your -
CLIENT: It could again, if it shows up in the joints. It's possible that it's caused other pain.
THERAPIST: Yep.
THERAPIST: (chuckles) Well, you're laughing.
CLIENT: I'm laughing because you're laughing. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: (chuckles) Oh, okay. I guess I can at the same time, you know, see how it's different when you have a dog and you're going for a walk with the dog.
CLIENT: You have to do it. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Right. You have to do it and you have some companionship. And on the other hand how like actually, yeah, you can go for a walk without a dog which of course kind of hadn't occurred to you.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) But it looks like with the IRS, according to our lawyer who I just sent $2,500 to — but actually he's saving us a lot of money.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: The plan was supposed to be for 60 months and they're lowering it down to 24.
THERAPIST: Wow, that's great.
CLIENT: And the only caveat —
THERAPIST: That means you just get to stop paying after 24 months instead of having to do the other 36?
CLIENT: Yeah, right.
THERAPIST: That's great.
CLIENT: The caveat on that is that they want an update of all our accounts, and they want an updated letter from you from the letter we had submitted, the old letter you had written, the To Whom It May Concern letter. I don't know if you remembering writing that letter.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I have a copy of it.
CLIENT: So obviously I was in worse shape back then when you wrote that letter. I couldn't ask you to write the same letter.
THERAPIST: What —
CLIENT: But there's a chance our payment is going to go up because I've made more money in the last six months than I was the prior.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I don't know exactly what your letter is going to say, but —
THERAPIST: What's the point of it?
CLIENT: I think they just want to know where I am, you know, mental health wise.
THERAPIST: Like they're using it to assess what your payment should be?
CLIENT: My ability to work.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: I imagine it's kind of a big picture kind of background, you know. They just don't want to say "Oh, they're going through a short period of hardship," and then all of a sudden I could start making a ton of money again and get out of paying all these taxes.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: So they're going to eliminate money we owe. At 60 months we were still paying 30 percent, 30 cents on the dollar. So there's a real chunk we're, you know. (pause) So, you know, I'm sure that's — they want some other documentation from us as well.
THERAPIST: And when do you have to submit everything?
CLIENT: By the middle of December.
THERAPIST: Okay. If I get the letter to you next week, you should be good.
CLIENT: Yeah. Just pay attention to the negative side. (pause)
THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, I take it that you are what I would consider in better shape than you were before, and anxiety and depression do continue to affect your ability to work, so on and so forth. I think, [and I don't know how else to say this], but if you had more business, you could be doing it. ","P1-N400911":"I mean, I don't think you're maxed out in terms of how much —
CLIENT: I seem to be making a lot of mistakes.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: Especially with titles.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: I've had a couple with Phil where I've forgotten stuff or missed stuff.
THERAPIST: Yeah, you get anxious and, yeah, I mean you've talked about some of the mistakes and (inaudible).
CLIENT: Major anxiety, which sometimes I have.
THERAPIST: I have no problem saying that you're continuing to suffer from a major depressive disorder which is how I have you diagnosed.
CLIENT: Just change the date. (pause) And change the timeframe.
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: Yeah, but I'd appreciate that.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: I don't know that I'd be able to handle the increase in payment.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: We've been making payments on it already, so we're already into the 24 months.
THERAPIST: That's great. That would be a real burden lifted.
CLIENT: I can't remember how long our payment plan is with the state. That might be 24 months too.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Good stuffing.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Mashed taters, squash and a salad bar. The place shook when the trains came rolling in.
THERAPIST: Oh really.
CLIENT: It's like literally right on the platform of the train station. Pretty reasonable too. It was pretty reasonable.
THERAPIST: That's great. Where was it?
CLIENT: It's right by the train station. The Depot (inaudible at 00:12:48). In fact, Jess and I used to have a gift certificate. They own a series of restaurants like that or something.
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: I'm not sure how — I've never done Groupon.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I don't think you have to go with other people who buy the Groupon. (pause)
CLIENT: So we have a 5:30 flight on Saturday down to Louisiana. Next Tuesday I'm going to be in Louisiana.
THERAPIST: Okay. You're here on Friday but not Tuesday.
CLIENT: Earlier on Friday, yeah. (pause) I've talked Jess into taking us to the airport.
THERAPIST: You and Ian (sp?), right?
CLIENT: Yeah. Because it would be like 125 bucks to park, you know. Ian (sp?) is my wedge. Obviously if it was just me — if it was just me, I'd take the bus, you know. (pause) But we would have to leave for the airport at like 4:15. The house is only like 15 minutes from the airport. Probably ","P1-N400E71":"that time of day even less.
THERAPIST: Is he pretty psyched?
CLIENT: Yeah, he's excited. He's got so many things going on, though. I mean, the kid has got it pretty good right now, you know. He's got skating. He loves the skating. But I don't think he was feeling that well on Saturday. He doesn't want to let go of the crates because he can go faster with the crates.
THERAPIST: Is that like you push crates to help you keep —
CLIENT: Balance yourself, yeah.
THERAPIST: She did okay?
CLIENT: What's that?
THERAPIST: She did okay?
CLIENT: Yeah, she was fine.
THERAPIST: That's great.
CLIENT: Though she wouldn't say it in front of me, the night before she was saying "Do you love dada?" and she'd go "Yeah." And then you can ask her in front of me "Do you love dada?" and she'd go "No." I'd say "But dada loves you." And I asked if — Jess's father is Grampy — "Do you love ","P1-N401051":"Grampy?" and she says "No, Skippy" who is Jess's mom. So I don't feel so bad.
THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm. You mean, during the time you're away?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: You never know. Something can always come up last second, but I already gave a heads-up to my broker and he hasn't mentioned any. (pause)
THERAPIST: That's okay.
CLIENT: I don't want you running overtime. Did I break it?
THERAPIST: No, I've never even see that, whatever you hit.
CLIENT: Oh, that happens on mine too. I'm not sure what I hit but all of the sudden it's like on a weird screen.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)
CLIENT: Yesterday was a very crazy morning, I guess because of the long weekend. I got a lot of phone calls and just didn't want to deal with any of it. My normal Monday morning anxiety. Came home really early from the office and didn't do any — I mean, I made some e-mails and some stuff but didn't ","P1-N401271":"really do any work.
THERAPIST: It's a little mysterious what's making you anxious, huh?
CLIENT: Yeah. I think it's the Wellbutrin. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Could be.
CLIENT: Definitely idle time. I mean, I'm anxious right now.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Definitely — (pause)
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:22:15)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What pops in your head?
CLIENT: I don't know, just thinking about what happened yesterday. I fell asleep on my couch around 4 or 5:00, woke up at 11. Saw that I won the week in Fantasy Football.
THERAPIST: Congratulations.
CLIENT: Clinched the playoffs.
THERAPIST: Nice.
CLIENT: So that was very satisfying. This is the league that means the most to me. The most money is involved, but more importantly the most status, you know.
THERAPIST: (chuckles) I see.
CLIENT: I mean, hey, I made the playoffs.
THERAPIST: Right, say what you will.
CLIENT: Yeah. Because only six of the 12 teams made the playoffs.
THERAPIST: I see. So that means you're in the top half.
CLIENT: And last year's champion lost five games a row to miss the playoffs.
THERAPIST: Wow. (chuckles)
CLIENT: So there will be some good taunting apparently.
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: The commissioner puts out an e-mail every week, so this should be a good week. But he texted me. He had the highest score, and I had one guy left. My guy just blew it up, scored like 28 points.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: So he was texting me in the middle. I woke up and saw his text. That's how I knew I won. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: Because they were angry texts.
THERAPIST: Uh huh. (chuckles)
CLIENT: So I just texted back dollar signs. It's 50 bucks. He gets 25 for second. (pause) I probably get a little anxious about Fantasy Football, I don't know. Less anxious now that I'm in the playoffs in this league. I don't care so much what happens in the other leagues. It would be nice to win them, you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like what you're worried about with Fantasy Football isn't that you have to win. It's that you don't want to be made fun of.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, yeah, I guess. It's not that — it doesn't hurt me to be made fun of. But obviously your ability to make fun of other people is based upon, you know —
THERAPIST: (chuckles)
CLIENT: Let's just say the guy in last place ain't making fun of nobody, you know.
THERAPIST: Uh huh. You don't want to be that guy.
CLIENT: Because the people who don't make the playoffs play for the Toilet Bowl. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: I see. That's the bottom —
CLIENT: And there's some prestige in winning the Toilet Bowl. I think you do get money for winning the Toilet Bowl, a small amount. But you don't want to be in the Toilet Bowl. (chuckles) So I don't think I'm afraid of being made fun of. But the ability to have some sort of comeback, you know. When ","P1-N401811":"the first guy in first place makes fun of you, you know, it's tough to really —
THERAPIST: Yeah, what are you going to say?
CLIENT: So you just make fun of his heritage. He's Irish. They guy who won it last year was Irish.
THERAPIST: Like literally a professional golfer?
CLIENT: No, but like works at a golf course.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: Which would be a nice job, better than being a lawyer. I don't know how much longer I have to do this crap. (pause)
THERAPIST: So would you say your anxiety then relates to wanting to stay out of the Toilet Bowl?
CLIENT: There's some anxiety there, yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) It does sound like it may have something to do with shame, like with work. Part of what makes you anxious is that you're not going to get it all done, you'll make a mistake. You'll look bad.
CLIENT: I don't know. Is that low self esteem?
THERAPIST: I guess it's related.
CLIENT: You afraid to make a diagnosis? (pause) Or do you just lack the appropriate information?
THERAPIST: You mean to make a diagnosis of low self esteem?
CLIENT: Right. I mean, is that something you would diagnose? But what if someone had low self esteem, wouldn't you want to work on that? (pause) I started reading an article about psychotherapists branding themselves. It said —
THERAPIST: In the Times?
CLIENT: [That may have been right on top].
THERAPIST: [I think that may be part of it].
CLIENT: And I started reading it and it was so fucking boring.
THERAPIST: (laughing)
CLIENT: I couldn't make it past when she started talking about what she was doing to brand herself. I can't even remember what she did to brand herself. (pause) Starting to get my social network back up and running.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: Change the Facebook page to [inaudible] Attorney at Law Facebook page, and change the name of my Twitter account. Trying to put things on LinkedIn and tweeting, all that stuff.
THERAPIST: Well, what do you think about your self esteem?
CLIENT: I don't know. I don't think any — (pause) I mean, it's lower now than it's been in the last year. I feel like — I don't feel like things are going to work out for me, you know.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: It's like I figure at some point this string of business is going to run out, things like that. (pause) News to you?
THERAPIST: News, yeah, absolutely. I thought you were feeling a little more momentum.
CLIENT: I am, but I always have that just, you know, sort of fear thought in the back of my mind that at some point it's going to run out. (pause)
THERAPIST: Do you have any other thoughts about it? (pause)
CLIENT: I guess there's some anxiousness around that.
THERAPIST: One thing is that it's a pretty interesting answer, to my mind. I mean, the question is about self esteem, right, which is how you view and feel about yourself, right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But —
CLIENT: I'm old, balding, fat.
THERAPIST: You think of what will happen with business and being worried it will go south.
CLIENT: It's a success thing, you know. Whether I'm successful or not is the —
THERAPIST: Right, it sounds like we're on the same page in that maybe how you feel about yourself is awfully closely tied in to how things are going. Do you know what I mean?
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)
THERAPIST: I mean, I could imagine it would suck, it would be stressful if business dried up, you'd have to figure out what to do. It would be bad in a lot of ways. But that wouldn't necessarily be so immediately connected to how you felt about yourself in that maybe you're doing everything right, maybe ","P1-N401F11":"these things just happen, maybe it's seasonal, whatever. Maybe it doesn't reflect badly on you. But I think it probably very much feels like it does or would, were that to happen.
CLIENT: Yeah, well, I always felt that way, you know. You've always got to project this persona of success, you know, when networking and whatnot.
THERAPIST: I guess you're also saying that you're projecting an image of success that's tied up in how successful you actually are and how good you feel about yourself?
CLIENT: I don't know. I've never had that success that I expected. Maybe except for when I was working in a firm and making good money. I probably felt better about myself.
THERAPIST: And without that feeling of success, you feel crummy about yourself?
CLIENT: I don't know that I feel crummy but, you know, it's something I think about.
THERAPIST: What?
CLIENT: Whether I'm successful or not [or being unsuccessful].
THERAPIST: I mean, how much does that affect your sense of like —
CLIENT: I don't know.
THERAPIST: I mean, look —
CLIENT: I haven't thought about it, you know.
THERAPIST: Low self esteem just basically means feeling crummy about yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I don't know if you had a different idea in mind.
CLIENT: No. I just don't know that I've really thought about it, you know.
THERAPIST: Well, what comes to mind?
CLIENT: I don't know. Ice cream.
THERAPIST: [What about it?]
CLIENT: (chuckles) I was thinking of just coming up with something random.
THERAPIST: That's okay.
CLIENT: So I actually came up with something random.
THERAPIST: What is it?
CLIENT: Ice cream.
THERAPIST: Oh, ice cream. I thought you said high school.
CLIENT: (chuckles) I was trying to be facetious. Yeah, I don't know. Part of it is my age, you know.
THERAPIST: I'm not surprised you turned to food.
CLIENT: I'm not a huge ice cream fan.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But yeah, maybe, there is something to it. (pause) Well, it's hard to think randomly.
THERAPIST: (laughter) I'm not the one who said -
CLIENT: I was.
THERAPIST: Who told you to think randomly, yeah.
CLIENT: I was, but there's always some influence inside, you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah, absolutely. Yes, and usually one isn't aware of it in terms of (inaudible) that's why it can be helpful to free-associate, do you know what I mean?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Why [don't you talk off the top of your head] and we can both be surprised when you say "Oh, I'm just going to say the first random weird thing that comes to my head" it was ice cream. Huh, you know, when you're talking about self esteem and thinking about feeling bad about yourself and haven't ","P1-N402491":"really explored and it's kind of uncomfortable, you think of something good to eat. You could say that is reflective of —
CLIENT: Of what? Of how I eat because I have low self esteem?
THERAPIST: Yeah. When things happen, when you're sort of at a moment where you're feeling overwhelmed and kind of crummy, you sometimes I think, without realizing that this is what's going on, you really try to help yourself feel better by eating something.
CLIENT: I went grocery shopping for the first time, like full-on —
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: — for the first time in a long time because I was eating Subway and McDonalds like all my meals.
THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm.
CLIENT: Or the sandwiches from the (inaudible at 00:43:58) which are horrible for me. So I went out and finally bought groceries. (pause) Juice boxes for the kids. (pause) But now there's food around the house for me to eat when I'm hungry. I didn't eat dinner last night. I had a piece of bread before ","P1-N402591":"I went to sleep. (pause) Slept through [dinner].
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: It was a long weekend.
THERAPIST: Yeah. We should finish up for now.
CLIENT: Yeah. So we do meet this Friday.
THERAPIST: Yep.
CLIENT: Alrighty.
THERAPIST: See ya.
