THERAPIST: Hm.

THERAPIST: Well I'm wondering what's up, yeah.
CLIENT: I don't know what's up. There's something up. I don't know what it is.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I know. I know.
CLIENT: I definitely, I guess I feel on the offensive. I think you're not having replied to my last two e-mails has affected me. Or my last e-mail, my second, my other one. (pause) Yeah. (pause)
THERAPIST: Uh. I wonder if you're feeling like I'm not quite here in some way. [00:06:54]
CLIENT: You've said that too many times.
THERAPIST: Hm. (pause)
CLIENT: It's hard to, um But it was my first reaction to that question. My second reaction is, is that true? (pause) Yeah, I guess you, I guess it feels like you are in a different phase or something. (pause)
THERAPIST: Like. (pause) I see, like that I'm doing things a little differently?
CLIENT: Yeah. Or like you could be doing things differently. I mean you keep choosing the one that feels less connected. Why? (pause) You're encouraging or (pause) Enthusiastic or (pause) (inaudible at 00:08:40).

THERAPIST: Ah. (pause) This kind of sucks.
CLIENT: You've also said that too many times, and I don't know that it's doing good. (pause) It does suck and it doesn't suck.
THERAPIST: Okay. And I've said it too many times. Yeah. it sounds like you feel as though you're not getting something. Like what you're getting feels too filtered or processed, and not [coming out] (ph) spontaneously. And nothing is different from before. [00:10:36]
CLIENT: I guess so, yeah.
THERAPIST: And, you know, "What the hell is going on?" Like, I don't know, "I wonder if [that's connecting to patients outside of here]." (ph)
CLIENT: I think I'm feeling -
THERAPIST: Or like, are you feeling like you irked me or shaken me up in some way?
CLIENT: Maybe. Yeah.
THERAPIST: Then I'm then, I may be pulling away is what it feels like?
CLIENT: And like I guess I could imagine that a little bit earlier you would have responded to both of the e-mails that you didn't respond to. The one about wanting to talk to you more. The one on Tuesday. And then the second one last night. And (pause) I think it's fine that you didn't respond. I think ","P1-N400751":"I'm not reacting to that. I think I'm reacting to maybe how you would have earlier. [00:11:41]
THERAPIST: It feels like a change.
CLIENT: Yeah. Or like I could imagine your response and how it would be in the normal things that you've done before. (pause) [It seems like a lack of communication.] (ph) (pause)
THERAPIST: You have not upset me or put me off. Or I don't feel like I'm (inaudible at 00:12:16). I'm not saying like I'm trying just to see what you [observe]. I'm just saying that I'm not aware of any (inaudible).
