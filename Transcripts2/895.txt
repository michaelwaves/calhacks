TITLE: Client "R", Session March 27, 2014: Client discusses therapist-related feelings of attachment, love, and boundary issues.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses therapist-related feelings of attachment, love, and boundary issues.
THERAPIST: Hi.
CLIENT: Hi. How are you?
THERAPIST: I’m all right. (pause)
CLIENT: I’m very sad all of a sudden. [00:00:47] (pause) Like I don’t want to leave or something. (long pause) [00:02:07] I’m disappointed about the sadness because I was so happy. From the moment I left here until the moment I got here. That’s dumb.
THERAPIST: You mean, then, to be sad?
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, really, I got really sad was when I was leaving my house before I got here. [00:03:05] You have a new iPad, too.
THERAPIST: I actually just can’t find my other one, so I snagged this one in the meantime.
CLIENT: I guess that makes sense. (long pause) [00:05:15] I think I cry more easily, too.(long pause) [00:06:04]
THERAPIST: I guess you’re feeling sad about leaving reminded me or made me think of what you were saying yesterday about me and Jeremy and made me wonder if – it’s not like the sadness is new, it’s like being sad about that here, especially before we’re at the end of the ","P1-N4001B1":"hour is new and maybe as (inaudible at 00:07:13) you’re feeling more open about it. [00:07:20] (pause)
CLIENT: The part about Jeremy: what did you think of about Jeremy?
THERAPIST: You had said, among many other things about therapy and me, that one thought you realized you had had about his going to see Sirius Moby or somebody else, is that there are ways that would make him more like me and you would miss me less. [00:08:22] That was pretty close to what you said. ","P1-N4001F1":"I said something like it seems like a good thing to say and it seemed like an open thing to say. (pause)
CLIENT: I don’t [want to go back] (ph?) to my own husband. I come and I see you. (pause) The weekend is for husbands and (inaudible at 00:09:15). (pause) [00:09:25] (crying) And when you’re doing a PhD, the weekend is for drowning. (pause) (crying) Also, doing a PhD makes it feel even more ","P1-N400211":"like drowning, but I think it also forces me to sit with this because otherwise I feel like running off to lots of places and things, covering up the sadness. [00:10:25] (sniffles) But the weekend is for the people that I wish we were. (pause) (crying) Do you have thoughts about rates of tissue consumption ","P1-N400212":"on the couch versus the chair? (pause)
THERAPIST: It seems to me it’s much more (inaudible at 00:12:01). [00:12:04]
CLIENT: I guess I meant the people who use the couch versus the people who use the chair.
THERAPIST: I see. (pause) Overall, the tissues go a little faster over there than . . .
CLIENT: [I think about I would keep my measurement jobs up if I were a therapist. I think I would [miss this] (ph?) a little bit.
THERAPIST: I’m not sure what stuff?
CLIENT: Measuring things, like numbers, observing, keeping track – data, collecting data.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: And I’ve had the thought that billing is like a pretty big part of your regular upkeep in the practice, which has a lot of numbers. There are a lot of (inaudible at 00:13:53) trends to keep track of tissue consumption. [00:14:02] (pause) But maybe you were just concluding that humans are ","P1-N400311":"complicated [and there are no trends] (ph?). (pause)
THERAPIST: Probably some astronomical stuff you could track about when the shades need to be pulled down and [the chair turned around,] (ph?), what time of day. [00:15:01]
CLIENT: You’re not that good at that.
THERAPIST: At what?
CLIENT: At figuring out what shades you want pulled down.
THERAPIST: (both laugh) No, no, I’m not.
CLIENT: That isn’t something that you’ve taken up, it seems like.
THERAPIST: No. (pause) [00:16:08]
CLIENT: There is something about having that fourth session that feels like it has broken something open, like nothing mysterious, things we should start talking about and are talking about anyway. (long pause) [00:17:21] You didn’t sit very close to me. You are sitting over there and you’re ","P1-N400411":"on the big, elevated stool the laptop is on this side on the elevated table. It seems like maybe you were distracted. It didn’t seem like that at all the other day. You were sort of casual and joking, not unlike sometimes how it actually is here. [00:18:03] But that was what it was like for the ","P1-N400412":"whole time and eventually you just got up and sat down and you asked if I wanted a hug and I said yes and you asked if I wanted you to be sitting or standing. It was very sweet. I don’t think whatever was happening last night when I was dreaming, it was like I woke right as you were walking over ","P1-N400413":"here; but I sat down right when you sat down and . . . I don’t know what I was thinking, maybe it was right as you were asking. [00:19:10] But it felt like I woke up momentarily, like for a moment, somewhere like right at the point where it felt that you (inaudible at 00:19:24) and I don’t ","P1-N400414":"know if I rolled through the rest of the dream or if I went back to sleep. It felt like I went back to sleep. I think my answer to the position was sitting, and then also standing up. (pause) [00:20:07] My dream [painter] (ph?) got your face so right. I arrived today and I was very, very, very struck ","P1-N400415":"by how close, how vivid all of your features were. You haven’t been rendered that faithfully in any other dream. (long pause) [00:25:28]
THERAPIST: I’m struck by you saying the word “latching” because I guess that makes me think of breast feeding.
CLIENT: Yes. I had that thought and [I was surprised by it.] (ph?) (both chuckle) But it doesn’t seem like a stretch. Yeah. It was a pretty nourishing dream. [00:28:28] It felt like it had – or it has – the power to fuel me. I think it did. It was kind of cruel, too.
THERAPIST: I’m sorry?
CLIENT: Cool. You thought I said cool? It was a cool dream. At the moment, I’m feeling cruelty more than cool. [00:29:16] (long pause)
THERAPIST: My sense is that you’re feeling so sad, like heartbreaking and gut-wrenching. [00:30:20] (pause) And that it is excruciating, not that we’re in this kind of relationship, but that we’re not in another one and we’re not together. (long pause) [00:31:28] That is what ","P1-N4004D1":"you want and the world is taking no account of it and it’s just awful. (pause)
CLIENT: My dream painter is taking account of it. I don’t know what that dream is. (pause) Is that a (inaudible at 00:32:13)? Or is it like a surrogate? [00:32:20] (pause) [More, I think, like the mother and the breast.] (ph?) Am I trying to fill in the things that you won’t, for myself, ","P1-N4004F1":"by dreaming about it? [00:33:18] Or is there actually a symbol that you have shown things or that we did together yesterday, and that what I dreamt about was as good as what happened? (pause) [00:34:27] Again, this is like what I was saying that, for some reason, I never got to see you again. The dream ","P1-N4004F2":"was sort of moved on in this beautiful state. I know that’s a ridiculous thing to say. I don’t actually know what it would be like, but it’s kind of like coming here is providing whatever – like healing of whatever wound that dream had kind of done. Does that make sense?
THERAPIST: Yes. (pause) [00:35:23] Yeah, the way – I have a couple of thoughts. (pause) First, I want to be clear that I’m not in any way trying to reduce what you’re talking about to this, but I think it is sort of part of the backdrop. It made me think, with the mother stuff, about ","P1-N400511":"your mother leaving you at day care. [00:36:17] I’m pretty sure, part of me is pretty sure, you weren’t ever going to see her again and you’re never going to see me again when you leave. In that way, maybe the dream is supposed to feel that or help heal that and it’s supposed ","P1-N400512":"to help you feel helped or sort of remind you that I’m not as much gone forever as it feels like. [00:37:18] (pause)
CLIENT: Yeah, it’s sort of like that. Now it’s like oh, okay; it’s going to be good; it’s going to be okay. And I sort of worked very happily all day without much worry.
THERAPIST: Those are the other things I thought of, too, but that’s kind of how it feels with you talking about how it wasn’t like you woke up and [we haven’t fucked.] (ph?)
CLIENT: [So fuck isn’t the dream?] (ph?)
THERAPIST: Yeah, or oh, that’s awesome. I’m just going to like sit here and pull out – it was more like . . .
CLIENT: I was tempted to do the latter. There was a moment, but that was kind of short and pretty quick. [00:38:15]
THERAPIST: I think it was soothing, actually.
CLIENT: In contrast?
THERAPIST: No, the dream.
CLIENT: It was like the mother dog dream or that dream about . . . It was like the day before . . . I don’t remember which lab meeting it was. Maybe it was the one in January. [00:39:07] I was pretty anxious about it – I told you about this – and I didn’t feel like I could do ","P1-N400631":"this and that night I dreamt that you were in another room, talking to a young analyst in training and I left that room and went to another room. There was a mother dog and her puppies and she made her puppies go away and had me come onto the couch and was (inaudible at 00:39:54). It has that same power. ","P1-N400632":"[00:40:03] It was the same thing in the morning. It was like oh, yeah, okay. I can go from this bed. I can go from my house to do my things. (long pause) [00:41:56] But the feeling ended and the reality of a not-dream came. (long pause) [00:47:47] Too sad. (long pause) [00:49:30] [It’s too sad ","P1-N400633":"to be here with you and to not be here.] (ph?) (long pause) [00:52:33]
THERAPIST: Okay, so I think maybe adding this session has helped kind of open things up because I think it made you feel like I understood something about how much that meant or would mean and needed another time after you had asked. [00:53:27]
CLIENT: Like how much it would mean to me as a gesture? Or how much it would mean for what’s happening now?
THERAPIST: How much it mattered to you.
CLIENT: Yeah, I’m not sure that I knew why it mattered, but it mattered a lot.
THERAPIST: Yeah, and I think it felt like that landed with me, like I have some sense of how much it mattered and how it mattered. [00:54:12] (pause) I think now you’re not sure how well I understand how sad you feel.
CLIENT: I’m not sure. (pause) [00:55:05]
THERAPIST: And I think that’s what makes it hurt to talk about. (long pause)
CLIENT: What’s paralyzing me is being preoccupied with whether you’re ever going to hug me. (long pause) [00:56:47]
THERAPIST: I imagine there, too, if I don’t come over there and give you the biggest, squeeziest hug ever, maybe I don’t get it.
CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) [01:01:07] It feels like too much. (long pause)
THERAPIST: There’s too much you’re having to do without. (long pause) [01:02:04]
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Like there is too much I have to . . . I don’t know. (pause) It’s too important; it’s too not-happening; it’s too paralyzing. [01:03:08] (long pause) [01:04:09] It’s too scary, like too scary to . . . When I think of what I could do or what I might ","P1-N4007B1":"do if I (inaudible at 01:04:28). (pause) Or like what I want you to do, and, for some reason, it seems to just stay, otherwise I’m saying goodbye to it or it’s going to take over and those are too bad. [01:05:08] (long pause) [01:06:12] It’s also like you’re feeling too much, ","P1-N4007B2":"and that’s too much for you to think about or to wonder about; and you’re too sugary.
THERAPIST: Your sense of my feelings is that they are intense in a way that is overwhelming for you.
CLIENT: Yes. [01:07:04]
THERAPIST: Like the only way to keep something bad from happening is to be very still. (pause)
CLIENT: I guess from saying goodbye to it or to you or something. (long pause) [01:09:16]
THERAPIST: I guess these are things that it doesn’t feel to you like I can make space for.
CLIENT: Yeah, because you’re protecting yourself too much.
THERAPIST: I see. (long pause) [01:10:10] And, in another way, I don’t feel safe with.
CLIENT: Yes. (pause)
THERAPIST: Which leaves you on your own with that.
CLIENT: Yes. (pause)
THERAPIST: I guess a little like what you said about how we should be married, that I’ll either protect myself or that will feel too close for me. [01:11:13]
CLIENT: That I said that, that it’s too much for you?
THERAPIST: I’m saying I imagine that’s sort of something that you also might have felt I might need to protect myself from because it would feel too close for me. [01:11:55] (pause)
CLIENT: Yeah, like it would feel too bad, too sad to you. (long pause) [01:12:40]
THERAPIST: And I can’t show that, so I have to kind of wall it off.
CLIENT: I’m not sure. This is getting elaborate. (sniggers) [01:13:02] I think talking about feeling like I want to be married to you feels like something that you need to protect against, compared to my talking about my wanting to hug you. [01:14:17]
THERAPIST: To me? (long pause) [01:16:52]
CLIENT: I feel completely lost in that. (long pause) [01:17:37] [My sense of self.] (ph?) (long pause) [01:18:57]
THERAPIST: I think you probably feel awfully alone. You’re wanting so much to be so close to me, physically and emotionally – physically hug and just very intimate in a way that I clearly am feeling like I’m not up to. I could imagine you feel like you (inaudible at 01:19:49). That ","P1-N400A11":"kind of makes it .
CLIENT: Yes. [01:20:03] (pause) Like there is no attraction anywhere in the whole world or in this room or inside of you. (long pause) [01:21:13]
THERAPIST: I’m aware that, in the sense, I love you in a way that has some clean-ness to it and that I have to kind of be protective about.
CLIENT: I think maybe that’s presumptuous of me, but maybe I can’t think of another way or like the protection is too strong that, yeah, it seems like that, but I don’t think that’s really the sense of where your protecting yourself comes from. [01:22:07] Maybe it does. I don’t ","P1-N400A71":"know. (long pause) [01:23:12] I guess it seems like it would be too scary for you, but I don’t know why it would be too scary for you. It just seems like maybe you feel scared.
THERAPIST: You’re talking about the hug?
CLIENT: To hug me. Like maybe you could list ten reasons why it’s a bad idea why you wouldn’t do it.
THERAPIST: The real reason would be because I’m too scared and because of how it would make me feel that I don’t want to be feeling. [01:24:05]
CLIENT: I don’t know. Maybe because of how you think it would make me feel that you don’t.
THERAPIST: That I would feel like I couldn’t handle?
CLIENT: Yeah, that you don’t want me to be feeling.
THERAPIST: So in that way, I would be scared for you?
CLIENT: You would be scared of doing something to me that you don’t want to do to me.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: But there is an awful lot of rejection or something, like I’m pretty scared. [01:25:04] (pause) I just feel that it’s so important to me.
THERAPIST: We have about five minutes. (pause)
CLIENT: I’m scared that I dreamt about it. [01:26:07] I’m scared that it’s probably not in my hands or it’s equally in your hands as well as in mine; so I can’t do anything to force it. I can’t wait for it. I just can’t do anything about it except let it go, ","P1-N400BF1":"which doesn’t work because of the first thing, which is that it’s too important. [01:27:17] (pause) And that’s scary that I can’t let it go. (long pause) [01:28:20]
THERAPIST: That’s more than a hug.
CLIENT: It’s more than a hug? You think there’s more to the hug for me? Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So that’s why I can’t let it go? Or because I can’t let it go, you think there is more than the hug? (inaudible at 01:28:52)
THERAPIST: It’s clear it means so much and I don’t think we’re all that clear about what. I mean, in some ways, sure. It’s being close; it’s being held; it’s mutual. It’s out of role. (pause) (inaudible at 01:29:44)
CLIENT: (inaudible at 01:29:46) I don’t know what you think your role is, though.
THERAPIST: It’s not the sort of thing we generally do. I guess I had in mind something like that.
CLIENT: There are lots of things that happen that are not the sort of things that we generally do or feel. [01:30:12] I guess that was the we-against-all-of-you comment. We don’t generally do what you want me to do.
THERAPIST: Oh – I meant you and me. I didn’t mean like me and myself – whatever.
CLIENT: That’s better. (pause) [01:31:19] Yes, we said it’s (inaudible at 01:31:23).
THERAPIST: I said it was kind of like you looked to me taken aback, like I had said something shocking and hurtful maybe.
CLIENT: Yeah, like you think that this is one of those things that I want you to come out role for and I don’t see it that way.
THERAPIST: I see. Yeah, I understand that.
CLIENT: You just fit squarely in your role, given how intense and important and intimate your role is.
THERAPIST: Sure, absolutely. [01:32:30]
CLIENT: Maybe it doesn’t affect your role, like in general, like with other people. It’s not as dangerous, because there’s not an I-feel-so-strongly-about-it-and-therefore-it’s-part-of-your-role, which is not how I want it to be here about it.
THERAPIST: To me there is sense in what you say. [01:33:30] I’ll put it like this and be clear that when one is, like with kids, like when I work with kids, a kid runs over and spontaneously gives you a hug, it makes all the sense in the world that you just do it, you know? So in that sense, I ","P1-N400E11":"think I get what you mean. Yeah, there is a way in which it’s the most natural thing in the whole world.
CLIENT: I think that’s how it feels.
THERAPIST: We should stop.
