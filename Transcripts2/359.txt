TITLE: Client "J", Session February 25, 2014: Client discusses ongoing financial difficulties.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses ongoing financial difficulties.
CLIENT: I’m doing great today. So, and after I saw you two weeks ago, I went to see Micah. And as I was talking to her, she was writing everything down. And she’s like, “These are all symptoms of depression. Take your medicine. Stop drinking,” you know. And, you know, I did kind ","P1-N4000B1":"of focus a little more. You know, we kind of made it so the only thing I have to take at night is the Klonopin, you know. And I think maybe some of my feeling not so well was due to the inconsistency of taking the medicines. And, you know, towards the end, you know, I don’t really remember what ","P1-N4000B2":"happened in the middle of the week. But, you know, like Friday I just—I don’t know. Just, you know, stressed and, you know, frustrated and the kids came over. And I just—really rough time with the kids. And, you know, I was with them forever. At the hockey rink and, you know, I forget ","P1-N4000B3":"Lucille’s snacks. You know, just all this shit was going on. And I kind of took a nap on Saturday. What did we do? Oh, it was Valentine’s Day, so this wasn’t—no. I’m thinking of something different. This was Valentine’s Day. And things were actually—I don’t ","P1-N4000B4":"know. I mean I guess I was probably—
THERAPIST: (crosstalk 00:01:51) this past Friday or something?
CLIENT: Yeah. This was the past—that was like this past Friday. But the Friday before that was Valentine’s Day. And, you know, I definitely wasn’t 100%, you know. I know Marcia kind of sensed it, you know. But went to dinner, you know. Really nice restaurant in Hartford. And we met ","P1-N4000F1":"up with a friend of hers. We had a really good time. And then we got back to the hotel and, you know, first thing I was trying to do—I’ve got the—my little blue tooth speaker was to hook her phone up to it, you know. I’ve had problems in the past and now I kind of realize that ","P1-N4000F2":"my problem is I got to unhook my phone first, you know. So, I was getting frustrated with that. And so, she takes her phone and starts playing it out of the speaker in the phone. And it was like this song, you know—one of these crazy ladies belting it out song. So, she’s like belting it ","P1-N4000F3":"out. And she doesn’t have that great of voice. [00:02:58]
THERAPIST: Google AdWord?
CLIENT: No. This is—
THERAPIST: (crosstalk 00:11:41)
CLIENT: Yeah. This is by laws. You know, people Googling—what people Google to get to their site. So, they take that information and give you what you’re looking for in that directory.
THERAPIST: So, somebody goes find law probate.
CLIENT: Probate. You know, here’s a perfect example. Plymouth trust attorney, you know, (inaudible 00:12:07) attorney, you know. That blue box they might even have the payment on top, but one of the first is going to be the final directory. They click on it and there’s going to be a list ","P1-N4002B1":"of the Plymouth or at least the attorneys of Plymouth. Now the top five spots are paid for spots that are red thing. You click to go to their website and they’ve got something special. These areas not all five of those are sold. And because I cover from Pembroke to Plymouth they’ve got this ","P1-N4002B2":"second tier which basically puts you underneath that, but it shades your name. Now if I were to do this in real estate or some of these other more expensive things, because I’m not that in town guy—the guy in Essex they say he gets like 70 a month. You know, how many of those are—I ","P1-N4002B3":"get a ton of—you know, probably three or four telemarketing calls a day from my website. I was like, “Yeah. You know, what the fuck?” [00:13:08]
THERAPIST: Well, that’s huge.
CLIENT: Sails and everything, you know. You know the purchase and sales side is just picking up. And I think, you know—I mean if I got an inquiry. I’ve had a couple that, you know, haven’t connected. But I think, you know, the ability to lay the groundwork with these tenants and ultimately, ","P1-N400351":"you know, if I can get the chance to meet and talk with them and to explain to them about the security deposit. You know, it’s kind of the same thing with my direct marketing to listings. You know, it’s when they get they offer that’s when hopefully they’re going to hire me and ","P1-N400352":"the same thing here, you know. [00:16:15]
THERAPIST: That’s great.
CLIENT: So, I think that has—
THERAPIST: Like there’s a lot of potential there.
CLIENT: Yeah. And really it’s probably because, you know, this was happening all last week. And you know, it’s kind of one these pinching yourself kinds of things. It’s like I’ve been waiting for this to happen forever.
THERAPIST: (crosstalk 00:17:14) like that.
CLIENT: I think one of the first things that clicked was I had to—like I have to local calls, you know. And I’ve got to get back to people quickly and I’ve got to be sort of—kind of like with e-mails I can—I got to be kind of gentle because I can’t, you know, ask ","P1-N400431":"them questions about their situation. I can’t probe. But, you know, for the money I’m spending I mean, you know, the words are like 30—for the three spots—words I’m buying 80, 90 bucks.
THERAPIST: That’s great.
CLIENT: And every year it’s going to go down. So, I think that just kind of sunk in yesterday of like boom, you know. You know, it’s one of those things the more productive you get the more, you know—so, I was struggling with doing titles and getting work done and wah, wah. Just every ","P1-N400471":"day (crosstalk 00:18:12).
THERAPIST: And the more you—the more work you get the better you know what you’re doing. The easier it is to get it done.
CLIENT: Yeah. And, you know, thinking about things to do to sort of make things work a little easier for me. And my motivation is way up. And, you know, I had a—I can remember a small claims case out in Ware District Court. And he showed up late and it was dismissed. So, we filed a motion to dismiss. ","P1-N4004B1":"I went back out there. And part of—you know, he said that he had to get his granddaughter to the bus, traffic. You know, the distance from Sturbridge to Ware at 8:00 in the morning. Seriously though, this was western mass through (inaudible 00:19:03). Those things get pretty good, you know. (inaudible) ","P1-N4004B2":"and I was trying to get to Holland, you know. So, or Hadley (ph). No parking, you know. And then there was the suggestion—you know, he’s a disabled veteran.
THERAPIST: Well, and also it sounds like you were effective. [00:27:02]
CLIENT: Yeah. And I feel like, you know, the landlord\/tenant is an area that I still need to learn some things and get some things—get some systems in place. I think it’s an area that isn’t crowded like no one wants to put up with these tasks. You know, you—there’s going ","P1-N4005F1":"to be a lot of crap calls. But the nice thing is as I get busy I can be picky, you know. And, you know, so I remembered there was—when I was going over to Marcia when we were first dating that, you know, I’d get up. I would beat traffic, you know. I would just and recently it’s like ","P1-N4005F2":"I—you know, even getting up at 6:00, I just—I get stuck in traffic. It’s like all this wasted time, you know. Storms and, you know, I was going over there and not really getting work done and that I should have. And, you know, today getting up at five. [00:28:13]
THERAPIST: You mean when—
CLIENT: Here’s the example. So, you know, she’s kind of asking me why—it’s in her text blog, you know. You know, I was frustrated, upset, whatever, you know. And so, she—when I got over there, she asked me about it. And I was like, “Oh, you know, the kids were,”—you ","P1-N400651":"know, and it’s not like I can come out and sit here for 45 minutes and boom, boom, go through all this shit that’s bothering me. Like one or two things comes out and it was the kids. And, you know, she just muttered under her breath. “They’re kids,” you know. Like, you ","P1-N400652":"know, what’s your fucking problem? You know, and the other thing when I talked about work, she’s like, “That’s life,” you know. Not to me but kind of, you know. And at first that really bothered me. And maybe that I’m okay being bother by it. But I understand how ","P1-N400653":"she doesn’t understand, you know.
THERAPIST: I follow. [00:30:40]
CLIENT: But she’s not being completely unreasonable. And then I probably have to, you know, work this out with her in some way. And it came up yesterday like when I cancelled with the kids. You know, she wanted to know whether I was going to still have dinner with the kids or she was going to ","P1-N400691":"make dinner. But and I think there was this thing about, you know, me being not so—maybe this is just self-conscious. But, you know, I don’t have a second thought about trying to make up for not having the kids. I’ll see them Friday, you know. And I think she may have been picking ","P1-N400692":"up on that. And it’s only going to get worse, you know. I mean I’m—I haven’t used Jess’ office in months and I’ve used it like three times in, you know. [00:31:29]
THERAPIST: It does seem like the work is going to be part of it. I mean getting more business, having this—
CLIENT: Having a reason to wake up and take a shower because I got to meet with a client. You know, putting on slacks instead of—and having closings, meeting, you know. I got another closing tonight, you know. Just I don’t know. And this is just the start of it, you know. I know this is ","P1-N400711":"just the start of it.
THERAPIST: I don’t know. It kind of sounds like you found a niche with the landlord\/tenant stuff. So, I imagine it doesn’t seem like it’s just a good few weeks either. But something that’s really on the way up.
CLIENT: Yeah. And this is—this just came, so this, you know—all this great feeling was before this. But, you know, there’s—let’s see. (tongue clicking) So, this is, you know, the mortgage guys in Beverly. The one guy who came to the—
THERAPIST: The tip? [00:34:35]
CLIENT: The (inaudible) tip and, you know. He just doesn’t have it. You know, I had him act as a witness for a state plan yesterday. And he didn’t even bring a business card down, you know. To dress up, you know. And it’s another great thing that happened is, you know, I get these ","P1-N400791":"witnesses. So, I sent out a mass letter to all the—my contacts in Pembroke and around and financial planners just to let them know I’m doing this. And so, I’ve had a witness brigade. So, I’m thinking oh, maybe one or two people will respond. Overwhelmed by how many people are ","P1-N400792":"going to help me out just being a witness. Because they see a chance to meet another professional and a client, you know. [00:35:12]
THERAPIST: What do you mean?
CLIENT: I’ve got money coming in. To put my cabinets in and, you know. I don’t think Bruce’s going to charge me much if anything to do the work. You know, that was really the big expense. You know, the IKEA cabinets are, you know. That’s really going to be my big expense, now. ","P1-N4007F1":"But I think I—you know, all these little things I’ve got to do. I’ve got to look more professional now. People coming in from Salem, you know. And, yeah. I think it’s just, you know, routine. Showers, brushing teeth, you know. All this, you know, come together. You know, just—it’s ","P1-N4007F2":"all the work really, you know.
THERAPIST: I hope you (inaudible 00:37:33) this way.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it—it’s uncanny. It’s every fucking day I’m getting an inquiry. So, if real estate blows up again, I don’t think I would even—I’d probably in business would explode because of, you know—I’d be well entrenched.
THERAPIST: Well, it’s been a long time. That’s really neat.
CLIENT: Yeah. So, and you know the relationship with the guy, the new guy, seems to be going okay. And got some Frisbee players buying properties as usual. And, you know, it’s funny because I was thinking yesterday. You know, it’s like Jim, the guy who doesn’t think to bring a business ","P1-N400871":"card. It’s funny. And I’m like, you know her, because I didn’t her refi for (inaudible 00:38:33) people or certain people it seems like. So, it’s like—so, but I was thinking I was driving from Merrimac. And I was like, “God. You know, how can I really,”—you ","P1-N400872":"know, because Karl wrote me back saying that he would—him and Harry mentioning about Jim. Him and Harry would want to be on my witness brigade I’m calling it. And, you know, I replied back, “Great.” You know they got—bought these crazy bocce ball or whatever. I need to ","P1-N400873":"start practicing for my Memorial Day barbecue. And I’m just like—I’m like what a—just kind of didn’t know how to approach dealing with Karl who’s sending me business, Harry who’s now in the Pembroke BNI (ph), but he’s got the Concord Rotary, which I’ve ","P1-N400874":"got my eye on once you can find me a new time slot. We’ve talked about this before, didn’t we? Yeah. [00:39:34]
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: Maybe we haven’t. What’s that?
THERAPIST: What do you want?
CLIENT: Well, Concord Rotary —and I’m not ready for Concord Rotary. But Concord Rotary meets at noon on Tuesdays. So, you know, me getting out of here at 10:00, I’d have to go straight up. You know, just a big chunk that I’m giving up on Thursdays that I can’t Tuesdays ","P1-N4008F1":"as well with a payoff that is much farther down the road. It’s a service group. And but it’s an opportunity to meet other attorneys. And so, I would want to move my meeting with you to a different day or time. I think you even mentioned maybe like 7:00 a.m. on Monday or something stupid ","P1-N4008F2":"like that. Or—
THERAPIST: Right. I had had an early appointment on Monday. But I can keep booking up. [00:40:33]
CLIENT: I mean it’s no big deal right now because I just—
THERAPIST: Right. You’re not quite there yet.
CLIENT: You know, it’s funny because I was about to jump on it. I looked at this and I said no. Now I’m glad because I’ve got a lot of other balls in the air now, you know. And, you know, hopefully Jess will give me some money for taxes. But, you know, in estate planning the money ","P1-N400971":"comes up front. The landlord\/tenant. Hopefully, like this woman I meet on Tuesday I can get some money from her, you know, up front. And then there’ll be the day that unless they are that Section 8 client that I can just demand. So, we’ll see how long it lasts. Yeah. I mean I think the business, ","P1-N400972":"the—will keep coming in. When will this start killing me? That’s the, you know. [00:41:37]
THERAPIST: Well, so far it’s making you feel better. I mean it’s like a—it’s a virtuous cycle.
CLIENT: It’s like I know—it’s like right now there—it’s like there’s a bunch of checks waiting to be sent to me, you know. So, it’s like I’m not even stressed out about the money. That I have no money, you know. I don’t know if I should feel about ","P1-N4009B1":"this, but one of the things that bothered me about Valentine’s Day was the amount of money I spent. The effort I put into it. I don’t know. We make some reservations. We buy some flowers. I got a little (inaudible 00:42:11) ring, which she’s wearing on this finger. I asked her to go ","P1-N4009B2":"steady. She’s like we already were going steady.
THERAPIST: Congratulations.
CLIENT: I said, “Well, now it’s official.” So, you know, I think that’s kind of part of—was part of it too. It’s like I really spent a lot of money that I didn’t have, you know. Everything was expensive, you know.
THERAPIST: We’ve got—
CLIENT: But even after the blow up she was very—thanks for everything. (inaudible).
