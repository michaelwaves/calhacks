TITLE: Client "B", Session August 15, 2013: Client discusses the issues in her marriage and how her husband is being distant and irritable. Client discusses issues at her job.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the issues in her marriage and how her husband is being distant and irritable. Client discusses issues at her job.
CLIENT: I'm going up to town tomorrow because I'm staying at Ashley's (ph) place tonight. I had to pack...
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: ...for the weekend and I didn't (inaudible at 00:00:31) ridiculous reasons. The laundry machine in our building is broken. And our landlord promised he would have it fixed by the weekend and he didn't get it fixed. He said he would have the repair guy on Monday. So I said, "Okay. I'll do laundry ","P1-N4000F1":"Monday night." No, it didn't happened. So (inaudible) Tuesday. So I said, "I'll do laundry Tuesday night." It didn't happen Tuesday. So last night, I kind of had to just suck it up and go to a laundromat and by the time I got home, I just did not feel like packing. [00:00:57]
THERAPIST: Whatever comes to mind.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: Yeah. So... (PAUSE) I don't know. (PAUSE) [00:03:00]
THERAPIST: Is your mind like blank or you just don't want to talk about it or...
CLIENT: I don't know. Hard to talk about? (inaudible at 00:04:11) (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: Because it's difficult stuff?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: So... (PAUSE) I don't know. Things are weird with Dave (ph) and I don't know how to describe how they've gone weird. But they've been weird for like a year now.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: And I don't know what to do. I mean, to some extent, like he's never been much for talking about his feelings and so that's not weird. But I feel like... I don't know. I've been worried more frequently that he's unhappy and not saying so. [00:05:01]
THERAPIST: Oh really?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: Doing different things but, you know... And they are things that make him happy. But he still... We're both out of the house, you know, three or four nights a week. So I don't know. (PAUSE) That worries me. (PAUSE) [00:09:00]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...and then his parents came to visit. And he's way more introverted than I am. He needs a gazillion times more alone time than I do. And he doesn't get any when his family's around because they're all extroverts except Dave. It's a little weird. (PAUSE) [00:13:00]
THERAPIST: I imagine something that would make this difficult to talk about is that you worry (PAUSE) (inaudible at 00:15:59) being critical of you for being upset or for something about your job or something. [00:16:11]
CLIENT: Maybe. (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: (inaudible) you're not supposed to be talking about this because this is really just about how you feel and it doesn't matter to you as opposed to like (inaudible at 00:16:49)
CLIENT: No. I think it's more... (PAUSE) [00:17:00]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Is there a kind of...
CLIENT: And implied "you suck" tacked on at the end.
THERAPIST: Oh okay. (PAUSE) I was going to say kind of a veiled criticism of (inaudible at 00:17:27)
CLIENT: Yep. (PAUSE) [00:18:00]
THERAPIST: And so I guess... [00:19:07]
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: And kind of (inaudible at 00:22:15) (PAUSE) (inaudible) (PAUSE) [00:23:00]
CLIENT: (SIGH) (PAUSE) So there's very long backstory that I don't want to get into. But the... The bottom line is I got the story in my flesh (ph) like for the magazine that I read for that was very passive aggressive attack on one of my friends. It was really, really obvious. There's just like years ","P1-N400771":"of drama between this person and his friends and my friends and it's just... Yeah.
THERAPIST: So you know who the author is?
CLIENT: Oh yes.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Yes I do. He and his cronies have been like actively harassing some of my friends for years now. And there was a recent spike in hostilities. And it's stupid. But anyway, the story really upset me a lot. And so I replied to the chief editor saying, telling him this is what this is about. And ","P1-N4007F1":"also, I can't send this guy a rejection letter because I have said too many unkind things about him in public. It will just cause drama for the whole magazine. Give this to some other reader because...
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:24:59]
CLIENT: ...they should... Yeah. But anyway, I was really upset...
THERAPIST: ...your inbox or whatever.
CLIENT: Yeah. Luck of the draw, I guess. But anyway, I was... I was really upset about it.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I went on Twitter and ranted a little bit, very obliquely because, you know, it would be very unprofessional to discuss a submission in detail. So like I didn't name names. I didn't even say what I was upset about. I just said, you know, "Someone pulled a really passive aggressive move over ","P1-N4008D1":"me and my friends and I'm really upset."
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Like, "Why are people so horrible?"
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And so Jodie (ph) then IMed me and said, "You know, now I'm really irrationally worried that I'm the shitty person you're talking about. Can you like reassure me that you're not mad at me and, you know, if I've done something wrong, can you please tell me directly?" And it was just... (PAUSE) ","P1-N400951":"I certainly understand the fear when someone is talking very obliquely about something that upset them. [00:26:03]
THERAPIST: Right. [00:27:01]
CLIENT: But like at the same time I still care about her and want to maintain her as a friendship and like... I don't think she's done anything to make, to make our friendship impossible. So... (PAUSE) I don't know. (PAUSE) And partly, I kind of feel like, well, the answer here is easy. If you're worried ","P1-N4009B1":"if you relationship with Tom (ph) and behavior around him is upsetting to me then, you know... You could make a twist there that would resolve this problem like conclusively. But she's clearly not willing or able to do that and so... (SIGH) I don't know. It's just... (PAUSE) And I can't talk to Dave ","P1-N4009B2":"about this because his response is, "Well, you shouldn't have slept with Tom in the first place. I warned you he was bad news," which isn't exactly helpful to hear. [00:28:01]
THERAPIST: Okay. But I think (PAUSE) you also (PAUSE) seem to be sort of describing or anticipating like kind of boomerang effect. What a technical term.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Sort of a boomerang effect of your anger. Like... (PAUSE) I'm not sort of... Like just being the reality of what you say, just like it all comes together. [00:31:59]
CLIENT: That's actually accurate. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Well, that's what I'm saying. I'm not doubting that. I'm not saying you're making that up. I'm just saying that... And then, with Jodie, you can't be angry, you can't sort of express your anger at her because that will make things worse between you. Again, that could be true.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I'm not counseling you otherwise. And with Dave as well, like you don't get to be angry about stuff with Jodie because he was right.
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: And so if you're angry, it's going to just make you feel bad that you didn't listen to Dave in the first place...
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: ...which is what he's going to say. (PAUSE) [00:33:00]
CLIENT: I mean, I am angry at Kate (ph), not at you.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I see. (PAUSE) My point really again is not that, you know, you're sort of distorting things you expect but that I imagine you feel sort of probably constrained. [00:34:15]
CLIENT: Yep. (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: And like you really kind of have to sort of hold back or hold in.
CLIENT: There's this... My group consumes a product of another group. They're called macros (ph). The macro team designs them and we consume them. And we were reviewing the macros last week and I told my macro owners, there were two of them, you know, "These are the things I need from you. I cannot ","P1-N400C91":"do my job unless you do X, Y, and Z." And so the things I asked them to do were legitimately difficult things to do from a technical perspective. That's why I need them from them because the problems that... Because I'm having problems with that. [00:35:05]
THERAPIST: We need to stop.
CLIENT: Yeah. Sorry.
THERAPIST: That's okay.
CLIENT: I interrupted the thought you were, the point you were making for another example of fame. But tomorrow?
THERAPIST: Yeah. Oh wait. (PAUSE) Are we on for tomorrow? That works for me.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I think in the future, I'm going to want to drop back down to two a week because I just, I can't afford the three.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: But I had been planning on coming tomorrow.
THERAPIST: Alright. Good. So I'll see you then. Okay.
CLIENT: And then, I guess tomorrow we can talk about which two days I'll see you. (PAUSE)
