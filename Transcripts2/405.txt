TITLE: Client "J", Session May 17, 2013: Client discusses problems with medication, and ongoing financial issues.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses problems with medication, and ongoing financial issues.
THERAPIST: I still have not charged your card.
CLIENT: I noticed.
THERAPIST: I will get on that this weekend, because I’m actually doing bills (inaudible at 00:00:05) this weekend. I’m late this month from being away at the beginning of the month. And I don’t check where you’re at, as well, in the process of doing bills.
CLIENT: Don’t spend it all in one place.
THERAPIST: I’ll try not to. Oops.
CLIENT: Do you have experience with Prozac and withdrawal?
THERAPIST: No, not really. [00:01:00] I mean, I know a little bit about SSRI withdrawal in general but not Prozac (inaudible at 00:01:04) to it.
CLIENT: Anything not working if I haven’t taken it in the past two days?
THERAPIST: How much are you on?
CLIENT: Forty milligrams.
THERAPIST: Let’s see. There are a few that you’re supposed to be really careful about withdrawal. I don’t think it’s on here. I think there was—maybe there’s a little bit of increased suicidality in withdrawal from something. Maybe it’s Paxil; maybe it’s ","P1-N400231":"more in adolescents than in adults. But . . .
CLIENT: I read online that it was 20% of people have withdrawal from Prozac that have been on it more than six weeks. [00:02:09]
THERAPIST: Which involves . . . ?
CLIENT: All kinds of—from hallucinations to—I was nauseous last night, that’s why I was wondering.
THERAPIST: That could be—20% of people are not having hallucinations from (crosstalk at 00:02:24).
CLIENT: No, no, within that 20%, some people are having (crosstalk at 00:02:28).
THERAPIST: Yeah, I think (crosstalk at 00:02:28).
CLIENT: That’s the one end of the spectrum, yeah.
THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:02:29) heard of that, yeah.
CLIENT: And then suicidality, if that’s the word you want to use. But basically what happened is, once again, I failed to rise to the occasion. So, I called up Micah, because I knew it was the meds. And . . . so, she put me down to 30 milligrams of Prozac. And I’m just like, I fucking hate ","P1-N400351":"these meds. [00:03:02] That my jaw is constantly clenched because of the Adderall. It gives me tingling in my ears and just, I don’t know. So I decided to stop taking the Prozac [chuckles] for a little while. We’ll see how crazy I get. I’m seeing her on Tuesday.
THERAPIST: Okay, good. Yeah, because obviously she would be the expert (inaudible at 00:03:29).
CLIENT: Oh, I’m not going to tell her I wasn’t taking what she told me to.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:03:34) tell you went off the Prozac. [chuckles]
CLIENT: Well, I’ll probably start taking it again on Saturday. Tomorrow.
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: Well, because I assume I need some of it, right? [00:04:01]
THERAPIST: Well, then, why did you stop taking it?
CLIENT: I just . . . [chuckles]
THERAPIST: [chuckles]
CLIENT: Get it out of my system? I don’t know. To see if it made a difference? I don’t know. I look at the bottle, I can’t open it.
THERAPIST: Wait, what?
CLIENT: I look at the bottle, it says Fluoxetine on it. I can’t open it.
THERAPIST: You mean you have, like, a block, I guess. Is that what you’re saying?
CLIENT: It’s kind of like (inaudible at 00:04:33). [chuckles]
THERAPIST: Well . . . so this, I think, is largely about the sexual trouble it’s causing you and how you feel about that.
CLIENT: Whew. Thank God for you. [chuckles] [00:05:00]
THERAPIST: [laughs]
CLIENT: I thought it was something else. Whew.
THERAPIST: [laughs]
CLIENT: And once again, I wasn’t stressed out or anxious or . . . Marcia blamed herself. I’m thinking, “Yeah, you probably could do a better job.” [chuckles] So it’s the meds.
THERAPIST: Have there been times when things have worked out better?
CLIENT: [chuckles]
THERAPIST: On the meds?
CLIENT: Within the last couple years, there was no opportunity to determine (crosstalk at 00:05:53). No.
THERAPIST: I didn’t know how many times you and Marcia . . .
CLIENT: No. We haven’t had sex due to technical difficulties. [00:06:02] So, I don’t know.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, okay.
CLIENT: Okay? What’s okay?
THERAPIST: Well, I was just thinking about whether I had any other questions (inaudible at 00:06:50).
THERAPIST: What makes you sure it’s the meds?
CLIENT: [sighs] I don’t know. The high dosage that I’m on. And supposedly, being on Wellbutrin, that’s supposed to counteract that effect. But I think I’m just on such a high dosage that . . .
THERAPIST: Are you on Wellbutrin anymore?
CLIENT: Yeah, I’m taking 200 SR—
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: In the morning. But my guess is that Wellbutrin doesn’t work for everybody and I’m one of those people. So . . .
THERAPIST: Has this been an issue in your past?
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:07:52)
THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: I mean, maybe . . . I don’t know.
THERAPIST: But not really.
CLIENT: No. [00:08:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, that certainly sounds very possible that it’s (inaudible at 00:08:04). Sucks.
CLIENT: No, it doesn’t. [chuckles] Never mind. [laughs]
THERAPIST: Heh.
CLIENT: Yeah, so, I was nauseous playing Frisbee last night. And I was frustrated because, yeah, I’ve been exercising a lot.
THERAPIST: Right, (inaudible at 00:08:38). Cameron, you should talk to Micah about this.
CLIENT: We’re going to talk about it.
THERAPIST: Okay. And you should tell her the truth about what you’re taking.
CLIENT: [I know] (ph).
THERAPIST: She won’t kick you out. Her job is to help you.
CLIENT: I know she won’t kick me out but she’ll do something I don’t agree with.
THERAPIST: There’s only one person who’s going to pick up the pills and put them in your mouth. [00:09:00] It’s really only up to you. She’s got to work with you on that.
CLIENT: Are you lecturing me?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Pretend I’m flipping you off.
THERAPIST: You flip me off, I’m going to say one more thing, which is you’re doing the same thing as you—
CLIENT: Do you know that is?
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: It’s for those who don’t deserve the best.
THERAPIST: [laughs] That’s pretty funny. You’re doing it (crosstalk at 00:09:35).
CLIENT: Doesn’t work in traffic, though. [laughs]
THERAPIST: [laughs] (inaudible at 00:09:40) it. You’re doing the same thing that you often do, where she becomes the heavy and the responsible person, and you’re—
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:09:53)
THERAPIST: But it’s true, isn’t it?
CLIENT: No, it’s not. I’m taking responsibility. [00:10:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah, but you’re being—you’re not being up-front with her.
CLIENT: Why do I have to be up-front with her? Is there some rule? Just because—
THERAPIST: No, no. Actually, precisely not because of the rule. It’s because if you go to your car mechanic and you don’t actually really tell them what’s going on and what’s wrong, they’re not going to know what to fix or what to suggest that you do.
CLIENT: I mean, I’m consistent with where she’s going. I’m just doing it a little quicker than—I’m not stopping the [take it] (ph). I mean . . .
THERAPIST: Maybe she would actually be—
CLIENT: I’ll tell her I missed couple doses.
THERAPIST: able to help you. You could say, “It’s really”—”The sexual side effects are really bothering me. I don’t want to wait a month to taper down off this. Is there some way to do this quicker? Can I just stop taking it? Or can I drop down very quickly? Or ","P1-N400CF1":"can I do something else that’s going to help me with the sexual side effects because I don’t want to wait a month? It’s a new relationship and it’s a problem.” [00:11:14]
CLIENT: And you know what she’s going to say? Suck it up.
THERAPIST: Really? You don’t know that. Maybe she’ll say, “I’ll write you Viagra if (inaudible at 00:11:29).” That’ll get you through. Maybe she’ll say, “You know what? If you’re willing to deal with—it’s up to you. Maybe you’ll ","P1-N400D31":"have some more headaches and some more nausea, but if that matters less to you than (inaudible at 00:11:40), stop tomorrow.”
CLIENT: And if she’s not?
THERAPIST: Well, it’s ultimately your decision anyway, right? This way, it’s just a little more informed.
CLIENT: I’ve been to drugs.com. I read it.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: [chuckles]
THERAPIST: Is that usually predictive of what she’s going to say?
CLIENT: Actually, there . . . every website, from Johns Hopkins to [all these] (ph) pretty much had the same information. It’s almost like they cut and pasted from the same source, and . . .
THERAPIST: You mean about stopping Prozac?
CLIENT: The different options to counteract sexual dysfunction with SSRIs. [00:13:01]
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: There are six options. And the first one is to reduce the amount the SSRI that you’re taking.
THERAPIST: Why don’t you just tell her that?
CLIENT: Tell her what? I don’t want to. I’m not going to do things I don’t want just to make you happy, because you think I’m not taking responsibility and I’m passing it onto her.
THERAPIST: No, I think you’re actually depriving yourself of the chance to get the best help you can.
CLIENT: But she’s the problem, don’t you see that?
THERAPIST: [laughs] No.
CLIENT: Really?
THERAPIST: Yeah. I don’t see how she is going to prevent you from doing something you want.
CLIENT: You are biased. You have blinders on, because she is a colleague. [00:14:00] She’s in the same line of work.
THERAPIST: So, explain to me how she’s getting—how she can get in the way of getting what you want. As opposed to you getting in the way of what you want.
CLIENT: Well, because, what if she doesn’t want to wean me as quick as I want to? What if she doesn’t want me to stop cold turkey?
THERAPIST: Do it anyway.
CLIENT: That’s what I’m doing.
THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:14:23)
CLIENT: But I don’t want to cut cold turkey. I just want to go down quicker.
THERAPIST: So ask her about that. You get to do what you want anyway. She can say whatever she wants, you can do—
CLIENT: I don’t want her to think I’m a bad person who’s not going to listen to her.
THERAPIST: Cameron, if she can’t understand that you want to drop down quickly because not being able to have sex with your new girlfriend is really a problem, then you want to see her anyway.
CLIENT: Is Marcia really my girlfriend? [00:15:01]
THERAPIST: You know what I mean.
CLIENT: [I don’t, actually] (ph).
THERAPIST: Of course [you know what I mean] (ph). What if you actually don’t have anything to hide or be ashamed of here, really, with Micah?
CLIENT: What’s that?
THERAPIST: What if you actually don’t really have anything to hide or be ashamed of here [chuckles] with Micah?
CLIENT: It’s a very uncomfortable conversation. And you just keep dragging it out.
THERAPIST: Yeah, because I think it relates to sex. That’s psychologically important to you.
CLIENT: I don’t really see anyone out there who’s male, who would have this issue and would call up their female pscychopharmacologist and be like—which, first of all, isn’t in the iPhone dictionary. But, “Hey! Guess what, Micah!” [laughs] [00:16:00]
THERAPIST: Maybe you’re wrong. People (ph) does that all the time.
CLIENT: “Something funny happened to me the other night. Let’s giggle about it.” [chuckles]
THERAPIST: No, not at all.
CLIENT: [chuckles]
THERAPIST: “Sexual side effects causing a problem in a new relationship, I really don’t like it. [chuckles] How can I stop that as soon as possible?” It doesn’t have to be very giggly. I get that you’re uncomfortable and I appreciate you’re making it clear that that’s ","P1-N401291":"a lot of this.
CLIENT: You should be like, “You know, Cameron, I’m very proud that you were able to call her and attack this problem head on.” [chuckles] I was pretty surprised I was able to call her, I wasn’t going to call her. [00:17:00]
THERAPIST: I think that it’s good.
CLIENT: Marcia went a little crazy, yelling (ph). I don’t know. She’s upset, herself, about the whole ex-boyfriend living with him thing. And I guess she made it seem like they made some sort of agreement, that they wouldn’t bring other people over, which means—I don’t ","P1-N401311":"know. I guess that makes sense, maybe [it does] (ph) (crosstalk at 00:17:48).
THERAPIST: How long ago did they break up?
CLIENT: I don’t pry into previous relationships. I find it uncomfortable (crosstalk at 00:17:54).
THERAPIST: A month or a year?
CLIENT: No, (crosstalk at 00:17:56). They were living together, so, [I don’t know]. She was telling me Lennon’s moving out soon. I don’t remember exactly what she said. But now, she lost her job. She needs a roommate. And she’s put in this situation of, “Do I let him stay ","P1-N401391":"just because I need the money?”
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:19:11) so, I don’t know.
CLIENT: She could be having her little monthly friend, whatever. She had a couple drinks. We were asked to leave the bar. That was long after she was crying, though.
THERAPIST: Because it was closing or if you guys were . . . ?
CLIENT: We were being a bit obnoxious. We’re kind of a toxic duo. [chuckles] I warned her. I said, “Don’t ask me to do anything you’re not prepared to see me do.”
THERAPIST: Why’d you get kicked out of the bar?
CLIENT: Oh, there were a lot of reasons. [laughs] [00:20:00] [sighs] We broke some glasses. We harassed the staff. We harassed the manager. Randomly yelling out [laughs] words; she kept yelling out “dildo.” Stuff like that, stuff like that. And there were three people left in the bar. And ","P1-N401491":"I guess were making out and they asked us to leave, heh. So . . .
THERAPIST: Yeah, (crosstalk at 00:20:52).
CLIENT: He really didn’t have to do anything. There’s three other people in the bar. But I think we just pushed him over the edge, heh. [00:21:02] It was funny.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:21:10)
CLIENT: Going camping tomorrow with Maureen (inaudible at 00:21:23).
THERAPIST: Oh, that (inaudible at 00:21:25), right? (inaudible at 00:21:27)
CLIENT: Help (ph)? I want to make all these funny tics with my face (inaudible at 00:21:42). Right here, the muscles are getting bigger (inaudible at 00:21:52). [00:22:00]
CLIENT: So, I let the 30 days lapse where I was supposed to send updated information to Chase on a loan application. I’m going to send it today. I’ve got absolutely no work, really. I mean, I’ve got some, but nothing really that’s going to make me any money. So . . . And I know ","P1-N4015D1":"everyone’s slow, because I’m not getting any title (ph) examination requests.
CLIENT: So, one, two, three whole days without Jess pissing me off. Pretty good, huh? Haven’t really communicated or much with her (inaudible at 00:24:01), so . . .
THERAPIST: Oh, (inaudible at 00:24:08). So, after today, I’ll see you on Friday next week?
CLIENT: Yeah.
CLIENT: I’m seeing Micah on that (inaudible at 00:24:44) Thursday.
THERAPIST: Do want to come in Wednesday at 8:30?
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: 8:30?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: It’s my crazy condo case. It’s been 45, so I sent the trustees an e-mail. And the same kind of bullshit from the Crazy Lady.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:26:19) because they haven’t paid you yet?
CLIENT: Yeah. It’s almost $6,000. And one of the trustees is claiming that she set aside money to pay me, which—Crazy writes the checks. And she still doesn’t understand. And I’m pissed off, because her attorney is supporting her instead of educating her. But she doesn’t ","P1-N401871":"understand that I represented the trust. And it’s the trust that owes me the money. How they want to figure out who owes among the trust is not my problem.
THERAPIST: Can you just write her an e-mail? Say, “I’m no longer going to read your e-mails”?
CLIENT: No, hm-mmm, hm-mmm. The other trustees told her that all the time and she kept firing off e-mails.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: And it’s really not so much—I don’t care. I’m saving all the e-mails. I’m taking these all to court. The inconsistencies and the stuff she says . . . (inaudible at 00:28:55) want to make it a little frustrating for her.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: A single e-mail saying, “Don’t contact me.” [00:29:03]
THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:29:02)
CLIENT: Yeah, I don’t want to set up a block where I can’t get (inaudible at 00:29:10).
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:29:11)
CLIENT: [chuckles] So, the question is how long I wait before—I’m not going to sit around like I would for most people, expecting some money to come. I know she’s fucking crazy and she’s not going to cut me a check.
THERAPIST: What does that mean?
CLIENT: That means she’s got a cloud on her title.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: Until she pays off the judgment.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: So, she can’t refinance or sell without paying off the entire judgment. None of them would be able to.
THERAPIST: And judgment (crosstalk at 00:31:25).
CLIENT: Even if I get Elaine’s portion, there’s no way for me to not have it apply.
THERAPIST: Right. So, that (ph) the judgment is (ph) small claims
CLIENT: Right. Usually, in a trust situation, the beneficiaries are not liable for the trust. But in this situation, the beneficiaries are the trust. All three are trustees. All three are the only beneficiaries. They’re so closely related that they are the trust, so, they’re ultimately that’s ","P1-N401BF1":"the case I’m going to make, that they’re liable. I’m sure there’s some case law up there, too, for condos, to get them individually liable for the money.
THERAPIST: Wait, what do you mean the judgment for—the judgment against them in small claims court for $20,000?
CLIENT: When I got summary judgment.
THERAPIST: Oh, you mean that way the case—
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: it sounds like, okay.
CLIENT: You got to suffer damages for there to be malpractice.
THERAPIST: I see. You mean you won.
CLIENT: Yes. [00:33:00] [laughs]
THERAPIST: [laughs] Yeah, I remember that.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Well, it’s hard for them to sue for malpractice if you’ve won.
CLIENT: Right, right. And even if I—you still have to suffer some damage. You’ve got to be missing something, something you didn’t have before.
THERAPIST: Right, your problem has to—your malpractice has its cost of trouble (ph).
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I mean, sometimes you lose, sometimes you lose and (inaudible at 00:33:21) that cost them damage. I see.
CLIENT: And also, when the counter-claim comes, the question is do I want to go [to find] (ph) my insurance company and have them do the lawsuit? I don’t know. So . . . Which is another reason just to keep it in small claims and take what I can get. Even a judgment against the condo association ","P1-N401E11":"is going to cloud their title. So . . . [0 0:34:00]
CLIENT: I told Jerry he could send me Elaine’s portion. Within two weeks, it was gone. And I’ll be liable for her interest from the date of all the invoices, so . . .
CLIENT: Yeah, but I would enjoy the magistrate yelling at Crazy to shut up, because she’s not talking about anything relevant to the case. This is what I deal with when I deal with these tenants and the pro bono, lawyer-of-the-day stuff. [00:35:03] I really just start spitting out all this information ","P1-N401E91":"on a single case. Let’s focus on (inaudible at 00:35:07).
THERAPIST: [I see] (ph).
CLIENT: The conversation you and your landlord had, where you disagreed on whether Obama was a Muslim or not a Muslim really doesn’t play into the fact that you owe $3,000 in rent and you were evicted or you were terminated, so . . .
THERAPIST: I think . . .
THERAPIST: I think you often feel in Crazy Lady’s shoes, like when you’re disagreeing with Jess or another—like at the bar or other situations. I think you often set yourself up.
CLIENT: I set myself up?
THERAPIST: Yeah, to be kind of in her position.
CLIENT: I thought it was fun being kicked out of the bar.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I could get that, too. [00:38:00]
CLIENT: The thing is, she’s not living in the world we live in. With Jess, I’m living in the world we live in.
THERAPIST: Yes, absolutely. I don’t mean it like that. I didn’t mean so much the crazy part as the part where you’re in a situation with somebody else, feeling like you really don’t have a leg to stand on, feeling like you can bluster or whatever, but you’re ultimately wrong.
CLIENT: Even when you’re not. See, she doesn’t feel that. She feels superior. She feels like she can’t lose. She feels like the world is wrong. That her way is the only way and that—
THERAPIST: I see. (inaudible at 00:38:41) But that’s not really how you see her.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:38:49) She’s the exact opposite of what she thinks. She has PTSD, she was abused.
THERAPIST: Oh, really?
CLIENT: Yeah, so . . . [0:39:00] So, it’ll be interesting what the bar council does if she file a complaint. Because I had another bar where they filed a complaint against me that I had his escrow money. And the bar counsel, the assistant bar counsel, didn’t understand how real estate demands ","P1-N402131":"work. That they never give me the escrow money.
THERAPIST: [laughs]
CLIENT: They net it out of my wire. I never have the escrow money. So, I sent a letter explaining this, and she still didn’t understand. I had to sit on the phone and walk her thought the closing instructions I sent to her, showing the gross amount of the wire and then all the things that were ","P1-N402171":"deducted, including the escrows. The lender fees, interest.
THERAPIST: I see. I see.
CLIENT: Yeah, (inaudible at 00:39:54). And I don’t even think she’s going to get to that, because she has to allege something I’d done wrong. And she’s allegedly doing my job. I mean, my job wasn’t to make sure the condo was running in smooth, working order. I was collecting ","P1-N4021D1":"money from her. That was my job. So . . .
CLIENT: [sighs] [00:41:00]
THERAPIST: [We’re almost out of time] (ph). That’s a Wednesday.
CLIENT: See you Wednesday, (inaudible at 00:41:53).
