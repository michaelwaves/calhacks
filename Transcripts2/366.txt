DESCRIPTION: Client is upset about the current trajectory of his separation as it is hindering his dating chances. Client is stressed about money and paying his bills.
CLIENT: Can I at least admonish you for not putting the correct codes with the Blue Cross?
THERAPIST: What happened?
CLIENT: I got a letter...
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:00:19)
CLIENT: ...from them saying that my...
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: ...therapist is a... (SIGH) I was expecting there to be a check at the bottom but it said it was from early February.
THERAPIST: Huh.
CLIENT: Beginning of February.
THERAPIST: Alright.
CLIENT: So you probably just accidentally used the old codes.
THERAPIST: That's strange. Okay.
CLIENT: They say they're going to notify you. So...
THERAPIST: Yeah. They probably did. I probably just haven't...
CLIENT: So what were you going to do?
THERAPIST: Um...
CLIENT: Do we have to schedule (inaudible at 00:00:49)?
CLIENT: That's great because I'm a fucking wreck.
THERAPIST: Well let's talk about that.
CLIENT: I don't even know where to begin.
THERAPIST: Let me know if it gets sunny over there.
CLIENT: Yeah. Might as well just let them down now. So you know how I've been struggling with this whole separation thing, right? You know, how my online profile...
THERAPIST: Yeah, that I know.
CLIENT: Well on Tuesday Olivia has a couple of messages about, you know, being divorced or whatever and I kind of just ignore them. And I had given her my cell phone number so I, you know, know that she's googling me and... You know? [00:01:55]
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: And that's when he zaps them. You know? So I just saw... That's the only thing that showed up in the e-mail and I was just like, "Oh fuck." And of course it's like, you know, "Are you divorced, separated, or never been married?" And she put in there she's done the separated thing, she's been ","P1-N400411":"burned, and it's an emotional risk she's not willing to take. So I write a five thousand word, five thousand character message, you know, spilling the truth and... You know? Whatever. [00:02:55]
THERAPIST: Five thousand?
CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) What she focused on was the omission of not putting it in my profile.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: She specifically which I don't know how you could do it but apparently in her searches she excludes...
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: ...people that have married or separated in their profile. So, you know, a couple messages, you know, back and forth or whatever. She gives me her e-mail address and, you know, says, you know, "When you're divorced, send me an e-mail." But it turns out to be her special online stalker e-mail. ","P1-N4004F1":"You know? She's very, you know, much like the woman with no name, you know, very close, holds her cards very close. You know? [00:03:55]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: They keep using the word "messy." You know? And so I start getting upset. I'm like, you know, "Here's just another way Jess's (ph) fucking me." You know? And the more I think about it I'm just like, you know, "You shouldn't be blaming Jess. You should be blaming yourself." You know, you're coming ","P1-N400551":"up with every excuse in the world not to push forward with the divorce. You know?
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: And, you know, "What the fuck are you doing?" And so I texted Jess, "I want to move forward with the divorce." (LAUGHTER) [00:04:59]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: You know? Saying, you know, "This is the first nice guy you've met online and now you're just being too rigid." You know? And then she has a friend who dated a guy who was separated and got married and she admonished her as well. [00:07:57]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Because I'm obviously not going on to message her.
THERAPIST: Because you're not sending her... Yeah.
CLIENT: But I was like, you know, "Hey." You know? That seems like an upgrade to me. You know? And then yesterday I picked up Ian from school and, you know, I forgot (inaudible at 00:09:01). [00:09:01]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know? And he was asking questions about mailing... You know, we went to the post office. Mailing flammable stuff. You know, just... And, you know, we were talking about, you know, lost reserves at banks for, you know, fraud. And so everything... You know, it didn't seem to be bothering me ","P1-N400731":"and it just all of the sudden when I was bringing him home. We literally were right in front of the market basket and he asked me a question... Well right before that the song comes on and the line is "He takes off her dress now."
THERAPIST: Oh The Killers.
CLIENT: Yeah. So one of my favorite songs Mr. Brightside. So he says to me, "Did he say "she takes off her dress" or "he takes off her dress?"
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) [00:10:05]
CLIENT: And then I was like, "Well, I'm not going to lie to the kid..."
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: "...because he's going to hear the song again probably." I'm like, "He said, 'he takes off her dress.'" And he's kind of... I can tell his...
THERAPIST: His wheels are turning?
CLIENT: Yeah. So, you know, he kind of asked me what that meant and I was like, you know... I really don't understand what the song means but to me the song's about jealousy, you know, and that he's concocted in his mind that either this woman he likes or this woman he's dating is seeing another man ","P1-N400831":"and he's jealous about it but ultimately he's looking on the bright side of it or whatever or sarcastically. You know?
THERAPIST: Right. [00:10:59]
CLIENT: And so, "What's jealousy?" And so we're, you know, we're still doing fine and then just we get in front of the market basket and he asked me a question and I just snapped. I snapped at him. I caught myself and, you know, brought my tone back down and continued to answer the question and actually ","P1-N400871":"started just trying to keep talking to him in a calm voice and we get home and Jess had just pulled in with Lucille and it's starting to rain out and I'm standing there and it's raining and he's like taking forever to get out of the car. "Just get out of the fucking car." You know? I didn't say it but, ","P1-N400872":""Come on. Let's go! Let's go!" And, you know, then Jess and Lucille are moving slowly and it's just like, "I just want to get out of the fucking rain." You know? And we go inside and the woman who is going to be renting... Oh, I didn't tell you. Jess is moving.
THERAPIST: Oh. [00:11:55]
CLIENT: Which was a good thing and that's kind of how this whole separation thing came apart (inaudible at 00:12:07) Olivia that the kids are moving closer to me and that I didn't want to say specifically but it's taking care of something that, you know, is a major issue that's going to help me move ","P1-N4008B1":"forward, which means Jess's finally agreed to sell the house. Which I, you know, I said, "All along I knew you weren't going to be able to cut it." You know?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But they're moving literally right outside of...
THERAPIST: Oh really?
CLIENT: ...on the Plymouth (ph) line. So...
THERAPIST: Oh, that's great.
CLIENT: Yeah. You know, real close.
THERAPIST: Easier to see your kids.
CLIENT: I could walk over there.
THERAPIST: Yeah (inaudible at 00:12:35)
CLIENT: More importantly they can walk to me. You know? I mean... So that's kind of how the things got started with Olivia, you know, that conversation. So... Well the woman who...
THERAPIST: And they'll be on the Plymouth side so Ian can keep going to the same school.
CLIENT: Right. That... Jess was talking about moving him to (inaudible) which is, you know, right across the street practically. And, you know, she's like, "But I want to talk to Ian." [00:13:05]
THERAPIST: Renting the house to Jess not...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Yeah. They moved up to Portland. Their daughter was Ian's like best friend at Agacy. You know? [00:13:53]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know?
THERAPIST: Kind of like that.
CLIENT: And (inaudible at 00:15:47) but threw in there that when she's dating someone she, you know, makes time for them obviously. So I was like, "Alright. Whatever." And then I started remembering how she answered one of the questions where, you know, she wanted to... You know, "How quickly would ","P1-N400B91":"you meet with someone?" She had put three weeks. [00:16:05]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: You know, at first I was like, "Oh..." You know, because Olivia had started talking to me again so I was like, "Do I really want to go see this woman?" Then I'm like, you know, "Why the fuck not?" You know? It's not like she's really done something horrible to me. You know, I... Who knows what ","P1-N400C31":"this woman is or who she could be. You know? I mean, why cut off my nose to spite my face. [00:18:57]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And she calls me back and she's like, "Well, you should pay sixty five percent. She should pay whatever the difference, thirty seven... You know? And I'll send you different vouchers. Send them in separately." You know, I guess if you get divorced before October, you can't file married.
THERAPIST: I see. [00:20:59]
CLIENT: So then she's like, wants me to get a letter from the CPA because she wants to apply for food stamps and wants a letter from the CPA explaining, you know, how, the percentage thing. And I texted her or e-mailed her back. I'm like, you know, "It's on your fucking schedule C. Show them your tax ","P1-N400CF1":"forms. That's how much... That's what they're going to want to see. That shows..." You know? It's just one more financial thing she doesn't understand. So I'm just like, you know, "Maybe this was the reason I didn't want to go through the divorce is all these little fucking, you know, little things ","P1-N400CF2":"that just are going to add up, you know, just to drive me crazy." And so that's fucking... You know? Just has me all... At least I... an accountant is joining our group that does family law. I said, "I need to hire you." (LAUGHTER) [00:21:59]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I owe the guy from fantasy football. I owe him money. I've got a seventy five dollar check but I owe him more than that and I've got some money in the account for it but I've got this condo that everything's getting wrapped up. And then there's my crazy condo... You know, they want a bill. ","P1-N400D91":"You know? And then I get an e-mail from the disenfranchised trustee, you know, asking me all these questions and I say, you know... She always says, you know, "I'm a trustee," so like I should give her advice just because she's a trustee. [00:25:03]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: But I'm like, you know, "We had a fucking twenty thousand dollar judgment against this woman and her claim is total bunk." So if she ever wants to bring it back... You know? I'm glad we didn't sign a release. You know? Because is she wants to go forward again it's going to bite her in the ass. ","P1-N400E11":"I'm not going to be the accountant on it. No fucking way. Unless they give me five thousand bucks up front. But I think I did the right thing. You know? But I've got to put a final bill to these people. Even though I've got nothing going on this week I was like, you know, "I do my billing at the beginning ","P1-N400E12":"of the month." I'll do it next week. [00:26:57]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: You want to pay my time? Now if she actually went to the board of our overseers they may actually say she's right and entitled to that because you would need to explain your bill. But my answer is, "The trust requested me to do these things."
THERAPIST: And your bill doesn't necessarily mean having a record...
CLIENT: Yeah. And I'm going to put that in my...
THERAPIST: ...a record of who...
CLIENT: I'm going to send a letter...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...you know, saying, "The engagement is finished. You know, my obligations are done and this is my normal billing practice. I have no obligation to say who requested each activity but I will say that these activities were requested by the trust a majority of the trustees," and then leave it at that. [00:29:01]
THERAPIST: Oh. (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) I'm like (inaudible at 00:30:43) so... I e-mail back Brian, "I'm a fucking asshole. I've got a wedding on Sunday." To which he e-mails me back, "Unless it's your wedding, skip it." [00:31:01]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: For some reason Larry texted me. I can't remember what he texted me about and I told him I was missing Firefly and that, you know, "This wedding better be one fucking hell of a party."
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: In fact, I said, "You're supplying the acid to everyone." You know? It will be just an out of control bash. Someone will get arrested. Someone will get arrested or in a fight. That will happen.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: These are just my friend from college. (LAUGHTER) At least his woman is going to be there so he tones it down but Larry is my asshole, my drunken asshole friend. You know? One of my drunken asshole friends.
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) [00:31:57]
CLIENT: So it's like, you know, I can't even go to fucking Firefly. I want to go to Larry's wedding. In fact Larry ended up calling me because we started talking about Phish (ph). And I was only going to go to the last day of Phish because I was... You know, Brian and Will can't go. This guy Benji is ","P1-N4010F1":"doing this firework thing up in Massachusetts.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: It sounded pretty cool so I was like, "Oh, I'll go that."
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And in fact the woman who I messaged who didn't message me back, she was like, "Why are you only going to one show?" You know? But Larry's going to all three shows. I'm like, you know, "Fuck the fireworks." You know? I'm going to go to Phish with Larry. You know? So Larry calls me and, you know, ","P1-N401171":"we were chatting on the phone, whatever and I just... I don't know. You know? And then yesterday, you know, there's a school at the end of my street and every day, you know, I come here, I go right, I go into work, I take a left. You know? There's the traffic guard, this old, you know, this old black ","P1-N401172":"dude. And all the parents wave to him so I've tried waving to him before. Never waved back. [00:33:05]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So I'm like, you know, "Be a nice guy. Let the kid fucking go." So I stop. The kid comes out. Dickhead starts coming across and he starts muttering to me. I'm like, "Are you fucking kidding me? You know, it's not like you were in the crosswalk with your stop sign for this kid. You know? I had ","P1-N4011D1":"the right to be in that cross walk. The kid wasn't in the crosswalk. He wasn't even at the fucking curb. You know? But I'm ready to take the fucking high road." [00:34:09]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I'm like totally trying to take the high road and this guy blows me off. You know? And I'm like, you know, "No good deed goes unpunished." You know? And, you know, just because it's the type of person Olivia is I'm trying to be more positive about things. I'm trying to, you know, just, you know... ","P1-N401231":"I've used this against her in the whole... I used it in the separation thing. [00:35:01]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...made me feel shittier about the whole thing. I'm like, you know, "I want to get off these fucking meds." I'm tired of them. Clearly I'm not in any position whatsoever to go off the meds. You know? I'm just...
THERAPIST: Well (inaudible at 00:36:41) especially the stuff with Olivia is really a fucking roller coaster for you. You haven't been down in a while and it's really because of that.
CLIENT: Oh I know.
THERAPIST: Which is something that you've avoided doing because you've been so scared about it because, you know, it was going to be an emotional roller coaster because it is. I'm not saying you shouldn't do it. I'm not saying that it doesn't suck that it is but, you know, you really taken on something...
CLIENT: The impression...
THERAPIST: ...that's a lot more. [00:37:09]
CLIENT: The impression that I got from a lot of these women on the site is that they wanted to chit chat and they wanted to meet quickly.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So, you know, and that's kind of the way it's, the few women who have shown interest that's... "Let's go have drinks." And it's not like that with her and that's why I never asked her out until after a week.
THERAPIST: Yep.
CLIENT: You know? She... I trust her that she didn't make up that she had plans but, you know, there's definitely some stalling going on here. And, you know, it's like I get upset one minute and then she says something the next minute that, you know... Like the message this morning, "I'm not like other ","P1-N4013F1":"women." You know? And then the winky. You know?
THERAPIST: Right. [00:37:55]
CLIENT: What the fuck does that mean? Is that, you know? And clearly there's some interest.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: There's got to me more than some interest because...
THERAPIST: Yeah. She's talking to people.
CLIENT: She's talking to people.
THERAPIST: She's texting people. Sure.
CLIENT: She took their advice and followed up with me, given me a second chance. You know? So I don't know. It just... It's too much. It's all too much. It's that but there's all these other things thrown in. You know? It just... The money thing. I don't want to fucking call my dad and ask for money. ","P1-N4014F1":"You know? I really don't. And maybe I'm going to get a red check from my tenant. But it's like, you know, I've got to fucking send some money to my landlord. It's like, you know, four months now and he's going to say something. You know? He's being overly nice about this. And he keeps thanking me for ","P1-N4014F2":"being understanding about the construction. He's kind of actually surprised that I'm putting up with it. You know? It doesn't bother me. Just... It' doesn't bother me. [00:39:15]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Kind of said yes but it hasn't happened yet. And then at (inaudible at 00:39:43) some document from the seventies in Lowell. So now it's like now I've got to go to fucking Lowell. It's probably in special storage where they're going to have to order it. So I went to order it from special storage. ","P1-N401551":"They never fucking called me back and I never got the file. [00:40:01]
THERAPIST: We have to stop.
CLIENT: Yeah. Oh. Happy Good Friday.
THERAPIST: Thanks.
CLIENT: And I really shouldn't be drinking tonight. I'm going to do something stupid. I'm almost tempted to...
