TITLE: Client "S", Session March 31, 2014: Client discusses not liking where their life has gone and feeling like nothing matters.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses not liking where their life has gone and feeling like nothing matters.
CLIENT: I should have just not gone to work today at all. Because, you know, I worked on Saturday and stuff on those stupid conferences. But yeah, when did I see you last?
THERAPIST: Wednesday? Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. So it was a long three days. Thursday, Friday and Saturday I had to be in at 7:00 each day. And then I was done at 1:00 on Saturday. Oh, my roommate lost her job again.
THERAPIST: I didn�t think she had any job, but I guess so.
CLIENT: It didn�t last very long. She apparently � This is what happened. She got � So, the reason her other job ended was because it was through a temp agency. And they extended � Her contract had ended with them, with the Timberline Company. But then they kept extending ","P1-N400131":"it �cause they had a need for more work or whatever. But then they just couldn�t extend it anymore. So that�s why that ended. [1:29] And then she was like, lying on the couch like, oh, the temp agency has my application. So I�m just going to lie here and eat Nutella instead ","P1-N400132":"of like, bagging groceries or something. And so then she gets this job with TJ Maxx, TJX or whatever. And she � it�s like a big title. And she�s like, oh, it�s going great. I�m still temp for the three month trial period. And they could hire, da, da, da. But it�s ","P1-N400133":"a permanent position.
THERAPIST: I get the impression that you didn�t especially want to be here today.
CLIENT: No, I did. Yes, I do.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: Well, I guess �cause I�m just feeling like I hate my life. (pause) And last night Sergio finally came over. I�ve been trying to get together with him all week. And I was actually trying to give this a chance a little bit. Maybe I should just try to be patient and give him ","P1-N4001F1":"the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he, whatever. But then we got to talking finally, even though obviously, I felt like it would ruin it. You know, like basically, he doesn�t want a relationship, so doesn�t want to lead me on. [6:49] So that�s why whatever.
THERAPIST: Wait � why do you mean that�s why, whatever?
CLIENT: That�s why we�re not a real relationship. That�s why he never � that�s why he doesn�t � isn�t really dating me. And if I were ready � �cause I have too many other things that I�m dealing with. And if I were ready for ","P1-N400231":"a relationship, obviously you�d be the person that I would want to be with. I was like, okay. This is stupid. If you wanted to be with me, you would just be with me. It doesn�t matter. (pause) [7:51]
THERAPIST: I see. So there are a bunch of things that suck. Like, Sergio and your job and your roommate.
CLIENT: Mm hmm. (Indicating yes) I mean, I feel like my life sucks. Like, it�s boring and sucks. [8:48] I�m like, jogging in place. (pause) [9:41] [10:38] [11:41] I have nothing to say either. (pause)
THERAPIST: Well, okay. So what happened with the appointment stuff here? I�m not actually trying to sound punitive about it. I just am trying to figure out what�s going on in that?
CLIENT: Okay, well, we have an event tonight at 6:00, so I had to cancel the 4:30. And then, I said, sure, 12:45 today, because then I was like, I don�t want to wait until Thursday and then see you twice in a row. [12:39] And then I got involved with talking to my assistant and forgot, and then ","P1-N4002B1":"said, well I can come at 4:30 instead, because I had already -
THERAPIST: �Cause now you more about -
CLIENT: �Cause I had just talked to her, and she said that she would stay and work the event, so that I could leave early, since I worked on Saturday and 55 hours last week and was tired and didn�t want to be there.
THERAPIST: Well, I�m glad in any case that you could leave early and don�t have to go to the event tonight. That�s a good thing.
CLIENT: Thanks. But that�s what happened with that.
THERAPIST: So you�re just feeling too annoyed and shitty to want to talk much about it still?
CLIENT: No, I just � What am I supposed to say? [13:27] That everything is annoying and shitty? It�s not that I�m too annoyed to talk, it�s that I -
THERAPIST: You don�t have to say beyond what you�ve already said about it.
CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like I hate what my life turned into. (pause) After Franklin left, and it�s stupid, because I hated what my life turned into with Franklin. So now I�m confused as to what was really worse. (pause) [14:30] [15:47] [16:41] [17:43]
THERAPIST: I�ve got the impression that maybe you�re too disappointed and so pissed off, and so ashamed I think, that you just feel shut down. Like you�re so full of all that stuff that it�s like you can�t really even think. [18:33]
CLIENT: �Cause all I can think about is how unhappy I am. (crying)
THERAPIST: I don�t know that I�ve seen you feel this dark before.
CLIENT: I don�t know that I�ve felt this stuff before. Except for maybe certain points of my relationship with Franklin, which of course, is ironic. [19:36] (pause) [20:30] I feel like I don�t know what to do anymore, so it doesn�t matter if I do anything. I don�t ","P1-N400431":"even care what I�m doing. Just sitting at home and not exercising, eating whatever I want. Drinking. Smoking pot. I don�t care. That�s how I feel right now. Like, I don�t really have anybody calling me to make plans or anything anyway.
THERAPIST: You�ve kind of given up. [21:40]
CLIENT: Mm hmm. (Indicating yes) I feel like even if I don�t � even if I get back into my exercises and I�m eating right and whatever like, it doesn�t make a difference. It doesn�t matter either way, whatever I do. [22:30] (pause) [23:24]
THERAPIST: We should stop for now.
CLIENT: Okay. I�ll see you on Friday.
