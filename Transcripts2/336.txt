TITLE: Client "J", Session February 04, 2014: Client discusses miscommunication in current relationship due to alcohol use.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses miscommunication in current relationship due to alcohol use.
THERAPIST: I (inaudible) you a bill. Yeah.
CLIENT: Nah. I’ve had a rough couple days.
THERAPIST: Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it’s, you know—I want to say, you know, a lot of it’s like most things is—there’s a very small part of it where I’m a victim of circumstance.
THERAPIST: (laughter) That was very candid. (laughter)
CLIENT: Don’t try to (crosstalk 00:00:39) those instances. But I think the rest of it was, you know. So, I wasn’t feeling good on Saturday and Marcia was throwing a 50th birthday party for her sister. But her brother-in-law and a friend of her sister’s. And it was very stressful, you ","P1-N400151":"know. Bands breaking up and cancelling and, you know. Does she know? You know all the shit that goes along with it, you know. And I had taken Ian rock climbing. Of course, I did the rock climbing. I got belaying burn from the rope there. But I think I just kind of overdid it. I really didn’t feel ","P1-N400152":"well. I was nauseous. I was just exhausted. I was just like, you know. And then it was any other thing I was just blowing it off, you know. Like I can’t blow this off. [00:01:37]
THERAPIST: Oh, I see. Yeah. [00:05:22]
CLIENT: And she, of course, heard the exact opposite. Well, you know, I didn’t realize this until I woke up at about a quarter to four and the light is on in the bedroom. She’s not there. And I get up. I’m half asleep. I’m half drunk. I walk out. I see her. You know, and I don’t ","P1-N400211":"know why, but whatever the encounter was I got angry. You know, just, you know—I don’t know what she—I didn’t even know what she said to me. I went to the bathroom and I’m stewing as I’m in the bathroom. Like, “What the fuck?” I don’t even know what ","P1-N400212":"I was upset about. I really don’t. [00:05:59]
THERAPIST: Yeah. That sucks.
CLIENT: You know, it’s funny because I’m like trying to predict like the next thing that’s just going to knock me down. And I was like, “Oh, you know, it’s probably going to be Marcia dumping me for something stupid,” you know. Not to say this was something stupid, ","P1-N400331":"but, you know. And then, you know, the reality is it’s like—I mean you could say in some respect I was a coward. I just didn’t want to deal with whatever was there and left, you know. But I was just, you know—I shouldn’t have been driving home. That’s for damn sure. ","P1-N400332":"I was all fucking, you know, Watertown cop—Watertown cop, Framingham cop. (inaudible) people in there. [00:13:32]
THERAPIST: It sounds like you’ve been rolling with this pretty well since it happened actually.
CLIENT: (laughter) I’ve been obsessed with it, you know. You know, I don’t know what happened. I was wrong. I’m sorry from the bottom of my heart. What hurts me the most is that it hurt you. You did nothing to deserve this and it shouldn’t happen to someone as sweet as you. And ","P1-N400391":"that’s all true, you know. You know, and, you know, then I’m like I’m not making excuses. Life’s been difficult, you know. I struggle every day, you know. You’re a bright, shining star, you know. I’m much happier when I’m with her, you know. I don’t feel ","P1-N400392":"bad, you know. I forgot that, you know. The IRS. You know, we owe them instead of thinking it’s going to be about two grand, it was four grand. And I got a 1099, which is going to make it another five to a thousand dollars, you know. [00:15:31]
THERAPIST: You seem to have rolled with it. Like I said, I understand you’re preoccupied. You’ve been really upset about it. You’ve been feeling down. You’ve been feeling kind of helpless. But you haven’t really lost your shit. You haven’t, you know, gotten all pissed ","P1-N4003D1":"off and basically stormed out again as far as I can tell.
CLIENT: Again.
THERAPIST: Again. Yeah. Again. You haven’t, you know—or like gotten all pissed off and let her have it. You know you say some stuff you meant. [00:17:30]
CLIENT: Well, I’ve learned my lessons. Some of them, you know. And, you know, I kind of—I learned it from my clients, who are unwilling to settle on principle, you know. And that principle gets you nowhere. It costs you. You know, it costs you. For these people, it might be money, you know. So.
THERAPIST: I have a piece of it—you know, I never advise—I have a piece of advice. Which is like—
CLIENT: Get her flowers.
THERAPIST: No. That’s not like a bad idea, but that wasn’t what I had in mind. (laughter) I would try like—it seems to me pretty legit and probably a good idea if it—after whatever 11? 12:00 at night or if you’re pretty trashed to just not have conversations about heavy things. [00:18:46]
CLIENT: Yeah. I agree, you know. And that was—you know, and I don’t know how to—you know, because we usually don’t, you know. And I don’t know what happened here because, you know, (crosstalk).
THERAPIST: If you were in your right mind, I don’t think it would have gone that way.
CLIENT: Yeah. You know, clearly, she was, you know—but I think what it was is she was really drunk and emotional. You know, that’s the same thing that happened at the wedding, you know. She was drunk and emotional, you know. And—
THERAPIST: Right. I guess you need a way of dealing where of that where it deescalates things rather than— [00:19:24]
CLIENT: You know, and I’ve got, you know—I mean there’s parts where, you know, where I can see, you know, it used to happen like with Jess. You know, it’s here. Have a couple of drinks too many. And, you know, I would take the approach of, “Hey, you know, why don’t ","P1-N400531":"you slow down. You’re having too drink,” you know. And which is no good, but with Marcia I just point out her behavior towards me that’s unacceptable. And she’s like, “Oh, okay,” you know and she gets it, you know. But I was caught off guard here, you know. I didn’t ","P1-N400532":"even—I was—you know, and—you know, it’s not just that I’ve been drinking, but, you know, I’m kind of taking a (inaudible 00:20:05), you know. So, I’m exhausted. It’s the staying awake. I’m just so tired, you know. That’s all the meds are doing ","P1-N400533":"is making me more tired and more tired, you know. And, you know.
THERAPIST: You, at some point had said like I just can’t do this right now. I’ve got to go to bed.
CLIENT: That’s what I should have said. And, you know, that’s probably what—
THERAPIST: It felt so hard. Is (crosstalk) judgment.
CLIENT: That’s almost what I did to her. Like I don’t give a shit. Don’t put this on me and I rolled over and I went to bed.
THERAPIST: Yeah. She kind of wouldn’t let it go.
CLIENT: Or that’s what, you know, she tells me happened. So. (pause 00:20:51 00:20:59) and I feel like, you know, I’ve got a—can’t change people. This is not going to be an anomaly. At least, you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah. It happens every once in a while with her.
CLIENT: And you know it was funny because when I called her and she was setting up for the party, you know—because it’s at the BFW, so they’re giving the, you know—like give him a quarter and they give you seven drinks or whatever, you know. You know, you know, I could already ","P1-N400631":"tell she was getting tipsy. She was like, “I’m fine.” And I’m like—and so, I’m thinking to myself, you know, I was here. You know, is this going to be one of those nights where, you know, she’s just going to be giving shit or getting mad at me? Or, you know, ","P1-N400632":"and I said, “Whatever you do, you know, this is her night. This is her party. She’s been very stressed out. You know, you’ve got to be supportive and just roll with it.” [00:22:02]
THERAPIST: What was it that you did to the—I’m a little confused of what you did that was so awful. According to her, I know— [00:23:11]
CLIENT: I think if I stayed everything would have been okay. (pause 00:23:15 [00:23:19) But I got up and left because I’m just like, “She’s out on the couch. I’m fucking in here.” I’m like, you know, super anxious, mad, you know, panoply of emotions. And just I ","P1-N400691":"don’t know. I felt like I had to get out of there, you know. And, you know, I’ve gotten the feeling before, but it’s never really—it’s passing and fleeting, you know. (pause 00:23:48 00:23:55) And I felt, you know—I was glad she finally sent that long text last ","P1-N400692":"night because it’s like, you know, this is something I wish you would have—I would have known Sunday morning, you know.
THERAPIST: I mean yea. It really sounds like she didn’t make this easy.
CLIENT: Of course not. I can’t say that to her, you know. That’s her personality. I’ve accepted that, you know. (pause 00:27:27 00:27:56) And I could never, never bring that up, you know. She doesn’t make it easy.
THERAPIST: No. You never can.
CLIENT: (pause 00:28:04 00:28:16) I’m not saying I’ve done everything right, you know. But I’m a pretty good guy. I’m a pretty good boyfriend. I drive down there all the fucking time, you know. I drove down there to take care of her dogs. And, you know, I’m not looking ","P1-N400771":"for credit. You know, I enjoy doing it, you know. But, you know, I would think that she would do the same thing for me. But it’s times like this where, you know, I’m looking for a little—built up a little something, you know. The box is done. I can’t use that one again. Well, ","P1-N400772":"I mean, at least in this situation. I keep the, you know, the box. (yawning) (pause 00:29:05 00:29:08) She said it was thoughtful which, you know, is better than nothing. But, you know—
THERAPIST: A little more reserved than you were hoping for?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: (pause 00:29:21 00:29:28) Well, that has worked. I mean she’s coming around.
CLIENT: Yeah. It’s just taking a lot longer than I wanted and it’s been sheer fucking hell. (pause 00:29:37 00:29:49) And luckily, I’ve just been tired, exhausted, and unable to sleep for, you know, 22 hours of the day. Not that much. (pause 00:29:57 00:30:15) (coughing) (pause ","P1-N4007F1":"00:30:17 00:30:36) And I don’t know where I am. It’s the other thing is I just don’t know where I am right now. It’s like today I know I got to go to the office. I know I got to do a few things. I feel like I just don’t know where I am and, you know, it felt like I was ","P1-N4007F2":"on this road to getting things done and, you know, I even a couple new clients this weekend. (yawning) I don’t know. I just—(pause 00:31:01 00:31:08) right now I’m just so fucking tired. I mean I took a Klonopin.
THERAPIST: (pause 00:31:11 00:31:18) Well, and you’ve just gone over it all again. You’ve probably been thinking about it a lot.
CLIENT: (pause 00:31:23 00:31:55) (coughing) (pause 00:31:56 00:32:59) (coughing) (pause 00:32:59 00:33:04) I’ve got this like nose thing that just won’t stop. It’s been like—(inaudible) or what. (pause 00:33:18 00:33:24) So, yeah. We got (coughing)—oye. We get ","P1-N400831":"our taxes. And Jess’ all, “I’m paying the money,” you know. (pause 00:33:38 00:33:50) What happened was is last year we were allowed to take a $40,000 loss for losses in previous years that were disallowed for whatever reason. Well, for some reason last year, we were allowed ","P1-N400832":"to take them. And, you know, remove that $40,000 and we went from, you know, a loss from the rentals to a gain. You know, and that means higher estimated taxes this year. Probably have to pay some state taxes this year which means we’re going to have to pay state estimated taxes.
THERAPIST: Jess did?
CLIENT: Yeah. And I was like oh, you know—and then I look back and I said, “Well, you know, who’s going to be reading this,” you know? A judge, you know. A law school professor. I said no. These are people who are going to read it, boom, you know. And there needs to be words ","P1-N400891":"that are going to jump out. (coughing) And prominent though definitionally doesn’t—you know, they are prominent changes. Everybody’s seen them. I mean, you know. But I think the word just is more kind of jumps out at you. So, I disregarded all her changes. Left a copy as is. We’ll ","P1-N400892":"see how it goes. I like it, you know. (pause 00:37:28 00:37:35) Of course, now I think I’m not going to make any money, but that’s a different story. (pause 00:37:39 00:37:46) It’s kind of weird at the (coughing) networking meeting on Thursday. There was a board. There’s ","P1-N400893":"officers. Everybody’s got jobs except for me and maybe one or two other people.
THERAPIST: This is in the new—
CLIENT: The new (inaudible) group. Yeah. And it was awkward, you know. And then as I was kind of leaving, Hunter, who is kind of taking the reins, is like, “Well, we’ll have something for you.” Well, everybody’s supposed to have something. Just I don’t know. I don’t ","P1-N4008D1":"know why I was not thought of, you know, to be, you know—is I think (coughing) that Patricia was—really thought I was stressed out. Maybe she thought you just need some time or something like that which doesn’t work with me. I spend more time like what? They don’t want me. (coughing) ","P1-N4008D2":"They don’t value my opinion. I don’t know. But it’s weird just sitting in the whole fucking and it’s boring as hell. God, my throat. (pause 00:38:57 00:39:08) Sometimes you have less buggers in the last couple days though.
THERAPIST: You must be pretty wiped out.
CLIENT: Hmm?
THERAPIST: You must be pretty wiped out. I mean you’re not even sleeping a lot just from the stuff that’s (inaudible)
CLIENT: (coughing) (pause 00:39:24 00:40:02) I should have grabbed my little printer. (pause 00:40:06 00:40:14) (coughing)
THERAPIST: (pause 00:40:17 00:40:28) Yeah. You should take it easy.
CLIENT: (pause 00:40:29 00:40:37) I should have taken it easy for a long time, you know. (pause 00:40:41 00:40:50) But even, you know, Georgia was supposed to be taking it easy, you know. (pause 00:40:54 00:41:18) All the Klonopin in my system is not helping. (pause 00:41:21 00:41:25) Finding ","P1-N400991":"I’m forgetting and not taking my afternoon Adderall when I think it’s affecting me. Getting work done in the afternoon. (pause 00:41:37 00:41:53) There’s this dad, Rob, soccer league. His kid is a beast. The kid looks like he’s 13. Fucking (inaudible). I told him. I said, “Let ","P1-N400992":"me see your kid’s driver’s license,” you know.
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: Ian doesn’t like school. He doesn’t want to go to school. The vice president yells at people. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Hey, Ian, do you like (inaudible)?” “Oh, yeah.” “Do you got a lot of friends?” “Oh yeah.” Yeah. And of course, she ","P1-N4009F1":"tells me this like two days after I replied being (inaudible) parent. (clears throat) We got to stop, you know. It’s been 45 minutes. I’ll try to remember those. I’m pretty sure that check’s for you though.
THERAPIST: Feel better.
