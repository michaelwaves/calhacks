DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the fear of being unable to communicate.
THERAPIST: Also, I looked over billing yesterday, and it is basically the same bill for December. Remember?
CLIENT: OK.
THERAPIST: So you’re OK.
CLIENT: OK.
CLIENT: So, yeah, work [ph] was OK.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: Let’s see. Mm, [pauses] my aunt and uncle and cousin came from out there [ph] with my little sister [ph], and that was nice. Yeah, it is kind of nice to have someone else kind of there, kind of enduring the parents [ph] with me. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: But…
THERAPIST: Camaraderie.
CLIENT: Right. And – yeah, I mean, [pauses] I used to get kind of frustrated at my parents, like the way they do things, and I think they’re very loud and – but I just feel very stuck in my ways and…
THERAPIST: Uh-huh?
CLIENT: I’m not going to be able to change anything or – it is just kind of me [pauses] just kind of – I guess, just kind of putting up with and just kind of being there for whatever they want to do. But… [00:02:00]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: But I think I’ll be OK. Luckily, my boss is gone for two weeks, so that always shuts the boom [ph] to have [chuckles]…
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. So the guy is off for the next two weeks. [00:03:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: So I think I’ll be OK to kind of transition back in, without [pauses] – and move on [ph].
CLIENT: And I guess, yeah, I should be getting hearing back from grad schools [ph] this month. [00:04:00]
THERAPIST: Oh, wow.
CLIENT: And I – I worry about it and then [pauses] – I guess I go back and forth between being kind of extremely worried and then I just don’t think about it. It is just the waiting game is hard.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Yeah. And some schools are very specific, like dual enroll [ph] by the state, and so they’re like, “You’ll know two weeks before the interview.”
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And the other days are to be announced. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: So it is kind of like, “All right, well, I guess I’ll see.” And so…
CLIENT: I guess I don’t really [pauses for ten seconds] – there is – yeah, I haven’t really [pauses] thought through things or – other than small worries, though, like school – or grad school and going back to work. I haven’t really…
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: …Thought a lot about me or – I’ve just kind of kept very kind of surface.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: I don’t know. [Pauses] [00:06:00]
CLIENT: I guess I’ve just been kind of thinking about how [pauses] – just being up early because I am on time.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And energy to do things that I want to do, or [pauses] – even like also just being more pleasant, more like – maybe a movie [ph] or something. But…
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: …I guess I’m just kind of – yeah, kind of worried about just maintaining that.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But – I don’t know.
THERAPIST: You seem [ph] kind of in a good mood now.
CLIENT: [Faintly] Right.
THERAPIST: I mean, I understand you’re worried about that changing. [00:07:59]
CLIENT: Right. And [pauses] – yeah, I’m just – yeah, because I’m worried about – because as soon as – because I feel like very – I’m going to get into that habit of how I was before.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And – I don’t know – I don’t – I guess I get that way because I can’t do the things I want to do to make myself feel better, or – but then – but then I worry, if I cut away from work or whatever, then I worry too much about it or something.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: I’m never [pauses] – [inaudible at 00:08:45]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But [pauses]… [00:09:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess [clears throat] [pauses] I want to take a little of what you’re saying to me about being with your parents, how they seem – and they’re kind of loud and set in their ways and… [00:10:05]
CLIENT: I mean, I guess I’m sort of – yeah, I think I’ve said this before, but I don’t want to be so affected or consumed by things that happen or… [pauses] [00:11:08]
THERAPIST: I guess I imagine things are going to function [ph] one way or another, and that you also worry about that. But, sometimes, it is like it was having your cousins at home where you feel like some camaraderie or the [inaudible at 00:11:54] to air a little bit the things that you’re feeling ","P1-N4008D1":"stressed out about or crowded by. [00:12:01]
CLIENT: Right. [Pauses for seven seconds] I guess the feeling of just being – not knowing what to think or do, or [pauses] or just… [00:13:00]
CLIENT: I guess I get just kind of mad – I don’t know – if things don’t change or that I get sent an e-mail [ph] like my parents…
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: …That they don’t do more to [pauses for five seconds] – just kind of help the situation or make it better [inaudible at 00:14:33] or – I don’t know. They’re just kind of like [pauses for five seconds] there is no [pauses]… [00:15:00]
CLIENT: So, yeah, I guess I just get confused of what to think or just like, “Oh,” or [pauses]… [00:17:00]
THERAPIST: Counting things that have happened [ph], there were – it seems like you’re feeling more overwhelmed now. And I’m not sure it was sort of, in part, reaction to my comment about the thing that you’re going either way. [00:18:04]
CLIENT: I guess I’ve just been frustrated...
THERAPIST: Uh-huh?
CLIENT: … [Pauses] with myself and, yeah, just with them [ph]. [Pauses for eight seconds] I was making up my mind… [00:19:03]
CLIENT: I don’t know. I guess it [sighs] – I don’t know. [Pauses for eight seconds] Things never have – get – I’ve dealt [ph] with this relation, kind of switching between [pauses] extremes.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Worrying and avoidance, or trying to let it go, but… [00:21:07]
THERAPIST: My sense is that [clears throat] that often seems partly to do with things around you but that you get mad at yourself because you feel you should be able to kind of roll with or manage those things much better.
CLIENT: Right. Or is – so…
THERAPIST: It could be some big stressful thing at work, and, clearly, that is not easy, but you get mad at yourself because your sense is that most people could find a way to deal with that [pauses] better than you.
CLIENT: Right. [Pauses] [00:21:59]
THERAPIST: I wonder if some of this [clears throat] from the [pauses] fear or even terror of not being able – or I’ll just say not being able to kind of [pauses]… [00:24:00]
CLIENT: I’m not sure… [pauses]
CLIENT: I’m not sure [pauses]…
CLIENT: I mean, [pauses for ten seconds] yeah, it often means, [ph] [pauses] to me, just being more confused about having to do something I don’t want to do, or [pauses for eight seconds] or [loud sound] think about something I don’t want to think about. [00:29:01]
CLIENT: I guess, yeah, I mean [pauses for 12 seconds] – yeah, I guess I just kind of worry that I don’t really know what to say or [pauses]…
THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like [pauses for 12 seconds]…
CLIENT: Or it should be something [pauses for five seconds] that I can deal with or something that shouldn’t even bother me.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: [Clears throat] [00:36:00]
THERAPIST: I see the first problem is letting the other person know you have a problem in the first place. [00:37:00]
CLIENT: Right. [Pauses]
THERAPIST: Not because [pauses] it depends who it is or on the situations, that they may give you a hard time or be critical, or not be helpful, or whatever. But it seems like, even before that is something that comes from your own feelings about having told them. [Pauses]
CLIENT: Right. It is almost [ph] – I don’t want to be like a burden or give them something they can judge me on, or… [00:38:01]
THERAPIST: It isn’t that you have a very strong feeling in that sense, of where they might be coming from and then they won’t be somewhere good. [00:41:04]
CLIENT: I think it is just [pauses] not – just feeling embarrassed and not up [ph], especially if you know that person, that you’re told [ph] their true feelings or what they’re really thinking or…
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: I guess that, for me [ph] deciding [ph] who I can be very frightening. [00:44:00]
CLIENT: [Faintly] Yeah.
THERAPIST: It feels very hard to trust to get where [ph] we’re coming from [pauses for five seconds] or [pauses] dangerous.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Well, we should stop.
CLIENT: I know. [Pauses] It will be the first day back [ph].
