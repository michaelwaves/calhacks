TITLE: Client "K", Session January 20, 2014: Client discusses feeling stuck and dealing with anxiety.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses feeling stuck and dealing with anxiety.
THERAPIST: I actually had a thought as we were wrapping up on Thursday that I was going—or on Wednesday. That I was going to then tell you Thursday, but then, I had to be out.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yes, you said?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. That seems like a pretty central thing to you, too? This [kind of thing] (ph) that I’m talking about, yeah? All right.
THERAPIST: I’ve had a little bit—right. [00:05:02] So, then, I guess I’m pretty aware that what I’ve just described . . . is really what it’s like. I have an alternative point of view on it, which goes like this: So, for example, apply to things here. Your experience is, ","P1-N400271":"in a way, of being faced with a practical problem. Namely, what do you do about this? Both, in a way, while you’re here and more broadly. (inaudible at 00:05:57) come if it feels like . . . we’re not getting you through this impasse? [00:06:09]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah. So, that’s a practical problem. And it’s an important one.
THERAPIST: . . . when you’re here with me and . . . you know that I see it and you also, I think, feel some sense that we’re helpless in it together. [00:08:00]
THERAPIST: And I think it—you . . . I think that’s really where you have trouble, is with the emotional side of all this. And I think you get a little focused on the practical side. Which is very real and very important, but I think you do it a little bit . . . in an effort to help settle ","P1-N4003F1":"yourself down, because just staying with the emotional side is so God damn overwhelming. I mean, I really think it’s horrible. I mean, what I mean is (ph) it feels really bad. [00:13:02]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I don’t think my laying it out this way is any kind of solution or procedural manual . . . for how to deal with these situations. [00:14:09] I’m saying I’m trying to reframe a little bit where I think you get stuck and why. And how I think you—and I think the kind ","P1-N400471":"of things that we can work on to help make it better. Which involve . . . gradually coming to tolerate and . . . deal with the anxiety of and get more clarity about or understanding of what’s going on when this happens. [00:15:04] Why it’s so overwhelming. Getting used to that in a way that ","P1-N400472":"helps you feel more settled when it’s going on, so that you can think, in a sense, where you’re actually at in any individual situation where you’re stuck and this comes up.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess I thought it might be helpful for me to . . . at least, in a sort of conceptual way, provide a kind of overview, a (inaudible at 00:15:51) of what I think you’re having trouble with.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So, I guess, first, is that . . . am I being clear? Do you have questions about what I’ve laid out? Are there parts of it that either don’t make sense or don’t seem right or? [00:18:00]
CLIENT: It seems right. I guess . . . I don’t know. I guess it makes me a little anxious to, I guess, because I’m immediately drawn (ph) to—I don’t know. Problems that—I don’t know. Being stuck in a situation—I don’t know. I was thinking, “Oh, I’ll ","P1-N400571":"never know what the right thing to do,” or . . . or, I don’t know. I don’t want to be wrong in my conviction. I don’t know. That’s just what I was thinking of (crosstalk at 00:18:52).
THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, I think . . . [00:19:00] Yeah. It sounds like you immediately went to feeling disarmed. Anticipating dealing with situations that are overwhelming.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Which . . . is the very anxiety that I’m referring to. And that is so difficult. [00:20:00]
THERAPIST: I guess at the . . . at the end of the days, there’s something more immediately interpersonal in this that I’m having a little trouble yet getting ahold of.
THERAPIST: But that I think we can—we will learn more about as we continue to investigate.
THERAPIST: Tell me more. So, you were immediately thinking of—because I think I missed something, here. You were immediately thinking of situations where you need to have answers or you need to decide what to do.
CLIENT: Right. Or I don’t—I don’t know. I don’t want to be wrong or arrogant or, yeah. I don’t know. [00:22:00] I don’t know. To me, it seems like a lot of times where I get stuck, it’s a problem of—I don’t know. Battling knowing what I want and ","P1-N4006D1":"knowing what I think I should do. I don’t know. I get scared to make a—I don’t know. Choice or—I don’t know. So, I think (inaudible at 00:22:38) just (inaudible at 00:22:38), I don’t know. But I guess it’s hard for me, I don’t know. I guess to trust myself ","P1-N4006D2":"or to, I don’t know, make a decision. [00:23:00]
CLIENT: I guess when I ask, I guess, whoever, “What do I do?” or—it’s not (ph) like—I don’t know. [00:24:09] It’s not what decision do I make. It’s more like how do I think about the situation or—I don’t know. (inaudible at 00:24:24) one, don’t ","P1-N400711":"get stuck, or two, I know what the answer or something. What do I do to prevent (crosstalk at 00:24:33)?
THERAPIST: Well (ph), yeah. It often seems like more, “How do I get oriented to this?” or –
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I mean, if you were sitting in front of a math problem, it’s not so much like you’re asking what number or equation (inaudible at 00:24:52) the answer, but what kind of a problem is this? And what, in general, is the way to work on a problem like this? [00:25:00] Something more like that?
CLIENT: [Uh uh] (ph).
CLIENT: I don’t know. (inaudible at 00:25:16) I don’t know. It boils down to . . . not that I’ll never get out of this or I need a new way of thinking, so—or a new, I don’t know, awareness or something so I don’t get in these situations. I don’t allow myself ","P1-N4007D1":"to be in these situations. That’s what I think of. Or I think I want (inaudible at 00:25:54). [00:26:00]
THERAPIST: I feel like there’s a way in which, both with what I’ve said and—about we just stick with that. That I’m often throwing you into those situations, in a way, here. [00:27:02] Like when I say more about the—what comes up emotionally and the anxiety and the overwhelmingness. ","P1-N400811":"I know you know what I mean. I mean, you said (inaudible at 00:27:21) did that make sense to you?
CLIENT: Right. [00:28:00]
THERAPIST: And saying, “Well, actually, it’s about . . .”
THERAPIST: “. . . looking at how it makes you anxious and what is getting screwed up and all that. It’s not a lot to hold onto, I imagine.
CLIENT: Right. I don’t know. It’s pretty much crippling.
THERAPIST: It’s crippling? [00:29:01]
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know. I don’t know. Yeah, like when I’m trying to decide or going back and forth or trying to analyze it. And just asking, “So, what do I do? What do I do?” It’s just (inaudible at 00:29:35). I don’t do anything or it’s just sitting ","P1-N400911":"there, stewing. And I feel that (inaudible at 00:29:51) get out of it is to (inaudible at 00:29:53) I don’t know, be super-strict and push myself. I don’t know. Or get someone else to distract me or push me (inaudible at 00:30:05). [00:30:05]
THERAPIST: Yeah. That feels like somebody really reaching their hand out to you. Grabbing ahold of you while you’re in the midst of all of this. Whereas what I’m saying (inaudible at 00:30:43) though it feels much like more leaving you in it.
CLIENT: Right. [00:31:00] I guess I’m just explaining, I don’t know, why—yeah, I’m so—I don’t know. Or keep asking me, “What do I do?” I guess I feel like—I don’t know. (inaudible at 00:31:27) I’m just lost, I don’t know. I don’t ","P1-N400971":"know. It affects everything (inaudible at 00:31:33), or I don’t know. I’m less productive or (inaudible at 00:31:41).
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I guess I’m going to set some kind of—I mean, I agree with you, what you say that (inaudible at 00:33:05) you don’t think—I don’t know. [00:33:12] (inaudible at 00:33:13) or understanding more what’s going on, but (inaudible at 00:33:16) too ","P1-N4009F1":"critical and too—I don’t know. Shut down or (crosstalk at 00:33:25).
THERAPIST: I’m thinking about I wonder why. I’m not exactly posing this as a question for you to answer, but it seems like it’s a central question. Why it is that . . . the thing that works is having somebody step in and tell you how to look at something or tell you what to do? [00:34:00]
THERAPIST: I mean, there’s a way in which that . . . limits somewhat how you might choose to approach something or what you might feel is right. But I understand that sometimes, that’s not what matters immediately so much as getting unstuck or unlost. But the question is, through my mind . . . [00:35:00]
THERAPIST: I wonder why that’s the thing that . . . helps. And I guess what it must be is . . .
THERAPIST: . . . once you have moved forward a bit, you can think again. And you feel a lot less anxious. [00:36:00]
THERAPIST: And another way to say it, I guess, is that there’s something having a very decisive, controlling figure . . . who really takes over. [00:37:04] And that . . . makes you feel much better.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:37:23)
THERAPIST: What went with that, that’s in a way the person you need when you’re feeling lost.
CLIENT: [I don’t know] (ph). (inaudible at 00:37:53) [00:38:00] I mean, I don’t know that’s because they may have an opinion or—[I don’t know] (ph). Because they have that opinion, I don’t know, there’s some weird—I don’t know. I don’t know. ","P1-N400B71":"Know it’s right or something like that, or . . .
THERAPIST: Well, I guess you can have confidence in it. I mean, I would imagine in reality, there are times you look back and later on, felt like maybe most of the time, the advice was good. Maybe sometimes it wasn’t. But what really mattered was how it got you unstuck. [00:39:03]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: But in the moment . . . I guess you can hold onto that advice. And you can feel—because you can feel confident of it. Or have some faith in it, in a way.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:39:48)
THERAPIST: Yeah. Right. It can’t be just anybody off the street. [00:40:00] I mean [chuckles] it’s somebody like—I don’t know. I think the person comes to mind is Vicki. Somebody you know very well and knows you.
CLIENT: Right (ph).
CLIENT: I don’t know. I’m just thinking as, I don’t know, I need to push myself or I need to . . . I don’t know. [00:42:07] Yeah. I mean I need to, yeah, just—because I know what I could (ph) do to let go of myself. (inaudible at 00:42:20) more productive. But I get stuck. ","P1-N400CF1":"But I don’t know.
THERAPIST: I imagine it’s (inaudible at 00:42:30) pushing yourself to come here, actually. I don’t mean every day, you go, “Oh my fucking God, I have to go there again.” [laughs] Although maybe you do. I don’t know. But more like . . . not in all ways, but in some ways, ","P1-N400D11":"I mean, it really puts you right in the kind of thing you struggle with, where you just say whatever. I give you advice. [00:43:00] You’re often in this uncertain or confused place about what to do.
CLIENT: [I am] (ph), a little bit.
THERAPIST: I think that you’re in that place a lot in a lot of places. Sorry, go ahead.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:43:49) I don’t know. It’s not as hard. I don’t know. [00:44:00] It’s not as—I don’t know. I’m not walking in and out of the door or (inaudible at 00:44:07), I don’t know. So it’s easier just to (inaudible at 00:44:09).
THERAPIST: Well, we could stop (inaudible at 00:44:23).
