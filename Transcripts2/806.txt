DESCRIPTION: Client discusses watching a movie and the feelings that is brought up in her. Client feels guilty for wanting to cheat on her husband with her therapist.
CLIENT: How are you?
THERAPIST: I'm doing okay.
CLIENT: Had a silly (ph) morning where I got here a while ago and I thought I'd left the stove on and the back door open; so I went back and I hadn't. It doesn't happen that often that I think I've done those things.
CLIENT: I also don't usually cook in the morning, but I cooked some of dinner in the morning, which threw me off because I didn't have a habit of checking various things, like the stove being off. [00:01:05]
CLIENT: Are you excited for your break?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Good. Are you staying at home?
THERAPIST: No, I'm going (inaudible at 00:01:45).
CLIENT: Cool. The water here is so cold, still. [00:02:00] But in Virginia it's not cold. I think we're going to go [to the beach] (ph) in Virginia this weekend.
CLIENT: [Sighs]
CLIENT: Where do you on the Hamptons?
THERAPIST: Usually we go...
THERAPIST: ...on the upper Hamptons, the closer part of the Hamptons. But this time, we're going to the mid-Hamptons region, (inaudible at 00:03:44). It's a long story.
CLIENT: Hmm.
THERAPIST: Or we go to...the other end, [I think you'd] like (inaudible at 00:03:53).
CLIENT: Like really close?
THERAPIST: No, (inaudible at 00:03:59) is like the-it's (inaudible at 0:04:02).
CLIENT: Oh, yeah.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:04:03)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:04:06), traditionally where...in the 70s and 80s all the shrinks would take August off and go to Ventura (inaudible at 00:04:17). I mean, it doesn't happen like that anymore.
CLIENT: It doesn't? No (ph)?
THERAPIST: No; I mean, at least not amongst folks (ph) my age, really.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. I wonder why. People work more?
THERAPIST: Because you don't make as much money doing this relative to the cost of living as you did 20, 30 years ago.
CLIENT: Yeah. Did you have a lot of student loans?
THERAPIST: Like that, I'm not so much going to go into. [00:05:02]
CLIENT: Okay. I went to the 7:00 a.m. sitting today. I would like to be able to do that every day.
CLIENT: I imagine it's really different meditating around other people who are meditating from meditating by yourself. [00:06:02] Well, I guess I know it's different.
CLIENT: It's not a lot of people who come to the daily sittings; it's a handful, two or three or four or five.
CLIENT: Your emergency text or your emergency message is still bothering me so much. I'm sorry...because I would really like to leave it alone.
CLIENT: And here's a case where managing this relationship means a different action than...using this relationship as a means...to my own "whatever," understanding of myself. Does that (inaudible at 00:08:58)?
CLIENT: Normally, with other people, I would not say anything and wait for it to come up again...and be very patient. But it's on my mind, so I say it here. [00:10:00] But it's not lost on you that I'm saying it and that I'm-actually want to know about it, right? You can't help but treat it as...well, ","P1-N4006B1":"I'm not going to tell you what you can't help.
THERAPIST: [Laughs]
CLIENT: It's very frustrating.
THERAPIST: What? I mean.
CLIENT: It's frustrating that...
CLIENT: ...that it's the sort of strange thing and it feels exclusive. And I can't just put it away. [00:11:00] And I don't have to talk about it here, but...it's probably good to talk about it because it's upsetting to me. But then I've gone and talked about it and haven't given you your space or been ","P1-N400771":"patient. And it feels like I haven't let it arise naturally.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess talking about it...makes you feel like it turns you a little bit into someone you don't want to be. [00:12:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Who...I think...sort of needy and pushy and..."incompetent" isn't quite right, but...too much so those things to [give me] (ph) the kind of space you have an idea I should have.
CLIENT: Or that feels natural for me to give to anyone else; whether you need it or not. If I wanted somebody to tell me about something, I wouldn't have talked about it like this. [00:13:00] So I guess it feels bad because this isn't my normal strategy.
THERAPIST: I think that by (inaudible at 00:13:51) off of it a little bit in that I don't think it's that it's not your normal strategy, per se, that makes you feel crummy (ph) as much as what you feel this not-normal strategy involves or how it reflects on you; (inaudible at 00:14:14) in making you ","P1-N400851":"feel needy, dependent, and pushy.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm (ph).
CLIENT: At least, yeah, not about that. [00:15:01]
CLIENT: And I don't (inaudible at 00:16:04) about it anymore.
THERAPIST: I think...there may also be an added edge to it...today, because...of...my being out the rest of the week. [00:17:11]
CLIENT: Maybe; not that I'm aware of.
THERAPIST: I guess my thought was that...
THERAPIST: ...well, I did have some more thoughts about it, but I'm also thinking that you've just said you don't really want to talk about it anymore.
CLIENT: We can talk about it more.
THERAPIST: Well, I think you want to feel like it's going to feel okay (ph) to talk about it more. I mentioned it was actually really not easy to say, "I don't want to talk about this anymore."
CLIENT: That wasn't easy.
THERAPIST: In the same way that you want to feel good about my going away. And in a way, I think you do; [or maybe] (ph) that's part of what you feel.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But I...don't think that's the whole of it and I think you don't feel very good about feeling the other part of it, as well.
CLIENT: Well, I don't really feel good about your going away every session. [00:20:00] So this is sort of...like an extension of that. It's like, "Okay. [Time is back up] (ph)," certain feeling that I have about it.
CLIENT: Yeah, so that...I go and I [couldn't do it differently] (ph) or something.
CLIENT: It's hard because there's not...explicit anxiety about it. [00:22:04] But...it's very prickly, your leaving. And it...has a lot of different parts to it. And I'm always (ph) pretty ambivalent about it...but I can't-I don't feel like there's [a large] (ph) space for those things when we're actually ","P1-N400C31":"apart, so...
CLIENT: ...so they don't get a lot of attention.
CLIENT: Sort of like having a school photo of David Novak (sp?) in fourth grade. And having all sorts of secret coping behaviors around the photo, like saying "goodnight" to him; like kissing the photo occasionally.
CLIENT: I don't know what else to say [about it] (ph), but it feels like it's like that. [00:25:00] So it's like David Novak's going away for several days. It just amplifies what's already so [hard and bad] (ph).
CLIENT: It doesn't mean a whole (inaudible at 00:25:48) about the behaviors or anything. [00:26:00]
CLIENT: And the longer I'm away from you, the more...the more ways I find to cope; so it...actually, a long time feels...it actually goes (ph) easier, in some ways. It's kind of like if I were...it's like a short version of (inaudible at 00:27:06) dating again.
THERAPIST: It makes a lot of sense to me, actually. I think there's [parts of it] (ph) that really don't [reckon time] (ph) very well at all, and...it's certainly (ph) to go an hour, 24 hours, 96 hours...feeling or (ph) knowing you're never going to see anybody again, even if...another (inaudible at 00:28:21).
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: On Thursday...it was a big upheaval for me; the things that happened in our session, and then I watched this movie..."The Kids Are All Right." [00:29:09] Do you know about it? Did you watch any movie?
THERAPIST: [Laughs]
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Not very many, (inaudible at 00:29:19).
CLIENT: I don't watch any movies. And I think I remember why, after seeing this movie. Have you seen "Mary Poppins" yet?
THERAPIST: Maybe bits and pieces of it. [Laughs] Yeah.
CLIENT: So "The Kids Are All Right" and our session and whatever my state of mind was, which was so...ripe for poking...and my heart...yeah, it sort of just caused this huge explosion for me. [00:30:10]
THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. I'm remembering the trailer. It stars Annette Jeremyning and somebody else.
CLIENT: I don't know names of actors.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay; all right. Sorry, go ahead yeah, it's a lesbian couple in California.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:30:30) but sure. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:36:17); and...but I'm noticing all of these things about these American families; about their way of saying goodbye and how their children are so aware of their parents' faults. And...whatever we talked about on Thursday made...made me feel pretty alienated from my parents. [00:37:00]
CLIENT: Jeremy didn't really know what to do with me because it didn't-it doesn't make a whole lot of sense without his knowing what we talked about in here, (inaudible at 00:38:41). So when I was saying, "I'm afraid I'm going to have an affair, I'm afraid I'm going to have an affair," it was not...it ","P1-N401191":"sort of just added to the being upset. [00:39:03]
CLIENT: I feel pressure to hold it together because I have to go soon; or you're going to ask me to go soon. [00:42:00]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, yeah. (inaudible at 00:42:02)
CLIENT: Well, it feels like I did (inaudible at 00:42:04), [I guess] (ph). [Therapy immersion] (ph). What?
THERAPIST: [Is that how] (ph) you feel?
CLIENT: [None of that feels when I feel I did] (ph) to say it.
THERAPIST: You also want the time to fall apart.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Do you still love each other in the end of the day (ph)? (inaudible at 00:43:53)
THERAPIST: Yeah, my impression is that...somehow...the actions and the kid leaving for college and the rest is...
THERAPIST: ...a dramatic distraction. [00:44:27]
CLIENT: You don't think the affair-do you think the affair is a dramatic distraction?
THERAPIST: And when they wind up together, it's going to make things tense; it exposes a problem that is already there in their relationship, but the one who's too uptight and the one who's more easy-going and he's... (inaudible at 00:44:55) [their lives is] (ph)...symbolic, in some way, but he's not ","P1-N401431":"something (inaudible at 00:45:02) long-term relationship with and they're losing their kid. Forever (inaudible at 00:45:13).
CLIENT: The college didn't take up five minutes; (inaudible at 00:45:24) for five minutes.
THERAPIST: I could well be wrong about the movie, (inaudible at 00:45:36).
CLIENT: I think you're right. It's referred to throughout the movie as sort of this-she's (inaudible at 00:45:49) the center of the movie, in some ways. But it's her mom who sleeps with the guy who takes the spotlight of the drama. [00:46:03]
THERAPIST: I mean, if I really was going to go on in the movie, I would say that the two women are two parts of you, who-the one part that's...if I'm the guy on the motorcycle, there's the one part that feels anxious and uptight and kind of clingy and can't deal with the other part that's easy-going, ","P1-N4014D1":"that's off having an affair with me. [00:47:02]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: With Jeremy, with your parents.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: We should stop (inaudible at 00:47:45).
CLIENT: Bye, Josh.
THERAPIST: Take care, (inaudible at 00:48:15).
CLIENT: Okay.
