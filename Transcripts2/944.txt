TITLE: Client "Ma", Session August 06, 2013: Client discusses the possibility of joining a choir and her memories of past choirs she has been a part of.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the possibility of joining a choir and her memories of past choirs she has been a part of.
CLIENT: I'm also not feeling great so if I have to go out...
THERAPIST: Yeah. What's wrong?
CLIENT: Oh, I ate something wrong. I'm not going into work today actually. But yeah...
THERAPIST: I hope you feel better.
CLIENT: Yeah. Thanks. (PAUSE) I'm thinking about joining a choir. I can't tell if that's a really good idea or a really terrible idea.
THERAPIST: Oh?
CLIENT: Good in the sense that I really love choral music and I really love singing. Bad in the sense that like (PAUSE) pretty much every choir I've ever joined, I've left in disgust, often after years. But... [00:01:01]
THERAPIST: He kept ignoring you?
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) So, you know, I... It was like the year before he was retiring anyway. So I told the dean and she was like, "Hmm... That's pretty unacceptable." And I was like, "Yeah, I know." [00:07:01]
THERAPIST: Is that what they fired her for?
CLIENT: No, no. That's like... That was normal.
THERAPIST: Oh okay. Yeah.
CLIENT: No. I think they ended up firing her because she like... (SIGH) She stopped... She stopped doing any paperwork at all, like any grading, anything. She had her son who was... I think he was like 22, 23 but didn't have a college degree come in and teach her classes because she, you know, was behind ","P1-N400371":"on grading so she had this idea that she would grade the papers and he would teach.
THERAPIST: I see. [00:09:15]
CLIENT: And she lost it and screamed at a couple of students. (inaudible at 00:09:27) And like... (PAUSE) There was someone who had to retire early. It was sort of like so clear to me that that was a very real scenario and also like I was the person coming in and I didn't want to like poke about it. ","P1-N4003B1":"But, you know, it's a school. There's a lot of gossip.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So I had a really good relationship with them and I sort of was expecting that... I just wasn't, was not expecting to be treated like a child anymore. (PAUSE) You know, I was really sort of starting to develop some good friendships there and stuff. But I had sort of decided that people weren't ","P1-N400491":"going to get to treat me like that anymore. [00:14:07]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I guess I also see it as being like extremely perfectionistic in the way that, you know, you have to be in the choir. Like, to some extent, like a choir is successful insofar as every single member of it is as perfectionistic as the choir director. Like, you know, you do it again and again and ","P1-N400511":"again and again and it's very rare that after I've finished singing a piece I feel like, "Yeah, we did that right." [00:16:11]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:17:45)
CLIENT: Mr. Ferguson who was the choir director at my high school he was one of those people who like is fairly despicable but has convinced himself and everyone around him that he's eccentric and cute. (PAUSE) And... (SIGH) (PAUSE) Yeah. He just loved me for two years.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I was definitely the best singer I have ever been and probably will ever be with him. (PAUSE) Eh.
THERAPIST: What?
CLIENT: I just said eh. Just... (PAUSE) I don't know. It doesn't seem... It doesn't seem like it.
THERAPIST: I guess it also seems to me that what you're talking about with the choir directors is unusual in that... (PAUSE) I don't know. (PAUSE) I guess a couple of things. First, it kind of involves the moment when the other person really loses their patience. You're worrying about it, anticipating ","P1-N400771":"this (inaudible at 00:26:11) is worth it in light of that. [00:26:17]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I guess the piece about what you have been telling yourself about (PAUSE) like what's beautiful about the singing kind of justifying some sort of treatment...
CLIENT: In some ways I feel like I might still be putting up with it if I hadn't come to the conclusion that losing one's temper is actually a lot less effective for getting what you want than other management techniques. (LAUGHTER) I don't know. [00:27:59]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:28:21) when you describe them of (PAUSE) (inaudible) choir directors are like acting in a pretty narcissistic way.
CLIENT: Well, that comes with the territory. I mean... (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) You know...
THERAPIST: I think you may feel as though I've just sort of doubted you or pushed back in some way on what you were saying.
CLIENT: I don't know. (PAUSE) I'm not sure why I felt like I needed to defend my narcissism with ambition. But like... I don't know. It doesn't bother me as long as they don't take it out on me. But they usually do.
THERAPIST: So (inaudible) choirs and about choir directors that you were like (PAUSE) among other things, sort of trying out in part your relationship to me being critical and frustrated. You know, sad too but critical and frustrated about the way that you've been treated. And it's kind of taking up ","P1-N4009F1":"some space. And it felt like, you know, what I said maybe sounded (inaudible) on the defensive. And, you know, I'm not... [00:35:07]
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:35:21) I didn't feel particularly defensive but then like I look at what I said and then, oh yeah, that makes sense. Like I don't...
THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, let's see. So (PAUSE) the last thing that I said was about your description of the choir directors making them sound narcissistic.
CLIENT: I don't know.
THERAPIST: It felt like there was an implication that, you know, maybe there's something here going on about you if you're describing all these people in that way.
CLIENT: Huh. Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I don't know.
THERAPIST: Right. I know... I guess I should say I know what you mean by that.
CLIENT: I felt like that's absolutely true but not quite the problem. I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. But...
THERAPIST: I see. So maybe it's the case where I seemed ignorant in a way. Like...
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess so.
THERAPIST: I see. So it sounds like you're describing all these physicists as being kind of nerdy. You know? Like...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:37:59)
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:38:01]
THERAPIST: And you're like, "Duh." (PAUSE) But then my reaction is probably what made you feel nervous. I mean, I got the impression that maybe I made you feel a bit nervous. I don't know if it's me really not knowing that much about choir directors or something.
CLIENT: I don't know. Maybe it felt like I... (PAUSE) That kind of like... That kind of narcissism which I see is pretty defensive is something that I like really, really see in myself and I have a real problem with it. So maybe it's like hitting too close to a bone or something.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I'm still wondering if I sounded like a big idiot about choir directors (inaudible at 00:40:01) (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: Okay. (LAUGHTER) (inaudible) (PAUSE) Yeah. I'm not sure if it's all musicians. But... (PAUSE) It's most of the singers I know.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: There's also such an overlap in terms of people I know and have met between like music people and theater people. (PAUSE) Yeah. (PAUSE) Which is another thing that like I left basically because I was disappointed with... (PAUSE) I was disappointed with people in charge and (inaudible) less than ","P1-N400DF1":"I expected to. It was like all I did in high school, not all I did but like I was going to be an actor and like that was what I was going to do. So... [00:44:15]
THERAPIST: It's time to go.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: See you on Monday.
CLIENT: Have a good weekend.
THERAPIST: Thanks. You too.
