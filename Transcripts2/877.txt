TITLE: Client "R", Session January 03, 2014: Client discusses the fear of being abandoned by their therapist, and possible inappropriate feelings for them.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the fear of being abandoned by their therapist, and possible inappropriate feelings for them.
CLIENT: I felt some degree of rest last night, in contrast to restlessness.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: It was really good. (pause) Sometimes it feels like Thursdays are the only useful sessions. I’m beginning to see why. (pause) I know I feel crunched and I’m a lot less sad to leave on Thursdays. [00:01:58] (pause) I think whatever openings happen feel more organic and slower and ","P1-N400111":"better; and there is more space and time to take risks. I think it’s in the spirit of this to wonder when this pain is going to pass (pause) or to ask you about it. [00:03:21]
THERAPIST: Does it really matter to you?
CLIENT: Because it really matters to me?
THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess I imagined you thought it wasn’t because you anticipated I wouldn’t answer the question or wouldn’t answer the question maybe because I know, for whatever reason, that that’s why it seems like it’s not in the spirit of this. [00:04:14] (pause)
CLIENT: Yeah, maybe. (pause) I think it’s also because [nature growth] (ph?) here is so hard to predict and intermittent and spontaneous; (pause) and it’s hard to measure anything. [00:05:31] Beginnings are blurred and endings are probably blurred, too, so it’s like it’s more ","P1-N400191":"in the spirit of things to just wait and see, except that it’s really fucking painful.
THERAPIST: In my mind, all that reality stuff, it doesn’t matter at all.
CLIENT: Yeah, it gets really old.
THERAPIST: And what matters is that it’s painful and you want to know. From another angle, I understand reality patters but . . . [00:06:16]
CLIENT: Do you think this is what I will mainly work through, too? (pause)
THERAPIST: I don’t know.
CLIENT: I have a fear that (pause) you will say that you’re done with me before I’m ready. [00:07:18] Or you will say that I’m done with you before I’m ready. (long pause) [00:09:14] It’s very scary to me, even though it’s not how things have happened in my life. ","P1-N400251":"It’s like the idea is much more scary than just staying in reality.
THERAPIST: I think that’s happened to you plenty of times.
CLIENT: It’s happened here once. (pause) [00:10:02] Oh – I have to leave before I’m ready. I have to leave people before I’m ready.
THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:10:17) without acknowledging that’s what’s going on.
CLIENT: It’s the same way as the no-fault thing. Somebody has actually abandoned me or it feels really bad to think of it that way or it feels wrong or scary. Maybe it’s about power, like I’m powerless to think that it’s happening. [00:11:06] Nobody has really abandoned me. People ","P1-N4002D1":"get really abandoned in their life and that’s a really different feeling. I lived with orphans in Italy who were actually abandoned. (pause) It’s different, but how can I know? [00:12:08] It seems different. It felt like I was pulling that Italian orphan card recently. (both laugh) Wait ","P1-N4002D2":"a minute – let me tell you about abandonment, Jay. You have no idea. I know. When really, it occurred to me that I . . . [00:13:10]
THERAPIST: I forget who it was, but somebody brought up powerlessness recently and I guess the way that you just did it, again, flips it around more in terms of who knows what exactly and who is in control, because that seems so far apart, too. (pause) [00:13:58]
CLIENT: Like suddenly if I start talking about Italian orphans, I start to feel more in control.
THERAPIST: I get a sense that suggests I know what abandonment looks like. I’ve worked with very vulnerable kids to whom that could happen; and I know that that is not what happened to me. I guess I sort of heard an implication, although it is possible I read into this, something like I know and ","P1-N400331":"you, Jay, don’t know in the same way.
CLIENT: Yeah, of course you know. (pause) [00:15:03] Maybe not in the exact same way.
THERAPIST: I’m referring to the fantasy you seem to be in at that moment, which you don’t seem to be in any more.
CLIENT: [You do not give me what I want.] (ph?) It makes me think that this teaching will evolve while jabbering away. I think about that a lot when I get into an area of pain, which helps me step away from that. [00:16:07] (pause) There is a real instinct to wonder about the mismatch of conditions ","P1-N400391":"in my life and my strong emotions, like the conditions don’t seem to support how strongly I feel or give reasons for it. [00:17:05] (pause) I think that is a source of a lot of pain, anxiety and confusion. (pause) [00:18:08]
THERAPIST: And I think you imagine an interest in those feelings in me that you then work a little bit to disqualify, like existed with the . . . (pause) [00:19:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I feel like can’t you see that it’s me who is responding in the wrong way to all of these apparent events? It’s not what the other person did. (pause) That’s how I feel. I don’t see how that makes things really hard for me, but it’s how I feel ","P1-N4003D1":"about it. [00:20:07]
THERAPIST: That’s your conviction – that your feelings are out of whack to what really happened?
CLIENT: Yes. (pause) It’s like moms have to go to work. That’s a reasonable thing. It’s unreasonable to cry about it for so long.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And people have to leave their family vacations and their families, and that reasonable. [00:21:01] It’s unreasonable to cry about it for so long. If you don’t want to pay out of pocket for therapy, it’s reasonable to find somebody else so you don’t have to pay out of ","P1-N400451":"pocket. It’s unreasonable to cry about that for so long. Or like (pause) . . . the last one doesn’t actually feel reasonable to me – the last one being we’re in a specific relationship and we’re not in any other relationship. [00:22:23] And why that’s true, I don’t ","P1-N400452":"really know why. It’s just the way it happened; like why we didn’t find each other much earlier. Sometimes it feels like well, this is a reasonable way to be with somebody that, most of the time, actually it feels like it’s completely wrong, (pause) a completely inappropriate way to ","P1-N400453":"be with you, for whom I feel so much. But then it’s like sometimes it feels like it works because this can be really intense and intimate and maybe allows for more of that than a more conventional relationship that I have in mind. It gets really confusing. [00:24:12] (pause) I got very anxious ","P1-N400454":"about it. (pause)
THERAPIST: I imagine that it’s like the roles from a few minutes ago are reversed and maybe I’m going to tell you what the realities are and what makes sense and why you’re confused about that or it feels totally different from that to you. [00:25:20] That’s not right. [ ] (inaudible ","P1-N400471":"at 00:25:24)
CLIENT: Or like simply that you might say that you don’t feel the same way. (pause) [00:26:03] It’s one thing to be afraid of you saying, “This isn’t supposed to happen” or “Sally, nobody else feels this way.” It’s like, well, it’s another thing. ","P1-N400491":"I think it’s much more scary for you to say, “You’re on your own in here.”
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Like that’s what makes me feel very unreasonable, kind of, like my feelings are wrong or bad.
THERAPIST: I see. (long pause) [00:28:43] From what I can tell, you are very fond of me. (pause) [But it doesn’t stick] (ph?) like this other disqualifying feeling, Jay, like somehow it takes up a lot more room. [00:29:50] My time [ ] (inaudible at 00:29:51) [my feelings are unqualified.] (ph?) ","P1-N4004F1":"(long pause) [00:30:47] I feel like I’m waiting for you to confirm that you are very fond of me or like it was very risky to say it or something. (long pause) [00:33:33] I think when you feel dependent; actually, like I have done something in the moment to abandon you, you kind of find me and ","P1-N4004F2":"bring me back. [00:33:59] I guess what I was smiling about was the ways I could imagine you doing that, like clearing your throat or “now over to you.”
CLIENT: Yeah. [ ] (inaudible at 00:34:14) to those things.
THERAPIST: But I guess I think the more serious point is that it becomes very difficult to sit with or to contain the worry and upset in that moment where it feels like I have left you by not responding when you have really put yourself out there and you show it to me. [00:35:22]
CLIENT: It’s very, very, very hard to contain. It brings up [feelings of how I feel and think, but I doubt in everything.] (ph?) [00:36:16] Like nothing is good. No [ ] is good. Nothing good is ever going to happen. (pause) [Sometimes I feel] (ph?) very foreign to me.
THERAPIST: It’s sort of like I stabbed you in the heart.
CLIENT: Again, the agency isn’t quite there.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:37:12] I had a stake in my heart and I don’t know who put it there or how it got there. Certainly you could take it out; and you’re not.
THERAPIST: I guess that’s what’s clear.
CLIENT: Those are feelings and the thoughts are equally foreign, like oh, Jay probably hates me. He probably completely hates me; and that’s really foreign. I don’t ever perseverate on that or think that it’s true or suffer from that kind of thinking, but here it is. [00:38:09] And ","P1-N400611":"it’s hard to know how to hold on then. (long pause) [00:39:03]
CLIENT: I think clearing my throat or getting something like that, to me it dissipates how bad it felt. It really feels like that was for another time and now I feel okay just looking at you and waiting, which is kind of [ ] (inaudible at 00:39:32). (pause)
THERAPIST: Another five minutes. (long pause) [00:40:58]
CLIENT: How come you can’t just tell me? (pause) [00:41:57]
THERAPIST: Do you actually not know why? I won’t say that I can’t, but that I don’t.
CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:42:17)
THERAPIST: The short answer is because, at the end of the day, I think it’s more helpful.
CLIENT: It’s satisfying to me that that caused you to fret a little bit. (pause) [00:43:06]
THERAPIST: (chuckles) (pause) [00:43:35]
CLIENT: Well then I’m not helping you [ ] (inaudible at 00:43:37). (whispered) I tell you so much. If it’s not helpful to me for you to tell me, why is it helpful to you for me to tell you? I suppose it’s very hard to be here, for only the sake of helping myself. (pause) [00:44:44] ","P1-N400731":"Or maybe it is helpful for you, just not in the same way. Is that what you’re saying? [00:45:04]
THERAPIST: I don’t think that [ ] (inaudible at 00:45:05). (pause) We should finish up now. (pause) [00:45:55]
CLIENT: I like to make [ ] (inaudible at 00:45:57) and all the other future flowers that might not look good when they’re dried.
