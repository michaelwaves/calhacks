TITLE: Client "Ma", Session August 05, 2013: Client discusses some childhood memories and how she feels the need to act a certain way so people don't think she's close to suicide again.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses some childhood memories and how she feels the need to act a certain way so people don't think she's close to suicide again.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:00:07)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: The (inaudible at 00:00:11) Yeah. It actually was standing up and then it toppled and spilled the water all over the place. (inaudible)
CLIENT: Alright. I love sunflowers.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: We used to grow them. I worked at an organic vegetable farm for a couple of summers in college, like the year after I got out of high school and then right when I went to college (inaudible at 00:00:49) That was a crazy job. [00:00:57]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And then like... (PAUSE) But the people who worked there were kind of a combination of like friends of Carla's (ph) kids, Carla being the second in command, so like people who went to this like fancy private school with me and then like very, very poor families from the area and like a lot of ","P1-N400231":"like Mexican immigrants. [00:03:07]
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: (inaudible) She's very cute. (PAUSE) It's really great when other people have dogs. (LAUGHTER) Or puppies specifically. [00:07:05]
THERAPIST: Do you know the name of the town? (inaudible at 00:07:51)
CLIENT: I don't remember. Right next to... Is it Mount (ph)?
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:07:59]
CLIENT: Like they can...
THERAPIST: Past (inaudible)
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. They can like see the mountain from their backyard.
THERAPIST: Yeah. That's a lot further out.
CLIENT: Yeah. It was nice. I have this... It's surprising to me how quickly the city (inaudible) because I just feel like I never do.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But, yeah. (PAUSE) They're very, very proud of their house. They're like... The husband works for a company and the wife works with, works at like an assisted care facility with Alzheimer's patients and, you know, they're just like a real nice little couple and just really excited to like have ","P1-N4004D1":"bought a house and like showed us all that they're doing with the back yard and they're like trying to make the grass grow which is really not at all... (LAUGHTER) [00:09:03]
THERAPIST: Oh wow. [00:09:55]
CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) So... Yeah. (PAUSE) And then talking about some other friends of ours who are from the same program and who also live in the Denver area...
THERAPIST: These are people from the manor (ph)?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: I think this other couple, Stephen (ph) and Jenna (ph), I think Stephen... (SIGH) I think he's a post-doc at Harvard but I'm not sure. But they are like... The house is like a wreck every time. They have two kids under the age of two so like they're that also. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) You get a new appreciation for...
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Yes. But like even before they had a kid, there's just like dog fur everywhere, the house is a wreck, like... But also like they're like two hours late for everything. [00:11:11]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:11:15)
CLIENT: So we were talking about it and it clearly bothers Henry and Mason (ph). But Mason was like, "You know, I think that's just how Jenna grew up." And I was like, "Well, it makes sense because like that's how I grew up. So their house doesn't look messy to me at all." Or like I sort of notice it ","P1-N400651":"because most people's houses are like that now but like when my apartment gets there, I don't notice it. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: I had to have like a last minute cleaning spree before James (ph) got home to be like... You know, I don't want him to be afraid to leave me alone which, if he saw what I did to the apartment... (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: He would be. [00:12:01]
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, he already is afraid to leave me alone. But, you know... I feel like the trail of dishes would not help. (PAUSE) Yeah. He is really afraid. I don't... (SIGH) And, you know, considering I spent like two weeks a week ago talking to you about how I want to kill myself, I don't really ","P1-N4006D1":"know what to say to make him not be afraid anymore. I don't... (PAUSE) Yeah.
THERAPIST: I see. [00:13:57]
CLIENT: ...out of proportion. And it sort of throws me off and then I get mad at him and then we talk about it and it's like, "Oh no. You're just really scared." You know, because everything I say that's not complete contentment could be the next crisis is coming.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And, you know, most of the things I say that are complete contentment could also be the next crisis is coming. He doesn't know. You know, I don't know either so I'm not helping with that. I feel like I'm sort of starting to get to the point where I'm not hunkered down panicking about it...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...and... But that's not like a rational thing. That's just a learning to live with it. [00:15:05]
CLIENT: We used to go through vacuum cleaners with like one every six months or so because there's just dog hair everywhere. Like I don't...
THERAPIST: You mean growing up or... [00:16:01]
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I have no idea how that happened. I don't know what most people with dogs do. Presumably most people with dogs don't have their vacuum cleaner break every time they use it. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But it doesn't seem clear to me. We'd have like... They'd have (inaudible at 00:16:25) dinners at our house once a month and so that was like when things had to be cleaned up because people were coming over. You know, sometimes it was more success than others. (PAUSE) At one point, I remember ","P1-N400891":"one of the, one of the members of the vestry... Because it would be potluck. So my dad would have like some entree. It was usually salmon because he knows how to cook salmon really, really well. [00:16:59]
THERAPIST: Right. Nobody's happy.
CLIENT: No. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: I totally wasn't allowed to. It wasn't... People weren't okay with it but, you know, I was always by myself a good portion of the time so I would do that because there weren't like sidewalks anywhere.
THERAPIST: I see. This was like... You were how old?
CLIENT: Like eight to eleven sort of age. You know, I (inaudible at 00:19:43) always. (LAUGHTER) Yeah.
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) [00:21:09]
CLIENT: So he served it and he just put a lemon in the middle. (LAUGHTER) And like, yeah... (PAUSE) We also inevitably had, when Amanda (ph) and I were home alone, had run out of dishwashing detergent and decided to put like dishwashing liquid in instead of see whether that would work. I don't know ","P1-N400A51":"if you've ever done this but...
THERAPIST: Oh you mean the stuff that you wash dishes with (inaudible)
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know if you've ever done that. But it's hilarious. (LAUGHTER) There's like four inches of bubbles on the kitchen floor like everywhere. Like it just doesn't stop.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:22:05]
CLIENT: Yeah. I think we got it mostly cleaned up before anybody got home. (PAUSE) But then we knew not to do it.
THERAPIST: I... (PAUSE) Something about it seems (PAUSE) can be hard for you to sort of know what you're, what sort of perspective you have on things that happened growing up...
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:23:11]
THERAPIST: ...and that maybe, I think you may feel like a bit of a wish for me to let you know (inaudible at 00:23:19) I have (inaudible) or whatever.
CLIENT: No I think that's right.
THERAPIST: But I think you're using this saying that also like (inaudible at 00:23:39) what do I make of that?
CLIENT: Yeah. It feels like... It feels like maybe it was strange but I also don't have... I don't have any other early picture of like anything else. [00:24:03]
THERAPIST: Yeah there are sort of two things you said that kind of stuck with me. One, you grew up in the house by yourself in the skates with the book.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Yes. That was like most summer afternoons as far as like... Like that was one of my favorite things to do.
THERAPIST: Uh huh. (PAUSE) I guess what I was thinking of (inaudible at 00:24:51) I wondered if that's what it feels like talking about stuff in the past is kind of (inaudible)
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) [00:25:01]
THERAPIST: Just kind of like, you know, by yourself in the house, kind of, a way to keep yourself occupied and unsure what to think of it. And it also seems to be something that's a bit disturbing in learning that Henry has nothing on the walls or the counters because his mother is a hoarder. I'm not ","P1-N400C71":"quite sure what it was, probably that she was a hoarder but also that probably pretty disturbing about the way they have nothing.
CLIENT: It's like... It's a... You know, the house is built like for them. They're the first owners. And I sort of think it's horrible. It's just the opposite of where I would want to live. It just... If feels just bleak to me going inside. [00:26:11]
THERAPIST: How so? [00:26:55]
CLIENT: Oh, just that moment of realizing that my values are not absolute values.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: You know, it kind of made me feel like a little bit of a snob which I am a little bit of a snob but I don't always like to think that way. (PAUSE) But then also like, yeah, a little sad that like, you know, maybe Mason does want to put pictures up and Henry doesn't. I don't know. It doesn't ","P1-N400D31":"seem like it. But... (PAUSE) I guess it's sort of like... It feels like it kind of got driven to that point. [00:28:03]
THERAPIST: Like they were held captive.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (PAUSE) But like (PAUSE) you know, maybe that looks like what they've been looking for. I don't know.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:32:45) I wonder if there are times where you feel like a show house.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: When, in fact, you are cluttered with all this bad stuff that doesn't feel like...
CLIENT: It's all in the closet. (PAUSE) It's getting tough to... (PAUSE) It's getting to where I feel like I have to manage James's fear by acting like I am, you know, collected in some way. [00:35:11]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:43:47)
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) I feel like I don't talk about it with you that often and I think part of it is that I'm ashamed to talk about it and part of it is that I can't see it because it's all around. [00:44:07]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You don't see it after a while. You just stop seeing it.
THERAPIST: Right. (PAUSE) We should stop.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: See you tomorrow.
