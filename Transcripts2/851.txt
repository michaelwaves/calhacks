DESCRIPTION: Client discusses frustration, anger, and resentment at having to pretend that she does not harbor feelings of anger and resentment towards family members and friends.
CLIENT: I�m really sick of this weather, as I�m sure the rest of the world probably is. I regretted not taking my car today. �Cause it was so cold and windy and gray. And then I was thinking, you know, I feel the exact way I did last year, just what�s the point of being here? ","P1-N4000B1":"It�s miserable, the weather�s miserable and I don�t like, nothing�s different. And then, so it�s like, is it seasonal? �Cause I didn�t feel that way in necessarily in the summer. Or, I don�t know. But there�s so much more bad weather than ","P1-N4000B2":"good weather, that like, is it even worth it to be here at all. I�m just really sick of seeing gross snow and it�s wet everywhere and cold. I�m permanently cold. And I feel like February is not moving fast enough and, you know, whatever. I�m just kind of tired [1:34]. (pause)
THERAPIST: For getting up in the morning.
CLIENT: Yeah. Please. He�s getting a pat on the back for doing what I�ve been doing for the past ten or more years without prompting or help or � well, no. I had help, but without like, needing somebody to hold my hand through it or having somebody to drag me all around to all the ","P1-N400171":"apartments viewings or interviews or help me with all the applications and my resume. Oh, so I went to pick up laundry at my mother�s house. I guess it was Monday or Tuesday, and I was saying how I went out to dinner with the girls, and it was fun and like, whatever. [9:06] Yeah, I guess this ","P1-N400172":"was Monday morning. Did I already tell you this? That she said, and I was saying oh, it�s so nice and that they paid for me for my dinner for me for my birthday and da, da, da.
THERAPIST: [13:02] I mean, in a way it sounds like it�s up to you to � I guess it�s different from the well, Trina, talk to your therapist about it. I mean, there it seems like, at least for you, she doesn�t want to deal with or can�t handle something your being angry ","P1-N4001D1":"with her or reactive or something like that. It sounds different, I mean, from what your describing about how it feels to you, she�s sort of raining on your parade, but also spoiling a moment between the two of you where you�re excited to tell her about something good you had which was ","P1-N4001D2":"friends who took you out.[14:15]
CLIENT: Yeah. And then she didn�t understand why I got so upset. She didn�t understand and then it was my fault because I was just being reactive as usual, and she was just the innocent. What did I say?
THERAPIST: Like it circled back to that anger thing.
CLIENT: Well, I can�t say anything. Well, if I do say anything. And we�ve had this discussion before where I�m like, I don�t understand why you can�t just think a little bit more before you talk, when you know it�s a sensitive subject, or you know how I react ","P1-N400231":"or whatever. Not to say that I shouldn�t work on being so reactive or like, my anger or temper or whatever, but I don�t think it�s fair to say that I�m the only one that should have to change my behavior in the situation. There�s two people, you know.[15:28] (pause) ","P1-N400232":"Like I said to her, I said, why can�t I just tell you about my night without it turning into a lesson or something? (pause) I�ve got something in my eye. Sorry.
THERAPIST: Do you need saline or something.
CLIENT: It�s like a � got it. [16:18] (pause) and work has been really exhausting this week, which is fine, but I just feel really tired I think from the whole week. And, I don�t feel � I�m just not � still not sure what to do to feel better about my life here. ","P1-N400271":"[17:24] (pause) and I just feel like a broken record. [18:33] (pause)
THERAPIST: I know you�re very unhappy. The weather sucks, your train was late, your friend�s being vindictive, your mom is being critical, dismissive to you while she�s sort of going nuts over your brother. And it�s feeling like same old, same old to you. [19:23]
CLIENT: Yeah. Basically.
THERAPIST: On that I�m not yet sure what to say.
CLIENT: Maybe it�s a lack of sun. I don�t know. Meanwhile, nobody from my dad�s side of the pond I�ve spoken to in over a week and my dad hasn�t called or whatever, but I haven�t called him. I�ve been busy, but I guess, whatever. [20:22] (pause)
THERAPIST: I think it�s pretty clear that you�re pretty miserable and stuck.
CLIENT: Right. I mean, I like, want to go see � I need to go see my grandma this weekend when I go, but I also am avoiding that, because it�s just kind of depressing, I guess. I don�t know. I don�t what to say to her. I don�t know how long to spend with her. I am kind ","P1-N400331":"of tired of going to do that visit alone. I mean, I�m just never there at the same time with my family, but (pause) It just kind of feels like my brother is off the hook.[22:03] I don�t know how he � I�m sure he doesn�t feel like, oh yay, I�m off the hook. I ","P1-N400332":"don�t have to see my grandmother. I don�t have to do whatever. But it makes me feel like I�m picking up a lot of slack like when I suggested that he come and help shovel my mom out and then she acted like that was the worst possible thing I could have suggested.
THERAPIST: You seem less so now as you�re starting to talk, but maybe also part of what was going on at the beginning of the hour, you seem to feel a little bit shut down. [24:05] And I imagine there�s a piece of that, that�s like, I think really you�re pretty upset and I ","P1-N400371":"imagine pretty worked up about some of this stuff. But I think you�re also worried, I could imagine you might be, about talking about it with me, because like what everybody else is doing when you try to do something for you or be there for you or be there for you or take care of you. I mean, ","P1-N400372":"I�m not saying overall it�s going horribly, but not in what you�re describing.
CLIENT: No. That�s right.
THERAPIST: [24:45] I don�t know if I�m going to like, put it back on you?
CLIENT: Maybe.
THERAPIST: Or it�s just going to go nowhere and feel pointless.
CLIENT: Right. It just feels like a broken record. (pause) And I still feel like I�m always having to pretend stuff. [25:42] Like, pretend at work. Pretend to Stephanie that I�m not feeling really regretful of even having told her because of the way she�s acting now. Pretend to ","P1-N400411":"my mom that I�m not spending money or something. I don�t know what I � Pretend that I�m okay being single. Pretend that, you know, whatever. It just is � (pause) and it�s because I feel like, really repetitive and really a sad story that I feel the same as I ","P1-N400412":"did last year and that I still am harboring so much anger and resentment towards by you. [26:55] (pause) Then I feel bad about that and feel like I have to count my blessings and whatever and put things in perspective because it�s not so bad. I have my health, I have this, I have that, and ","P1-N400413":"you know, whatever. But then why don�t I feel better or something. I don�t know. Like, that doesn�t make me feel better. It just makes me feel worse because I�m like the asshole. [27:43]
THERAPIST: Well, I think there�s a pretty good reason that it�s hard for you to sort of enjoy or feel better because of some of the good things you have, which is � I think you get worried about feeling close or feeling positive parts of relationships that you�re in, because ","P1-N400431":"I think you anticipate it will feel like a setup, or you�ll be caught off guard when you�re disappointed. [28:50] I agree it was a shitty comment for your mom to make. Absolutely. But I think what happens is that kind of smudges out some of the good things you otherwise feel between you. ","P1-N400432":"You know, like, I know you feel she still loves you.
CLIENT: Thank you.
