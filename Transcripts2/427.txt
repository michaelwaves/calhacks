TITLE: Client "K", Session January 30, 2014: Client discusses feeling overwhelmed dealing with others.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses feeling overwhelmed dealing with others.
THERAPIST: I know you’re out Monday and Tuesday this coming week. I was wondering about Monday and thereafter, whether you wanted that double [ph] your time.
CLIENT: Yeah, I can do that at 11:45.
THERAPIST: OK. It is, really, what is better for you; I don’t…
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, that works fine with me.
THERAPIST: That is better? OK.
THERAPIST: So I’ll start that on the – I guess that is the tenth?
CLIENT: Yep. [00:01:00]
CLIENT: Today, [pauses] I’m feeling, I guess, kind of like the same as I described Tuesday – just kind of [pauses] – I don’t know. [00:02:00]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And [pauses for 20 seconds] I guess there is – I don’t know – it is hard for me to be motivated, or I kind of complain about things. Recently, everything is kind of like – I don’t know – heavy or I’m dreading things, and… [00:05:06]
THERAPIST: Well, it makes me think of what we’ve been talking about. [00:06:00]
CLIENT: All right. [Pauses for 17 seconds]
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: …Frustrating. And I feel like… [00:08:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah, and [pauses] I guess, for my part, though, I think I also pointed out ways of how you’ve been doing things hasn’t been working, and some things that I think are scary and overwhelming. [Pauses] [00:10:00]
CLIENT: Right. [Pauses from 00:10:44 to 00:11:23] [00:11:00]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: …Things I want to change, or just kind of being tired of feeling stuck or – I don’t know. And it is not – it is kind of hard to just [pauses] – I’m not going to [inaudible at 00:12:01] anywhere or to just… [00:12:05]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [Clears throat]
THERAPIST: Well, actually, I think you are doing things a bit differently. I’m not quite sure of [pauses] the extent of it, out in your life, but certainly in the way that you’re talking to me… [00:14:05]
CLIENT: Right. [Pauses] All you’re I mean…
THERAPIST: I think it is part of my point is to respond to saying you feel so stuck and not trying to dispute that you feel stuck. I’m just saying there are ways, actually, you seem like you are [pauses] talking to this from a different way. [00:16:00]
CLIENT: All right. I guess I still feel like I’m…
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: …Missing something, or I need something to help me [pauses for ten seconds] – I don’t know – kind of better manage or…
CLIENT: I feel like I was – I don’t – I feel like I don’t – doing anything. I just feel like I’m just dreading everything. And I feel like I’m just not wanting to deal with anything. Or, I guess, instead of pushing myself or…
THERAPIST: [Clears throat] You’re feeling worse.
CLIENT: Right. [Pauses] Well, yeah, instead of being mad at myself for not doing it the way I want to and making myself anxious to do it. I just don’t want to deal with it. I don’t want to [pauses] think about it.
THERAPIST: With “it” being something on your to-do list?
CLIENT: I’m worried or [pauses]… [00:19:00]
THERAPIST: I could see you’re feeling like – very much subject to and overwhelmed by everything or lots of things, anyway, [pauses] like they are ruling how you feel.
CLIENT: Right. [00:20:00]
THERAPIST: And you can’t really do anything about it.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: So, [clears throat] [pauses for 11 seconds]…
CLIENT: [Pauses] Right.
THERAPIST: You just don’t feel like having anything to do with them, and it – and it sounds like – almost like a pit in your stomach over all of it.
CLIENT: Right. I just worry that – I don’t know – how am I – yeah, how am I going to do it, or why do I have to do this? [00:24:00]
THERAPIST: So, [pauses for 13 seconds] in a way, it sounds like there is kind of a domineering figure in there. You’re the one that is going to evaluate you on how you’re doing it, so there is a lot of pressure on you to do it very well; or [pauses] the one who made you do it in the – ","P1-N400951":"[coughs] who forced this on your in the first place… [00:25:05]
CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:25:25] Me [ph]?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Oh. I’ll dread it. While I’m making the plan or coming up with something, and she is going to be like, “This sucks.” And then, when I’m with her, the part that is weak or – it is just I feel like a parent and I’m not going to know what to do or what ","P1-N4009D1":"to – is that going to be enough or – answer her questions over [pauses]… [00:26:00]
THERAPIST: I can see how it feels much more kind of depressive and it feels anxious. [Pauses]
CLIENT: Right. [00:28:00]
CLIENT: I don’t know.
THERAPIST: [Clears throat]
CLIENT: I don’t know. I guess it is not nice [ph] so much. I just kind of want to not recover or [pauses] kind of… [00:30:02]
THERAPIST: Sorry. As I think about it, I think it is clear to me why this would kind of be a nightmare situation at work. [Pauses] You hate dealing with other people [chuckles] when you’re at work. Even if it is somebody – you go to get something for somebody, and they want to talk for half ","P1-N400B51":"an hour, or you go to lunch and kind of get absorbed by that for a while. You often really don’t like to do things that way; you like to stay focused on what you have to do, and that stuff kind of distracts you and throws you. And this woman is going to be in your face for two days. That sounds ","P1-N400B52":"totally not like your kind of [chuckles] thing. [Pauses for five seconds] I guess I’m just thinking, “Well, of course you’re dreading it.” [00:31:00]
THERAPIST: I would imagine it is going to be very hard to get anything else done [pauses] or to really have time to reorient on the things you need to do. [Pauses]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And that will also make the time when you’re not at work harder, knowing that [pauses for five seconds] – knowing that you have been kind of distracted and pulled off things you’d rather be doing, by all of this, and worrying about how you came across, and how the interactions ","P1-N400C11":"went, and about whatever else may come up.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I guess I say that partly because I imagine hovering over this, as well, for you although, we haven’t – neither of us – spoken to it today – is you’re feeling that it shouldn’t be this way, that it shouldn’t be an especially big deal with someone ","P1-N400CB1":"who is coming. You shouldn’t be dreading it so much, you should be able to roll it much more easily, work around it, all that stuff.
CLIENT: [Pauses] Right.
THERAPIST: And [pauses]… [00:34:00]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: …And maybe makes it hard to see that this is [pauses] kind of an exaggerated example. I don’t mean that you’re exaggerating [but] I mean the situation is an exaggeration of the kind of thing that, already, you find very annoying, [pauses] frustrating.
CLIENT: [Pauses] Right.
CLIENT: I’m just – I’m just thinking about how am I going to [pauses] stay on top of it.
THERAPIST: [Coughs] Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: So what do you think?
CLIENT: I don’t know. I was just – I think I will [ph] [inaudible at 00:37:46]…
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: I don’t know. [Pauses] I don’t know.
CLIENT: I don’t know. I just [taps surface] think I’ll just kind of [pauses for five seconds] – like, yesterday, I had to stay home [ph].
THERAPIST: Was there a moment you started feeling more upset?
CLIENT: [Pauses for eight seconds] I don’t know. I just kind of [pauses] thinking about it. I don’t know. I was just getting [ph] of not wanting to do anything. [00:39:03]
THERAPIST: I see.
THERAPIST: Like, earlier in the hour, when you first brought it up or more just now?
CLIENT: [Pauses] [Sighs] If – just now, I was kind of – I was thinking – I don’t know – even if we’re going to do preparations and – I don’t know – a lot of things I’d do – deal with before she comes, I guess.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: I see. So I guess my reconstruction goes something like this – tell me if this is right – like, what I said about, “Well, of course it is driving you nuts that she is coming” maybe helped you feel a little less bad (?) about having that reaction to her coming, so that, ","P1-N4010B1":"then, when you went to think of what you have to do, it just more felt sad and upsetting?
CLIENT: Right, or the part where you said [pauses] that I’m not able to kind of deal with it like – or I should have her meet [ph] [mumbles] [inaudible at 00:41:26].
THERAPIST: I’m sorry. I want to make sure I’m not missing something. [00:42:00]
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: OK.
CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:42:09] No.
CLIENT: No. [Pauses] It is just kind of a feeling of, “How am I going to do this?” and – I don’t know…
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: …It kind of leads to just not wanting to do it or kind of …
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. I see.
CLIENT: So, like – I think, yesterday – I don’t know – I just felt so [pauses] – like, tired and stuck, and I couldn’t even get out of – even to come in… [pauses] [00:44:03]
THERAPIST: Well, we should stop now. [Clears throat]
THERAPIST: I’ll see you tomorrow.
CLIENT: All right.
