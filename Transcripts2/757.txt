TITLE: Client "R", Session August 05, 2013: Client discusses her feelings about nature and farming. Client discusses a traumatic event that happened right before her wedding and how her husband feels about it.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses her feelings about nature and farming. Client discusses a traumatic event that happened right before her wedding and how her husband feels about it.
CLIENT: How are you?
THERAPIST: I'm doing okay.
CLIENT: Would you like a sunflower for your two-day week?
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:00:16) was a lot bigger.
THERAPIST: Whoa. Thank you.
CLIENT: I tried to get some of the (inaudible at 00:00:20).
THERAPIST: [Laughs]
CLIENT: [Laughs]
THERAPIST: Thanks! [Laughs]
CLIENT: They're really small. They're cute. I won't say (ph) any more.
THERAPIST: Okay. I'll put some water in there.
CLIENT: Okay.
CLIENT: Water might be important.
THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:01:02) maybe enough. (inaudible at 00:01:07)
THERAPIST: Thanks.
CLIENT: I gave one to Morris...on Saturday night, and he wrote me this (inaudible at 00:01:44). He wrote me this long, (inaudible) (ph) e-mail (inaudible at 00:01:51) about...much I've impacted this weekend. [00:02:00] I think he had been-I think he had drank something, the way that the e-mail sounded. ","P1-N400351":"But both of us are usually pretty dramatic with how touched we are by each other. But his car had died and his wife, Ellen, was away.
CLIENT: Sometimes I don't...I feel like I don't like the person for a moment, as much, when they express how much I mean to them.
CLIENT: Not always, but sometimes; like they aren't playing it cool or something.
CLIENT: So it would be a lot easier if you did that.
CLIENT: Then I could have a moment of writing you off; and ignoring you. And then it would come back to some kind of better (ph) equal [at the end] (ph).
THERAPIST: I see. My instructions are pretty clear.
CLIENT: Harvesting sunflowers is really...I don't know; it's just vivid. [00:05:11] (inaudible at 00:05:16) a vivid experience.
CLIENT: We'll keep talking about it, even though you're not. The sunflowers are in a row, in rows, like everything on the farm. And they track the sun, so they're all facing the same direction. And they're huge. [00:06:01] And they get bigger and bigger as they age. Then their petals start falling off.
CLIENT: And you can't harvest them with a knife or scissors; you...got to use these very sharp...I don't know, garden clippers. [00:09:00]
THERAPIST: Clippers?
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. And the diameter of these stalks is very big, so they're kind of intimidating; with the bees and the big, giant (inaudible at 00:09:15) and how heavy the plants are when you have to start carrying them.
CLIENT: What are you thinking about?
THERAPIST: Well...
THERAPIST: ...I was thinking that maybe the...what you were describing kind of...connects in here, a bit, what you described. [00:12:09] Like with your...landlord. In other words, am I going to react (inaudible at 00:12:27)...
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: [Laughs]
CLIENT: [Laughs]
THERAPIST: [Laughs] ...to your description of what it's like to harvest the sunflowers and be on the farm doing that or play it cool? And it seems to me that part of the...the...were I (inaudible at 00:13:08), and then you (inaudible at 00:13:12), makes me think a little bit of harvesting.
CLIENT: Hmm.
THERAPIST: In a way, when you felt like you could have harvested your landlord a little bit.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm; hmm.
THERAPIST: Which, I think, for you as you say is an ambivalent thing. Something, on the one hand, I think you want to do and work to do; and on the other hand, something that you don't want.
CLIENT: Because of his reaction?
THERAPIST: Yeah; I think you're ambivalent about his reaction. [00:14:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. But I think I really like it. I think I like seeing that I can touch (inaudible at 00:14:11) in that way, and seeing that I can touch you in a way (inaudible at 00:14:15).
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: There's a lot of death and birth and rapid change. And rapid change on all scales (inaudible at 00:14:46) a seed; to a plant; to flowers; to flowers dying; to the next crop, all within the course of a month or two. [00:15:00]
CLIENT: That relationship is really nice, because it's...it's like this easel (ph) or a playground, where there's really absolutely nothing required. So...everything and anything seems new and special. [00:16:03] And is.
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Guess I do that here, too, sometimes. No?
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:18:19)
CLIENT: Yeah, I do. I did a very daughterly thing yesterday, which is my...someone, maybe me or my mom, I forget who gave my dad this gift certificate, but we gave him a gift certificate to this local, family-run spa in our little village in Virginia. And...he doesn't want to use it. [00:19:01] He has ","P1-N400A91":"before; he has gone to the spa before and gotten a massage, but he's like, I don't know, "I don't have time. It's not really my priority. Someone else would get a lot more use out of it."
THERAPIST: [Laughs]
CLIENT: [Laughs] I'm laughing because I don't know where we left it (ph). I think we left it where we could get side-by-side chair neck and the shoulder massages; but he was wondering if there would be this wine, because-I was like, "Well, pedicures are more ridiculous. Don't you want to do that?" He's ","P1-N400B91":"like (crosstalk at 00:21:57).
THERAPIST: By the way, because I'm glad to know there's someone more difficult than me. [00:22:00]
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Laughs]
CLIENT: He is difficult. But he's so cute. [Chuckles] So pedicures are more ridiculous, so we're not going for them. Chair massages are more useful to both of us, but we don't know if we can drink wine; don't know if we can be side by side.
THERAPIST: [Laughs]
CLIENT: [Chuckles] But I'm happy because-
THERAPIST: There are so many considerations, my goodness!
CLIENT: It turned into Dad giving away this gift certificate without any fuss and now there's tons of fuss.
CLIENT: So it felt like a daughterly thing to do. [00:23:00]
CLIENT: There are people who are more difficult than you at times.
THERAPIST: I'm sure.
THERAPIST: No, I meant, (inaudible at 00:24:24) was something like, "Oh, so that's where, maybe where it comes from." In other words...the way it can be sometimes with me from him. And what you were just describing, maybe [there's some reflection] here of that.
CLIENT: Of what part?
THERAPIST: The whole shebang. You're going to do the daughterly thing and sort of kindly and affectionately and in a daughterly way seduce him into using the thing. [00:25:06]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And he's going to be sort of...pretend to be, in a way, a little oblivious of what's going on and just sort of particular about what he wants and a little bit like, "Oh, well, I don't know. I guess. Yeah, but can I do this?" A little bit childlike, I guess, about it. (Crosstalk at 00:25:30).
CLIENT: Like everything; a lot of things.
THERAPIST: And then there's this push and pull between you, which sounds very nice.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And this sort of a-he sounds like he can be difficult in the most wonderful way, I guess. That is how it sounded to me.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. So I'm like him, here? Or you're-? [00:26:00]
THERAPIST: I guess it reminded me-like I felt like there are some echoes of that, here, where you're you and I'm him, and-
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: I'm not trying to say I'm difficult in a wonderful way; just difficult. But it feels...the way you go about it seems a little similar to what you described with him.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And some other contrast with the...with your landlord, who seems, in a way, a little bit easier to harvest.
CLIENT: He's so easy.
THERAPIST: As compared to your dad, who is sort of...not so. (Crosstalk at 00:26:59)
CLIENT: Yeah, he's not-yeah, it makes it interesting. He wanted a father-daughter dance at our wedding, which totally surprised me, because...I don't know. It's something that we would make a lot of fun of together. And it surprised me that he-I mean, it's didn't surprise me, but it-I didn't-I was unprepared ","P1-N400FF1":"for this question of..."Well, are we going to have a dance together?" And by that point this is two days before the wedding, so in the wedding, in the...well, he might have meant-he might said something months before, but he asked me, directly. [00:28:05] I was like, "I don't know." By that point, ","P1-N400FF2":"we (ph) can have whatever we (ph) want.
THERAPIST: [Laughs]
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Laughs] What day is it?
CLIENT: I was so not feeling like honoring much more than what was already so structured; honor it in such a structured way.
CLIENT: I don't know, it suggests to me that there's so much unsaid from him. In the way you said that he's trying to be-or pretending to be oblivious in this nice, cute way.
THERAPIST: [Sighs] Yeah. I guess, probably. I don't really know how that works. I mean, you can-your psychologist or psychiatrist can pink (ph) paper somebody, which means to...it kind of forcibly hospitalize someone. But I don't know what the logistics are; I mean, if somebody's at their house or whatever ","P1-N401191":"and he's-
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: -going to send an ambulance there and they say, "Well, I'll be somewhere else," then you probably call the police. But I don't know exactly-
CLIENT: Hmm.
THERAPIST: -what happens.
CLIENT: So Fernando called Jeremy. He's at the hospital. They've taken away all of his stuff. He doesn't have phone. And Fernando's supposed to come to our wedding that day. And Jeremy and Fernando lived together for a year, the last year of (ph) college.
THERAPIST: Did Fernando hospitalize before?
CLIENT: No. But Fernando...he's been my like my worst fear realized, and I think a lot of the unconscious or sort of very fast anxiety that comes up is sometimes around what happened to Fernando, which is he lost control; he was hospitalized; all his stuff was taken away; and he missed the wedding. ","P1-N4012D1":"[00:36:10] And he has no family around him, though his family showed up really soon.
THERAPIST: Yeah. He's had that (inaudible at 00:38:11)?
CLIENT: Yeah. But Fernando's very-I mean, he's a-all of Jeremy's friends who aren't his musician friends from college are neuroscientists. So there's five of them, including Jeremy. Jeremy's very reluctant to be academic about anything; but Fernando's very...he's very against the system.
THERAPIST: [I'm here five minutes] (ph). You mean...? [00:40:00] Are you talking about a writing retreat or a hospitalization?
CLIENT: A hospitalization.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: And he totally just took it up as his thing. He was there for two months, every day. It's the sort of thing where you show up and you go home.
THERAPIST: Yeah, a partial hospitalization. Is that Hoag?
CLIENT: Could you imagine that some famous writers have been there?
THERAPIST: There have been a number of famous writers (inaudible at 00:40:32).
CLIENT: He was at Hoag, then. So we saw him a couple times and heard all about this place and all about the Fernando version of it. And...yeah, it was...
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:40:50) like Cheshire. It's on the other side of Cheshire.
CLIENT: Oh.
THERAPIST: It's still, to me, the best psychiatric hospital around. [00:41:06] But its heyday was in the 60s and 70s.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: It was a...sort of beautiful grounds. It's very scenic. A lot of wealthy people and successful (ph) artists-
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: -were hospitalized there. And then there was another hospital in town that was also in Frederick (ph). It was well-known more for people without money or...
CLIENT: I see.
THERAPIST: You know, a different social (inaudible at 00:41:39).
CLIENT: Do you have to pay to go there?
THERAPIST: I don't think now is different than any place else. They have some units there that are just self-pay, but it's really not-it's not different in the way that it was back then anymore. [00:42:04]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. It's seems like it's (inaudible at 00:42:06) some of that (inaudible at 00:42:08).
THERAPIST: Yeah, there may be some.
CLIENT: Or maybe Fernando was needing that (inaudible at 00:42:19). He was supposed to have graduated from his Brown science writing master's program that week or something. It was very hard for me. But he's well.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:42:51); but engage much. [00:43:00]
CLIENT: I asked Jeremy if he had any lingering things from that moment a couple days ago. And we never really talked about this. He said he thought a lot about it around that time and hasn't...it hasn't been difficult for him. And I believe him. His sensing (ph) versus my intuition and (inaudible at ","P1-N4016F1":"00:43:47) is become so clear to me; as is my perceiving him. [00:44:00] Versus the judgment one.
CLIENT: What time tomorrow?
THERAPIST: 10:00.
CLIENT: Cool.
