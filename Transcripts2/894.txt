TITLE: Client "R", Session March 28, 2014: Client discusses therapist-related feelings of love and attachment.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses therapist-related feelings of love and attachment.
THERAPIST: Good morning.
CLIENT: Good morning.
THERAPIST: I have the Wednesday 4:30 time again next week if you like.
CLIENT: If I can handle it. (pause) How does that one possibly bothering you?
THERAPIST: It isn’t yet, but I think it might and it might bother you in the next ten minutes. You know I’m not very good at those strong-man projects. (pause) [00:01:13]
CLIENT: Thanks for sitting with me through that. It was excruciating.
THERAPIST: Sure. (long pause) [00:02:12] It did seem to be excruciating.
CLIENT: Yeah, not (inaudible at 00:02:26) reminded me of some very, very big hysterical tantrums when I was younger, not altogether in the moment in some moments yesterday. (pause) [00:03:12] But with more anxiety or like a softer, quieter, more adult version. (pause) There were times when I’m ","P1-N400191":"remembering when my parents wouldn’t let me do something that I really wanted to do that I thought I should be able to do. [00:04:08] Not that funny in the moment.
THERAPIST: I’m not smiling at your not being able to do what you wanted to do; it’s just that I hadn’t imagined that’s the way it was related to yesterday.
CLIENT: Yeah, it was more like visceral. It didn’t actually feel that way yesterday, but when I had felt a similar sense of lost identity or something, my insides were spilling out and there was no container; and now I understand. [00:05:20] And actually it was too big for the people around me. ","P1-N4001D1":"Those are the times that I’m reminded of, not that it seemed like you didn’t understand altogether though. I do think part of what was so bad was that I didn’t get it that you understood or maybe didn’t understand that I didn’t (inaudible at 00:06:06). [00:06:06]
THERAPIST: It seemed like you were feeling ones that I didn’t understand. Also, I was sort of smiling because maybe it had something to do with the sense that I wouldn’t let you do something.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I’ve put my finger on what I didn’t understand yesterday about what I thought you were feeling. [00:07:01] I forget what I tried to say about it yesterday, but that you were scared.
THERAPIST: Right. Scared and sort of protecting myself.
CLIENT: I think the whole time I was feeling really, really aware and really concerned about how much pressure I was putting on you or how much pressure I felt like I was putting on you. (pause) It didn’t feel like I was just over here managing or containing. [00:08:04] It felt like I was trying ","P1-N400251":"to give it to you or waiting or wanting something from you about it, or looking to you for some way through. (pause)
THERAPIST: I think maybe wanting me to do something about it and also, I think, probably at some level believing that it was kind of my fault. [00:09:18]
CLIENT: Yes. Like how badly I was feeling it was your fault or that I wasn’t getting what I want was your fault?
THERAPIST: I’m thinking more the latter. (pause)
CLIENT: Well it is your fault. [00:10:00]
THERAPIST: Well, yes and no, I think. It is my fault I’m not acting more the way you want. The issue of whether it’s my fault that you were feeling the way you felt, I think is a little more complicated.
CLIENT: That’s not your fault; and that’s mostly me.
THERAPIST: Yes, but I guess I think the pressure had something to do with that.
CLIENT: I think there were things you could have said that would have made it easier, for sure. [00:10:05] Which you kind of did. It kind of felt like, at the end, you were drowning and floundering and saving yourself or something that I think was more related to the hug. [00:11:25] (pause) I mean, ","P1-N400351":"I think you’re right; there is more to the hug and I’m glad you said it.
THERAPIST: Or I guess you’re saying it felt like I was reacting to the pressure.
CLIENT: I was so caught up in the pressure. I don’t know what you were doing, but I was reacting to the pressure (inaudible at 00:11:58) [00:11:59] (pause) You seemed stressed or something.
THERAPIST: Stressed or distressed?
CLIENT: Stressed stressed. Were you? (long pause) [00:12:57]
THERAPIST: I don’t think I’m going to answer that now, but yeah, I think I’m (inaudible at 00:13:19).
CLIENT: Well you seemed it to me. (long pause) [00:14:07]
THERAPIST: I gather you’re saying you were acutely aware through a lot of yesterday of feeling like I was stressed from you putting me under all this pressure to make you feel better one way or another.
CLIENT: Or you were stressed about how sad I was or something, and my sadness was so . . . [00:15:03] I was trying to give it to you or something. I was not just with it over here.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) I think you were in a pretty tight spot, wanting to give it over to me or for me to do something about it and imagining or feeling like I was really overwhelmed by it. [00:16:02]
CLIENT: Or (inaudible at 00:16:06)
THERAPIST: I don’t think you felt like I was a little overwhelmed. I think you’re pretty concerned about me, I guess is what I’m saying.
CLIENT: I wanted to actually read you and not also be [reading me,] (ph?) more of that.
THERAPIST: I know. I’m not speaking to, in some sense, what I think you realistically thought; more to how it felt and what your impressions were. Those are probably closer to your anxiety. [00:17:01] I appreciate that’s different from how it looks if you step back and think about it.
CLIENT: Yeah, it’s pretty different. That’s what’s so scary about the state that I was in. That’s pretty different from what it’s like when I step back, but there is no option to step back, in the moment.
THERAPIST: Sure. That’s what a tantrum is, I guess, in part. (pause) [00:18:04]
CLIENT: It didn’t feel like a tantrum, but it did feel like a tantrum. (ph?) It had the same tunnel vision paralysis and despair. My parents had different reactions. My dad was like “please stop crying; it hurts me to see you cry.” [00:19:02] My mom would leave. My dad would leave, ","P1-N400551":"too, eventually; and that was it. I kind of get it because look at me now. I’m okay. (both laugh) But yeah, it seems more and more like a fear of leaving us or something.
THERAPIST: My sense is that it was not good for you. There would be other kids for whom that would probably work fine or reasonably. They might have been irresponsible. I don’t know, but I’m just saying . . . [00:20:05]
CLIENT: No, it’s not that they were irresponsible. For what types of kids would that be a better thing to do?
THERAPIST: I think there are some kids who need some space for that and, if there is somebody there, it feels too close or intrusive or over-stimulating and (inaudible at 00:20:37) leave the state, but I feel like leave the room or kind of back off of it, they settle down and that’s actually more ","P1-N4005B1":"helpful. But I don’t think that’s you. [00:20:59]
CLIENT: No. If I had been scooped up into a hug, I probably would have had a melting, probably.
THERAPIST: That’s an interesting thought. (pause)
CLIENT: Yeah, it is an interesting thought.
THERAPIST: Obviously, I don’t think that’s all the hug is about, but my thought was, I imagine, that’s part of it.
CLIENT: I didn’t get that, so then I kind of through various ways of seeing Tammy and Michael, and also the way that Jeremy treats me, which is very much in that similar vein, maybe I’m starting to treat myself in the way that I want you to treat me. [00:22:17] It’s making me look ","P1-N400651":"at those tantrums differently. I talked with him about it. I haven’t talked to them about the tantrums so much, but when I talked to them about times that I’m uncontrollably sad – my parents – they say “well, you always got over it.” (pause) [00:23:04] Coming here ","P1-N400652":"today, it was on my mind, like what does that mean? (pause)
THERAPIST: I imagine that’s probably something that you feel very much from me, too. I’m not saying that’s what I’ve said or that’s what my point is, but kind of what I’ve said is that you’ll get over it. [00:23:53] (long pause)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I guess thinking about it, I’m not really imagining it was intentional in having the tone that I did, which I imagine can feel a bit dismissive.
CLIENT: When?
THERAPIST: Just then, when I said “oh, yes, but you’ll get over it.” Again, I don’t think you think that’s where I’m coming from in that sort of dismissive way, but I think when you feel like I should be doing something to make you feel better and I’m not, that ","P1-N4006F1":"that’s part of what my attitude is and it hurts like theirs did. [00:25:12] (long pause) [00:26:12]
CLIENT: I don’t want to talk about it anymore.
THERAPIST: Okay. (long pause) [00:29:51]
CLIENT: I’m thinking about love with and without attachments. (pause) I love you and I also attach to you, like attach you (inaudible at 00:30:14), but I think for me with you. (pause) Why am I looking for qualities that feel like love without attachment? (pause) Do you know what I mean?
THERAPIST: If I’m understanding, it is loving me and the things that you’re attached to that go along with that are not the same thing. [00:31:54] Like you may want me to do something about your anxiety or sadness and there are many attachments in that, and that may have something to do ","P1-N400771":"with you loving me, but it’s not the same thing.
CLIENT: [Yeah, they go like that.] (ph?)
THERAPIST: And what you said you’re looking for is the . . .
CLIENT: I’m looking for it everywhere, [but especially here.] (ph?) [00:32:59] It makes it hard to kind of dig in with you, get to the attachment, sometimes, if I’m always trying to orient myself to just that.
THERAPIST: I see. One reason we talk a lot about this is because it leads to that. (pause) [00:34:05]
CLIENT: Yeah, I think I get it.
THERAPIST: I mean, I can elaborate. Sitting with the more attached stuff and the feelings around it, [needs and fantasy surround it,] (ph?) and putting it into words and thinking about it, tends to be gradually sort of freeing. [00:35:09] (long pause) [00:35:58]
CLIENT: It feels like I’m trying so hard to go in that direction. I feel like I’m on my high horse, but it occurs to me that there are lots of people who aren’t trying so hard or aren’t bringing as much. [00:36:57] No, I think what I’m feeling is that I feel like I’m ","P1-N400851":"bringing so much initiative and it’s still holding me up. A lot of times, it doesn’t feel possible to keep going, so my initial thought is “what are all these other people doing?” (inaudible at 00:37:44) But I think I’m frustrated or overwhelmed by how overwhelming it is ","P1-N400852":"and how little it feels like there isn’t much that I can really do that much about. [00:38:07] For example, saying and talking about and thinking about the attachment stuff is one thing, but then there is also going home and running and going to my meditation class and doing my headstand practice ","P1-N400853":"and getting a good night’s sleep. All of that feels like in the service of, and yet it’s still so excruciating and slow, like how could you possibly stay in business? [00:39:08]
THERAPIST: It’s like how God-damned long and excruciating all of this is?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You feel overwhelmed and you’re not stopping and you’re motivated and disciplined and focused and follow things through. What about people who aren’t that way?
CLIENT: What about Jeremy? What about the Jeremy’s? (inaudible at 00:39:36) (pause) Yeah, like all of your other patients. (pause) [00:40:01]
THERAPIST: And mostly [they just nap.] (ph?) (both laugh)
CLIENT: That’s pretty funny. (pause) A lot of times it feels like I can’t stop because I love you too much and you’re so lucky that that’s true; and I’m lucky that’s true and that’s the only thing sometimes (inaudible at 00:40:50) a lot of times I have.
THERAPIST: We should stop for now.
CLIENT: Really?
THERAPIST: We have to stop.
CLIENT: Okay.
