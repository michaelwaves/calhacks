DESCRIPTION: Client discusses books and reading, and how many books have had an impact on her psyche. Client discusses the feeling of being tossed around and people intentionally hurting her.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:00:03)
CLIENT: Oh okay. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Good morning.
CLIENT: Good morning. (PAUSE) So I responded to a Facebook plea for, to borrow a book last night which somehow ended up... It's entirely my fault. It's not like they asked me to do this. It had been me, "Yeah, sure. I'll drive your book down tomorrow after I get off of work." It was one of those things ","P1-N400111":"where it was like it's going to be difficult for one of us and I was going to be driving home from work anyway. [00:00:59]
THERAPIST: No. [00:02:01]
CLIENT: Okay. Well, there's this series about (inaudible at 00:02:05) young adult series. But it's fairly grim. It's basically about the way media, violence, and exploitation serves as a tool of the state to control citizens.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And then they still made a movie. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: And it's like, no, the whole book is about how it's terrible to like exploit teens murdering one another for public entertainment. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And if you watch the movie... I'm not surprised at that. I just like... (PAUSE) [00:03:00]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And then... (PAUSE) There's like a... (PAUSE) I don't know. It's funny because, you know, basically all of my friends watch or read Game of Thrones at this point. [00:07:05]
THERAPIST: Was that (inaudible) on Saturday?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. We were talking about books and, you know, I was saying that like I've turned back into the kind of reader who can't really sit down but I can't stand up or get up without finishing the book. So I'll just sit down and read the whole book or at least how long it is. And he was saying ","P1-N4003B1":"that he does a lot of book reviews and he was saying he's become incapable of reading fast. He just read slowly because that's how he reads to review a book. (PAUSE) And I can't read slowly. So if I like, if I'm going to review something or talk about it, I read it once and then think about it for a ","P1-N4003B2":"couple of days and then I just read it again. [00:11:05]
THERAPIST: Was that the... (PAUSE) I'm unclear. You were disturbed by the present conversation that you described or...
CLIENT: No, no. (PAUSE) It's like... (PAUSE) So I was describing... I was saying that I like unfortunately read the introduction to this book. And somebody else introduced it and basically, as far as I could tell, his purpose seemed to be to tell the reader like, "This author knows more theories than ","P1-N400451":"you do. So you should read it and be impressed." And that doesn't really go so well for me. [00:15:01]
THERAPIST: Are there any... (PAUSE) For you a big part of the danger there is somebody's going to get hurt, either what you say is going to really disturb the other person or what they say about is really going to hurt you.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I worry more about what I say disturbing the other person. (PAUSE) [00:22:00]
THERAPIST: I think it's similar to what came up here yesterday and also through what you're saying about how you like to read books where (PAUSE) it's tough when you can't predict what's going to happen.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Yeah. I don't like that. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: You're always kind of waiting for it whether because you don't feel like you (inaudible at 00:23:37) reprocessed it or arranged it kind of clearly in your head kind of primarily before talking about it or in the kind of way you speed through what you're reading. [00:24:01]
CLIENT: I mean, I don't... To be honest, I don't feel like I speed through books. Like I can actually read fast. I can read it the pace that I want, like that seemed normal to me. Like I don't think I read fast because I want to find out what happens. (PAUSE) It's more like deciding whether to commit ","P1-N400611":"to a book is tough. (PAUSE) [00:25:00]
THERAPIST: I think it may have made you uncomfortable there to tell me I was wrong.
CLIENT: No (inaudible at 00:25:31) (PAUSE) You know, I do it (inaudible) makes me comfortable. So... (PAUSE) [00:26:00]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:26:27) the other person's going to handle it and then that may come back to you in how they respond or maybe more accurately, the way in which you might feel guilty may be very difficult for you to handle. But I think that's a little... (PAUSE) Maybe the first step in this ","P1-N4006B1":"is whether the other person can handle it. (PAUSE) [00:27:00]
CLIENT: Probably should be. (PAUSE) Yeah. (PAUSE) I don't know. So like when I (PAUSE) try to like talk about, you know, being depressed as though it is not really such a big deal... I think I'm worried about hurting them but I think I'm more worried about them hurting me. [00:28:03]
THERAPIST: I... (PAUSE) [00:33:00]
CLIENT: No. I said the opposite.
THERAPIST: You said then obviously just now, you know, you're worried people are going to, yeah, see a bruise and say, "Oh, I'll punch it." (PAUSE) [00:35:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) I didn't notice I was saying different things until you pointed that out. I didn't feel like I was changing my mind. (PAUSE) I don't know. I don't know what to do about it. [00:36:01]
THERAPIST: Maybe your experience of those sorts of context of interactions (PAUSE) isn't that coherent in a way. Like, in other words, you're having different reactions, you know, in quick succession at the same time and are sort of in touch with (PAUSE) like intermittently in touch with each one. [00:37:03]
CLIENT: Or (inaudible at 00:37:19) I don't know. (PAUSE)
THERAPIST: I guess one thing it (PAUSE) could help to explain is how you kind of feel one way at the time and different later. Like it seemed like that was so upsetting or should have been so upsetting. But later I was so upset.
CLIENT: Which happens to me a whole lot. (PAUSE) [00:38:00]
THERAPIST: Right. (PAUSE) And... (PAUSE) [00:39:00]
CLIENT: Like I was talking about you?
THERAPIST: Well, I'm sure you were talking about me.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) That's not a question.
THERAPIST: But, I mean, I guess I think about it that way. (PAUSE) You were angry about it. There was like a bit of that directed at me but also at, you know, the people in general who do that. It's a little like... It reminds me of (inaudible at 00:40:59) or The Hunger Games as you just described it. [00:41:07]
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) You know, I can't remember... I can't remember anybody doing that to me deliberately since I was a kid but that was like every interaction I had with my peers when I was a kid. So... [00:42:15]
THERAPIST: It's very interesting. Like (PAUSE) you just said, "I hadn't realized I was intentionally (inaudible) doing that when I was a kid." [00:43:09]
CLIENT: Yeah. I guess, I mean, like... (PAUSE) I can't remember a time when people have actually done that but I can't... I don't know how to have that conversation in which I'm not, that's not the thing I'm most afraid of. (PAUSE) [00:44:00]
THERAPIST: It seems to me like... (PAUSE) (SIGH) (PAUSE) You're working pretty hard, I think, to forget how often that happens. It happens all the time. (PAUSE) Not that (PAUSE) you know, other people don't mean it but in a way it kind of doesn't matter (inaudible) I mean, many times, in other interactions, ","P1-N400B11":"I guess, with James, certainly with me... (PAUSE) [00:45:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) No. I think you're right.
THERAPIST: Sometimes you're very clear about it I think or you say things that make it seem to me like you're very clear about it and very in touch with that and then other moments, I don't think I have as much these days. (PAUSE) I mean, in a way, I appreciate it. Like at some level you know that neither ","P1-N400B71":"James nor I are generally intending to be hurtful. [00:45:57]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Or the other people in your life. But we talk explicitly about it feeling as though...
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I remember now. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Yeah. I see. Okay. Well, we should stop for now.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I'll let you know (inaudible at 00:46:21) but otherwise I'll see you next week.
CLIENT: Okay.
