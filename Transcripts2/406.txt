TITLE: Client "J", Session May 14, 2013: Client discusses the relationship he has with his kids during his marital separation. Client discusses how he is getting into shape and being more active.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses the relationship he has with his kids during his marital separation. Client discusses how he is getting into shape and being more active.
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: Okay. Go on thinking that. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) Every Tuesday feels like Friday now. It's really bizarre. I've got to go into the office today because some crazy woman called me yesterday and after I agreed to help her, she starts hounding me about it and she starts crying and just... (PAUSE) ","P1-N4000D1":"Basically her father in law has given them a house to live in. However it's in irrevocable trust with the Brianefit of the daughter. And she's basically worried about all these things that are beyond her control. I can tell without reading this document that she has really... She's fucked. She's worried ","P1-N4000D2":"about if her husband... Because it just says "wife" in the trust.
THERAPIST: Oh wait. Sorry. Her father gave...
CLIENT: Father in law. [00:01:03]
THERAPIST: Father in law. To protect the daughter but she's not his daughter.
CLIENT: She's the daughter... Her daughter, the grandchild, is the Brianeficiary of the trust. So ultimately the house goes to the daughter.
THERAPIST: The granddaughter?
CLIENT: The granddaughter. Yes. Sorry.
THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah. Now I understand.
CLIENT: Yeah. So, you know, she wants to make changes and do all... She's worried that, number one, if she gets divorced, she's got nothing.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Which that was the whole reason it was set up this way. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) She's right about that.
CLIENT: Yeah. You know, and she's upset because she has to take care of the house and she's not going to, you know... And I think to myself, you know, this woman's very selfish. And so you're given a house to live in and you're complaining that you have to keep it up. I mean, are you paying mortgage? ","P1-N400251":"Are you paying rent? You know? Map it out and go live somewhere else and see what you have to do. [00:02:01]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But, you know, I'll bill her. (PAUSE) But I've got to go to Pembroke (ph) today because she slipped the trust under my door. She couldn't e-mail it or fax it. (inaudible at 00:02:23) So... (PAUSE) So I watched the kids on Sunday morning. We had a little... Ian (ph) had strep throat so he was, ","P1-N4002B1":"you know, wound up and just had a lot of energy and they were going to Jess's (ph) parents later in the day. And, you know, Ian was talking, Lucille (ph) taking whatever she was holding and running around her. You know... And as I'm leaving, Jess says to me, she's like, "You know, you need to..." She ","P1-N4002B2":"says that my taunting of Ian, which I wouldn't say what I do is taunting, is causing him to taunt Lucille. [00:03:09]
THERAPIST: Thanks.
CLIENT: Do you need a tissue?
THERAPIST: I've already got some. Thanks.
CLIENT: I'm sure I've shown you how to make a handkerchief dance.
THERAPIST: Yes. Yep. (PAUSE)
CLIENT: (SIGH) (PAUSE) Bless you. Bless you. Allergies.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: All this (inaudible at 00:03:55) yesterday.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (PAUSE) [00:04:11]
CLIENT: Better? (PAUSE) So couldn't it just be that genetically he has my gene for taunting and that no matter what I do he's going to taunt her?
THERAPIST: Could be?
CLIENT: I mean, I just mess with the kid. You know? He's very smart and he's very... You know, he tries to call me on everything. You know? So I just give it back to him and he... (PAUSE) You know, a lot of the kids I talk to a little sarcastically or whatever, they just kind of give up, ignore me, ","P1-N400451":"and (inaudible) but he wants to win the battle. So... (PAUSE) He's obsessed with this... I do this... "You want to see the fastest draw in the West? Do you want to see it again? Do you want to see it again?"
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) [00:04:57]
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) He is dead set, hell Briant on proving that I am not drawing my... You know, he wants to tie things to my hand. He wants to... You know... So... And this has been going on for weeks. It's not like it's just a one-time thing. You know?
THERAPIST: I guess to me (PAUSE) the question really is about, you know, what's the feel of it. You know, if it's... And I guess, especially what's the feel of it to him? Is it just fun? This is part of hanging out and he enjoys it (inaudible at 00:05:41) because, you know, there's actually a lot of ","P1-N4004B1":"affection and sympathy sometimes in teasing.
CLIENT: He gets frustrated sometimes. You know?
THERAPIST: Or does it feel a little to him... [00:05:55]
CLIENT: I'll say things to him, you know (inaudible at 00:06:01) I guess. I'll say to him... He's doing something wrong and I'm telling him to stop, I'm like, you know... He kind of just looks at me or keeps doing it, I'll go, "Fine. Just never, ever use the iPhone again." You know? But that's, you ","P1-N400511":"know... That's not really a taunt. I do that to all the kids on the soccer team. I say, you know, "If you whine and you ask me to go in the game, you're never going to play the rest of the day." And if they keep whining, I'm like, "Okay. Next week you're not coming into the game." And then... And I'm ","P1-N400512":"telling like all six kids who are crying on the side line they're not ever going to get to go in again. They're believing me. So and like they keep whining, you know, I'm like, "Okay. That's it. You guys aren't playing the rest of the season."
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: You know, there's like one or two kids who believe you.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: The rest just ignores you. You know? So I do that kind of stuff to Ian. You know, Jess, she just... She sees a problem and she just has to fix it and she's going to find the... You know, it can't be nature. Nature never causes anything to her. You know? [00:07:01]
THERAPIST: It's probably likely that...
CLIENT: I'm not taking his toy and going, "Heh, heh, heh, heh." You know, I'm not doing that to him.
THERAPIST: Well, he's her older brother so he's going to tease her unquestionably.
CLIENT: Of course. Of course.
THERAPIST: You might be contributing to it. I mean, it's not like there's just one reason he's doing it.
CLIENT: No. But there's no reason to, you know, admonish me.
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) I'm laughing because I get that... I feel like you're doing two things at once. One of them is, you know...
CLIENT: Pull out the "it's Cameron's (ph) fault." Go ahead.
THERAPIST: I'm not even saying you're doing anything wrong yet.
CLIENT: Yet.
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) Yeah. I think one thing you want is like to do the usual thing you do with Jess. [00:07:59]
CLIENT: I didn't say that. I didn't even have that tone of voice.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: I think you're embellishing. You're being overdramatic.
THERAPIST: Yes. I'm characaturing.
CLIENT: I think you're just taunting me.
THERAPIST: Really. You feel taunted?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) Like who's taunting who now?
CLIENT: I don't know. You're just... You're enjoying it too much I think.
THERAPIST: Well, if I'm making you feel bad, then I want to know about that. But if you're just giving me a hard time, having to avoid thinking about...
CLIENT: Well, I guess there's some... It's not something I'm like...
THERAPIST: Well, the other thing I think you're trying to do... Well, let me just get the second thing I want to say out before we get away from the topic completely. I think you're... [00:08:57]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And...
CLIENT: No. That's not actually accurate.
THERAPIST: Okay. What's that?
CLIENT: I want you to say, "Yeah. You know, you're probably not causing him to pick on his sister." That's all I want.
THERAPIST: It's fine. Just keep doing what you're doing. It's great. Don't even worry about it.
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: (SIGH) (PAUSE) Yeah. I mean, like I said, the important thing to me would be the feel of it and I do think he'd likely be taunting her whatever was going on between the two of you because (inaudible at 00:09:45) he's her older brother so of course he will. Now, you may be contributing to ","P1-N4009B1":"the tone of it or... For example, if you were making him feel really helpless and really ashamed, you know, which doesn't sound like you are but...
THERAPIST: If you were making him feel a certain way and you saw him making her feel exactly that way, whatever it was, you know, then the effect you're having would be important. You know? And you probably wouldn't want to do that to him. But, again, you know, I don't know what the feel of it is between ","P1-N4009F1":"the two of you and I don't know what it is between the two of them. So... (PAUSE) I can't really say. (PAUSE)
CLIENT: Well, it's like he doesn't... It's not like he gets frustrated. Maybe there's a little frustration. But he doesn't give up. Like I told him about this statute where parents are allowed to, you know, kick, punch, and poke their kid.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And they're not allowed to do that to their parents.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And I keep bringing it up and he keeps defending that there's no such law.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:11:01]
CLIENT: So it's not like he's crying or, you know...
THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, you've got to do the best you can to get a read on what his reaction is and you can also ask him. Like, yeah, you know...
CLIENT: I'm just building character for him. Just character.
THERAPIST: Well, if he says he doesn't like it, that...
CLIENT: He's never said he doesn't like it.
THERAPIST: I mean, you could say, "You know we joke around and it's fun and stuff. Does it ever really actually start to feel bad too? You know, most of the time I think it's fun but sometimes I kind of wonder or worry that it actually kind of makes you feel bad. Does it?" You could say something like ","P1-N400B91":"that. (PAUSE) [00:12:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. Like I guess this is a good example which I don't find to be taunting. He had strep throat, went home from school. So there was soccer practice at five. The next day he was going to go with me to a handball tournament (inaudible at 00:12:27) And I kind of forgot that he had strep on the ","P1-N400BD1":"way to soccer practice. So I'm like going to pick him up and I call Jess to tell her that I was running late. And she's like, "He's not going to soccer practice." And I'm like, "Oh yeah. Oh yeah." But she's like, "Hold on. He wants to talk to you." I'm like, "Hey buddy. How are you doing?" He's like, ","P1-N400BD2":""Fine." You know, it's like, "You know, Dad. My head hurts and I'm nauseous." "Well, how do you feel?" "I feel fine." You know, it's... The answer to that question is always the same.
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) [00:12:55]
CLIENT: And he says it...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...you know, like he means it. So... (PAUSE) He's like, "I'm fine." I'm like, "Yeah. Well, it's... Are you ready for soccer?" He's like, "I'm not going to soccer and I don't think I'm going to the handball tournament tomorrow either." I go, "Buddy. You're going to soccer. You're going to handball. ","P1-N400C51":"You're sleeping over tomorrow night. I'm outside the driveway. Let's go." And Jess says he's like laughing hysterically in the background. Like... She's upset about me doing this? I hear her laughing out loud in the background because apparently, he's like... Doesn't know what to think. He's like, you ","P1-N400C52":"know, wants to look out the window at the driveway. She's like, you know, "Daddy's just joking with you." You know, I mean...
THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.
CLIENT: He was fine. If anything, he was probably, you know, upset maybe that she was laughing at him. You know, but...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: He's kind of used to that stuff from me. You know, it doesn't seem to affect him. You know... (PAUSE) [00:14:00]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But there's still that seven year old that's like, "Maybe he is actually (inaudible at 00:14:21)
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: You know? Or he's just got this, you know, innate desire to prove me wrong...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...which he gets from his mom.
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) There's a gene for desire to prove Cameron wrong (inaudible at 00:14:39)
CLIENT: It's more a character flaw. So... (PAUSE) Yeah. (PAUSE) I felt a little guilty because I didn't feel bad at all that he had strep. [00:15:01]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Then I pick him up today, take him home, beat him up a little bit, taunt him. (PAUSE) [00:16:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Now I have this one.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: And she's going to turn around and buy something. So...
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: It's my old contact (inaudible at 00:16:45) sends me a deal every two or three years. I can't complain. (PAUSE) [00:17:00]
THERAPIST: Oh?
CLIENT: ...I would think. Well, I don't know. Pest control business is so funny. It just... It's never going to go away. There's always new bugs. And the big thing now is the bed bugs. You know?
THERAPIST: Oh really?
CLIENT: And that's big money to go in there and take care of that stuff. So...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: (SIGH) (PAUSE) It's kind of going nonstop. I'm not sure if I'm getting enough sleep. (PAUSE) I keep taking on things that... You know, like tomorrow, the mediation, the lawyer today, they're doing a training. [00:18:05]
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So she wants me to come. I usually just do it the first Wednesday of every month.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And she wants me to come in and in the morning when there's actually mediation going on, she wants me to take around a couple of people to shadow. So I agreed to do that, you know, like... (PAUSE) Not like I sleep in or anything like that but it's most of the day. I go work out and... (PAUSE) ","P1-N4010B1":"Thursday (inaudible at 00:18:39) report, I've got handball. (PAUSE) Soccer practice on Friday and (PAUSE) Marcia (ph) wants me to go to a concert in Vermont and (PAUSE) that's Friday. I guess Ian is going... Ian and I are going on a camping trip Saturday and Sunday to U.S.S. New Hampshire battleship. [00:19:03]
THERAPIST: Oh I think you mentioned this one. Yeah. That's pretty cool.
CLIENT: And... (PAUSE) Yeah. (PAUSE) (inaudible at 00:19:21) So... No more 9:20 games on Monday night like last night. (PAUSE) Games are so late you go to the bar before the game and after but you're kind of tired afterwards.
THERAPIST: That must make for an interesting game going to the bar before the game.
CLIENT: Not really.
THERAPIST: Oh. (PAUSE)
CLIENT: It's only a couple of beers. I mean, maybe for you that might, you know... Wobble out there. (PAUSE) [00:20:00]
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE)
CLIENT: I think kind of... I mean, obviously you can drink too much before a game. I go to the tournament on Saturday. I would have a beer every game. You know, drink a beer... I thought that helped with, you know, just my muscles and staying loose and keeping me happy. I mean, I'm not going to get ","P1-N4011D1":"drunk drinking four beers over the course of an entire afternoon. You know? It's when you go to the bar afterwards that you're drinking in succession. That's when, you know... (PAUSE) Assuming you don't eat any food. (PAUSE) (SIGH) (PAUSE) [00:21:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah. Wary.
CLIENT: So I don't want anything to follow that. (PAUSE) [00:22:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I mean, usually I would spend like, for Mother's Day, like seventy or eighty bucks. I think it was like 125 bucks. Flowers are like $35 apiece. I don't know what happened. You know?
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: They fuck you at the drive through. And they don't even deliver them. They deliver them through FedEx. They don't even deliver them with flower people anymore.
THERAPIST: Oh. [00:22:55]
CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) It's ProFlowers. They send them a box of flowers and a vase and they've got to put them all together. I did it once for Jess and she got all pissed off. You know...
THERAPIST: Because they delivered the flowers separate from the vase? Was she upset...
CLIENT: Yeah. I just gave her the box instead of taking it out and putting the flowers in the vase myself and... (PAUSE) So I was complaining that, you know, she didn't like gifts. She doesn't like when people give her gifts. But you didn't give her a gift. You gave her a bad gift. You know? This is ","P1-N401351":"the (inaudible at 00:23:37) (PAUSE) Never got me flowers ever. (PAUSE) Yeah. Marcia is having a birthday in two weeks. Twenty ninth. [00:24:01]
THERAPIST: Huh. (PAUSE)
CLIENT: The same thing happened last week. Tuesday felt like Friday. I kept thinking it was Friday. I kept thinking, "Oh, what do I have to do this weekend?" (PAUSE) I mean, once I played with the kids I just basically went home and slept. It's pretty exhausting. And I think I slept too much because ","P1-N4013D1":"I had trouble getting up yesterday and I had plenty of sleep, you know, because I took a nap. I went to bed early. (PAUSE) [00:26:00]
THERAPIST: I see. (PAUSE)
CLIENT: You've got to be doing something else.
THERAPIST: Well, it's good. A lot of the stuff you're doing is stuff you like to do. (inaudible at 00:26:41)
CLIENT: (inaudible) It'd be nice if I had some work in there. You know? (SIGH) (PAUSE) [00:27:00]
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: Thirteen... And then, you know, I want Ian to sleep over and, you know... Kitty (ph) was like, "Oh, you're not going to practice?" (inaudible at 00:27:41) (PAUSE) She's like, "What are you doing?" The first thing she says, "You going on a date?" I was like, "No, no." (PAUSE) What does she expect ","P1-N4014D1":"from me? [00:28:01]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: She can be a little mean. And it's funny. Her boyfriend Brian (ph) is the exact opposite. He doesn't complain about anything. And she just complains about everything. So...
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: I thought she met Marcia.
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Didn't Marcia go to her birthday party?
CLIENT: No. She didn't.
THERAPIST: This was when...
CLIENT: She was going to go. But I think Marcia was kind of confused about what was going on.
THERAPIST: Oh I see.
CLIENT: She thought it was just a daytime thing. Then I realized the picture... I showed a picture of Harry, of Marcia to Harry and Harry picks out her cleavage. So I yelled across the restaurant, "I don't remember Harry. Was the picture with the cleavage?" (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: I don't know who that embarrassed. Probably me more than anyone. (PAUSE) [00:30:00]
THERAPIST: Harry?
CLIENT: Marcia. Yeah. But Marcia was initially tired at dinner. It seemed initially like she wanted to go. Then she got her second wind as I'm getting very tired. We were at the bar, sitting at the bar stool...
THERAPIST: Wow. (PAUSE)
CLIENT: We were playing five games. It was fun though.
THERAPIST: How did you do?
CLIENT: We went four and one. The one game we lost, we lost on universe point which means it's tied at the last game point we're going to play, whoever wins, wins.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: And we came in fifth place because that loss was in our pool so that affected where we... We left our pool in second place so we couldn't play for first. We got sent into the middle bracket playing for fifth. [00:31:05]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: The four winners of the pools play for first place.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: So by losing that one point, the universe point...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Had we won that we could have played for first. So...
THERAPIST: And how many teams were in each bracket?
CLIENT: Actually, come to think of it, there were three pools with four teams... No. Four pools with three teams. No. Four pools, three pools with four teams. So they must have taken the top three and then the best of the second place teams as far as, either point differential or...
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:31:55)
CLIENT: What's that? Well, because they took the four teams up for the number one bracket.
THERAPIST: Okay. [00:32:01]
CLIENT: So they took three winners and then the next best because they needed to play two on two, two. So...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: We were in that middle bracket. Instead of playing for ninth, we were playing for fifth. So... But it was fun.
THERAPIST: That's good.
CLIENT: I kind of prefer those tournaments where, you know, you can goof around, make bad throws and, you know, it's like at the end of the game... They do this every so often. You play a senior one where all the old players get on the team. But one, Curtis (ph), had to go deal with his kids. So I've ","P1-N401A11":"got the handball during the, at the end zone. Everybody's just kind of moving towards me and it's this blob. And I'm like, "I'm throwing a hammer. Go, go." (LAUGHTER) It was ugly. But you can't really do that in a competitive game (inaudible at 00:32:51)
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: I don't throw very good hammers. So...
THERAPIST: What's a hammer?
CLIENT: A hammer's like an over...
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:32:59]
CLIENT: And occasionally I throw good hammers but, you know, it was really windy and I was throwing it crossfield into the wind, the hardest hammer to throw.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: It was completed.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:33:11)
CLIENT: Except at the end zone where it should have... It was five yards outside the endzone. So... (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Okay. (PAUSE)
CLIENT: I'm missing a tournament on Saturday. That's why I played... Initially, I wasn't going to play in this tournament because of soccer. Because I was going to play in the tournament this Saturday but then I remembered we (inaudible)
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So I was like, "Well, fuck that."
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I'm not playing this tournament and, you know... (PAUSE) I think it's helping me as much exercise as I'm doing, it's helping that I'm doing a lot of exercise. I'm in much better shape for May than I've been in a long time. I'm sore. You know, I'm tired. But... (PAUSE) [00:33:57]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And...
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:34:05)
CLIENT: Yeah. And having some... Like on a busy weekend or if I'm extra tired or whatever, having... This is the second week I haven't... I have two home work days, usually Saturday and Monday and I haven't been able to do it twice and this weekend was one of them. But I played in the tournament, you know, so...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Friday was just so busy. You know, I was going to do it on Friday and I just never got a chance.
THERAPIST: How long are your workouts at the gym?
CLIENT: Twenty, thirty minutes, depending, you know...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And when I trained with Eddie, the first time I did it was like 15 minutes. Now I'm down to a little over 30.
THERAPIST: Nice.
CLIENT: Every workout, he keeps adding more difficult stuff and I keep doing more. So I'm really feeling that rapid improvement curve. You know?
THERAPIST: Cool.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:34:57) I'm just eating too much. I feel like I'm getting fatter. [00:35:03]
THERAPIST: Yeah. And the leg workouts... Burpees in there?
CLIENT: No burpees. I do squats and pushups, leg raises and pushups. (PAUSE) And when I struggled to do just a few pushups, I'm like... On my max set, I'm doing like 20.
THERAPIST: Nice. (PAUSE) [00:36:00]
CLIENT: I think that's helping out a lot. You know, it's an expense. But...
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:36:09) It makes you feel better.
CLIENT: Yeah. Because he's doing it with the team like ten or fifteen bucks but it's just...
THERAPIST: Yeah. It works out better when you do it by yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah. And, you know, like it was cancelled. We didn't have a game so there was no workout. So like I just feel like, you know, the extra attention and the extra motivation, I can kind of... If I need to take a break...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...the whole system stops instead of everybody moving on and me, you know... So...
THERAPIST: Good. (PAUSE)
CLIENT: I talked to Mosby (ph) and... (LAUGHTER) He kind of thinks that the firing of Marcia is like this big amicable... Like everybody went away happy. You know? [00:37:07]
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: I didn't do anything to really dash that. I was like, "You know, she was pretty upset, you know, that day. But she's moving on."
THERAPIST: She was really upset about it?
CLIENT: No. But I mean, you know, there are different perspectives on what happened. He was saying that they told her that... You know, because she had talked about starting her own business that they were kind of like phasing her out and...
THERAPIST: Why did they fire her?
CLIENT: Things had happened a while ago, you know, that she screwed up and she admits screwing up. Like she wasn't (inaudible at 00:37:45) (LAUGHTER) Whoops. And so I think there's some confusion of her saying, "Oh, I'm going to get another job," and so they felt like they should, were looking for it ","P1-N402071":"or... I don't know. They were using... They were telling her that this, you know, they didn't want to wait for it to happen again, you know, where she was like doing better and not screwing up anymore. You know? [00:38:11]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But it happened very confrontationally and... And he's an awkward person. And... (PAUSE) Whatever. (PAUSE) In time, you know, it'll... Marcia was never really friends with Kerry (ph) to begin with. She was friends with Mosby. [00:38:59]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Like her really good friend from growing up is like really good friends with Mosby. This guy Carlton (ph).
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: He's a lunatic. (PAUSE) I just meant partywise...
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: He's just crazy. (PAUSE) I think they're all crazy. Mosby's from Fairfield (ph). He's definitely crazy on many levels. (PAUSE) Did you watch the hockey last night? I watched it while they were sucking and then played handball.
THERAPIST: Did they win? [00:39:55]
CLIENT: They scored two goals in the last 82 seconds to tie it up.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: And they won in overtime, game seven. So Ottawa winning four to two on the road, game seven...
THERAPIST: Right (inaudible at 00:40:11)
CLIENT: Yeah. So if you're a Ottawa fan, you're like, "Ahh." Manchester pulls the goalie, goal overtime.
