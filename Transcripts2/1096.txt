TITLE: Client "Ma", Session March 25, 2014: Client discusses suicide and her own opinions on mortality.
DESCRIPTION: Client discusses suicide and her own opinions on mortality.
CLIENT: Hi.
THERAPIST: Hi.
CLIENT: It always feels like a room for sitting down in rather than standing up in. (pause) (sigh) I still haven’t gotten the car fixed, which is mostly fine, except like both this week and last week, I’ve forgotten to tell Monica that we haven’t gotten the car fixed, until like the night before.
THERAPIST: There’s like (pause) somebody turned on friction or something?
CLIENT: Yeah. (laughter) Yeah. (pause) [0:06:00]-[0:07:00] (pause) (sigh) I read on Facebook last night that someone tracked down one of [] camps in the desert. And like, there’re broken gen bottles, and car parts, and the campfire and everything. There’ talking about it as just this like ","P1-N4001B1":"huge find for contemporary archaeology, and a big deal.
THERAPIST: No, I didn’t know that.
CLIENT: Yeah, he’s okay, but like the bike is totaled. I think he’s pretty shaken up, and sort of, (Austin)’s (ph) is not really a city that’s easy on bikes; it’s not really designed for it. All of us would be on him; it’s like, Papa’s just so bad. The peripheral ","P1-N400251":"vision is such like he just doesn’t pay attention to the things around him, like I’m afraid to cross the street with him. [0:10:40]
THERAPIST: It would distract him?
CLIENT: Yeah. It seems like in this case, it was clearly like the woman who hit him’s fault, because she was looking for a cell phone, and just came around the corner, and bam. (pause) It’s weird; so Papa’s like commuting on a bike, which is the most dangerous thing that you can do ","P1-N400291":"pretty much anywhere in America.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I don’t know. (pause) (chuckle) The (inaudible at 0:13:22) that comes to mind is like, “Well Amanda’s taking up white water kayaking, but I’m really the one with the death wish. (laughter) (pause) That feels so a little melodramatic to me.
THERAPIST: Mm?
CLIENT: That feels so melodramatic to me. (pause) [0:14:34] (pause) I was talking with a couple of friends from church at this party, and one of them is a – she’s like an (inaudible at 0:15:39) professor, I want to say. And the other is – he was like a practicing psychologist for awhile, ","P1-N400371":"now he works for the church.
THERAPIST: I imagine it’s really unbearable; it doesn’t feel like you can handle it for more than few more minutes.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And in a way, I guess part of the worst part is that’s actually not true.
CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckle) Yeah. (pause) [0:19:50] (pause) I just go through my day, like you know, there’s part of me that thinks like, well, I’ll get up and get dressed. But I’ll be dead before I get to work. Or I’ll go to work, but I’ll be dead before I get home. But you ","P1-N400471":"have to – you can’t act like that’s the case. Like you can’t – you can’t just stop. (pause) [0:20:50]-[0:23:50] (pause)
THERAPIST: It did seem to me like, you know, maybe some of the stuff you were talking about yesterday has something to do with how you are feeling so awful.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) (sigh) Yeah, I think that’s right. (pause) [0:24:50] (pause) I feel like I’m in this precarious position, and it feels like James’s putting me through.
THERAPIST: It occurred to me also like that first you were talking about with maybe some of the things that you’ve been saying so far today are actually related to that, in a sense that (pause) I don’t think, you know, clearly you’re not far from knowing that or being in touch with ","P1-N4004D1":"what you were upset about yesterday. [0:25:47]
CLIENT: Mm-mm.
THERAPIST: I mean you come in and sort of talk about ways you feel flaky or not together. I wonder if that’s in part a reference. You know, you may not be together; there’s like these things you’re really upset about, that you feel kind of distant, you know a bit distant from. And ","P1-N400531":"you just feel the upset, and then feel kind of shapeless, and (inaudible at 0:26:22) and unbearable. Then, you’re probably thinking about death, and not anticipating you’ll live through the next few minutes.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I tend to find it difficult to recall from week to week what we talk about in couples counseling. (sigh) (Are you surprised?) (ph) (laughter)
THERAPIST: (At times) (ph) it’s like in a way, you’re going to have, (sort of that you’re in a fog), in a way, like given how painful a (inaudible at 0:28:25). Then you want to be like, have I been here before?
CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah. Yeah. You know, I feel like after the point of couples counseling for me, it felt like I don’t want to talk about this stuff; I don’t want to think about it, and I won’t on my own. So it’s kind of thrown back in there. (pause)
THERAPIST: Like the eminence of the loss is so terrifying that you come apart, which brings about -
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah. (pause) (inaudible at 0:31:39) At one point, talking to Dr. (inaudible at 0:31:46), and she’s being pretty (confident,) (ph) and us saying like, well I want to have kids eventually, and like we’re really far away from that. (inaudible at 0:32:02) that’s ","P1-N400631":"what I want in the future.
THERAPIST: I imagine feeling kind of paralyzed, but stopping and watching it happen.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) But like I know, it’s like knowing that I could stop it, and then not (inaudible at 0:33:26). (crying) Like, I’m doing something wrong, and I can’t tell what it is.
THERAPIST: I see. (pause) [0:34:26] (pause) So, I think the problem of understanding this is like, the situation that you’re in, anticipating losing (inaudible at 0:34:52), and feeling like you’re going to make it happen, or you’re not going to be able to stop it happening, and you’re ","P1-N4006D1":"just going to watch it happen; kind of pass away I guess, like that’s sort of one of the most harrowing situations you can imagine.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Right now anyway.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: (laughter) (pause)
THERAPIST: I guess another aspect of it is, it seems almost predetermined and at the same time, in a way it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. Like clearly it makes emotional sense, and feels very much like that’s what’s happening. And there are some ways that like – there are ","P1-N400751":"some reasons in the world that you can think of, that would cause that. [0:36:21]
CLIENT: It doesn’t seem like it adds up; yeah.
THERAPIST: But it feels inevitable.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)
THERAPIST: And to credit like my point is, not to say that you are not being realistic, but just to say that (pause) it’s mysterious. You feel out of commission, and not clear why; but you do, I’m not doubting it, it’s just – [0:37:18]
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah. And you know, it’s like when James has said the things like I think about leaving sometimes. It’s like I sort of think about I always knew this would happen. (pause) Yeah. It’s like the exact expected worst today. [0:38:18] (pause)
THERAPIST: If James would be close at all really to knowing what that meant or looked like (pause)
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)
THERAPIST: Maybe I wouldn’t need him?
CLIENT: I hope not. (pause) [0:42:16] (pause)
THERAPIST: Like in that way, it’s kind of unclear whether I could understand or appreciate what I mean to you. (pause)
CLIENT: It feels like it doesn’t matter whether you do or not.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Like that’s not – (pause) yeah, it feels like it would be better if you didn’t. Even if you did, it’s not like that would change anything. (pause) [0:43:50] It might just make you feel worse. (pause)
THERAPIST: Because have you done anything that would why that would make you feel better? I mean in the same way that like if it’s pretty that James’s not getting that really hurt, maybe it’s because I’d be gone anyway.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don’t know. (pause)
THERAPIST: We should stop now.
